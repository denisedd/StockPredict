{"Headline": "Hong Kong Democracy Standoff, Circa 1960 ", "Date": "2014-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIn 150 years, the country that now poses as an exemplar of democracy gave our Hong Kong compatriots not one single day of it,\u201d People\u2019s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, said in a recent editorial. \u201cOnly in the 15 years before the 1997 handover did the British colonial government reveal their \u2018secret\u2019 longing to put Hong Kong on the road to democracy.\u201dBut documents recently released by the National Archives in Britain suggest that beginning in the 1950s, the colonial governors who ran Hong Kong repeatedly sought to introduce popular elections but abandoned those efforts in the face of pressure by Communist Party leaders in Beijing.\u201cWe shall not hesitate to take positive action to have Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories liberated,\u201d Liao Chengzhi, a senior Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, was reported to have said in 1960, referring to the areas under British administration that would later be returned to China.Another document recounts a meeting two years earlier, during which Premier Zhou Enlai told a British military officer that any effort to introduce even a modicum of self-governance to Hong Kong would be viewed as \u201ca very unfriendly act\u201d and a \u201cconspiracy,\u201d one he suggested would be seen as a move to set the colony on a path to independence.The threats had the desired effect. Britain made little effort to introduce electoral democracy in Hong Kong in the decades that followed.In addition to confirming that China\u2019s opposition to a democratic Hong Kong began almost a half-century earlier than was commonly known, the documents, coupled with published accounts of former colonial officials, also highlight how China\u2019s vehemence intensified in the early 1980s as the two sides began discussing Hong Kong\u2019s future. Then in the early 1990s, when Chris Patten, the last colonial governor, began aggressively supporting limited elections for the territory, China\u2019s opposition became more openly strident.In the end, Mr. Patten ignored China\u2019s claims that democracy would beget chaos and gave Hong Kong residents the right to elect 30 members of what was then a 60-member Legislative Council. The move so infuriated Lu Ping, the senior Chinese official then in charge of Hong Kong affairs, that he called Mr. Patten \u201ca man to be condemned through the history of Hong Kong,\u201d according to newspaper accounts at the time.Today\u2019s critics in Beijing are correct, however, in suggesting that Britain, which took over Hong Kong in 1842, came late to the democracy game. Britain\u2019s democratic impulses in the 1950s came after it had been ejected from India and the country was trying to head off revolts in several colonies. \u201cIt was at a time when Britain was introducing democracy in many of its colonies around the world, and the idea was Hong Kong should be treated the same,\u201d said Danny Gittings, an assistant professor of law at the University of Hong Kong. After the rebuff from China, Britain did not make a concerted push for popular elections until the 1990s, when it was on its way out. Britain hoped democracy would calm a citizenry anxious about its impending return to Communist China, historians say, and ensure the stability of British investments.It was Mr. Patten\u2019s recent defense of the protesters\u2019 goals that prompted the People\u2019s Daily attack. The newspaper\u2019s editorial acknowledged his role in promoting democracy in the 1990s but said his aim was to create \u201ca not inconsiderable gulf between the mainland and Hong Kong.\u201dThe recent drumbeat of commentaries in the Chinese news media that have sought to shape the historical narrative may have inadvertently strengthened the resolve of many Hong Kong activists, who say such heavy-handed efforts remind them of the political and press freedoms they are fighting for, liberties absent in the rest of China.\u201cI was personally very stunned that Beijing could unabashedly tell lies in the face of so many Hong Kong people, because Hong Kong people can vividly remember the democracy struggle between the former British government and the Chinese government,\u201d said Ming Sing, a political scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The Chinese never made good on their threat to invade, in part because they hoped the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model they eventually adopted for Hong Kong would encourage peaceful reunification with Taiwan, the self-governed island that China claims as its own. China\u2019s leaders also had no interest in disrupting Hong Kong\u2019s wildly successful economy, a vital outlet for foreign trade and hard currency at a time when China was largely isolated from the industrialized world.\u201cWe want to get Hong Kong back in a good state and not in a state of ruin,\u201d is how Mr. Liao put it in the early 1960s.Despite its apparent qualms about democracy on its doorstep, in 1990, China committed to the aim of electing Hong Kong\u2019s leader by universal suffrage after it regained sovereignty. \u201cHow Hong Kong develops democracy in the future is a matter entirely within the sphere of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, and the central government cannot intervene,\u201d People\u2019s Daily quoted Lu Ping as saying in 1993.But in 1997, not long after the handover, China scrapped Mr. Patten\u2019s newly introduced legislative elections. Faced with too much democracy, China simply \u201cset up a new kitchen,\u201d as Mr. Lu had earlier suggested the Chinese might do.Since then, however, direct elections have been restored for 35 representatives, besting Mr. Patten\u2019s system by five seats. (Another 35 members of the Legislative Council are chosen by professional or special interest groups).Beijing argues that its promise to allow Hong Kong residents to elect their leader, the chief executive, by universal suffrage starting in 2017 is more democracy than Britain ever offered.But in August, China issued new rules for the election that would allow a 1,200-member committee, most of them Beijing loyalists, to vet potential candidates.The system may have more elements of democracy than those under British rule, but it falls short of the unfettered self-determination Hong Kong democrats aspire to.\u201cLooking back at history, it seems like the Communist Party made promises it never intended to keep, which is why people are so angry,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University who grew up in Hong Kong during the 1980s and \u201990s.In the end, the skirmishes over history matter little to those who have been occupying the streets of Hong Kong for more than a month.Max Tang, 19, a wedding photographer who was camped in a tent outside government headquarters, was a toddler during the handover.\u201cWhat Hong Kong people did before the handover does not matter,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first chance I have to express my demand for democracy. What we want is very simple. We want to choose our own leader.\u201dAlan Wong contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Didi Kirsten Tatlow from Beijing.

{"Headline": "In Eurozone, Deflation; in U.S., Mild Inflation ", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsDEFLATION has become a reality in many European countries, at least in terms of the prices of goods, as opposed to services. In the United States, prices for goods are still rising, but at a slow rate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this week that prices of goods were 0.4 percent higher in September than they were a year earlier, but that increase was largely due to a surprising increase in food prices \u2014 something that seems unlikely to continue in the face of declines in prices for many agricultural commodities.Over all, the Consumer Price Index in the United States rose 1.7 percent over the last 12 months. That is hardly a high number, and is below the 2 percent target rate used by the Federal Reserve. But as the accompanying charts show, the rate is higher than that of any of the 15 largest countries in the European Union.Of those 15 European countries, prices of goods in 11 were lower in September than a year earlier. Only Germany, Britain, Austria and Finland experienced goods price inflation, and none of those rates were higher than half a percentage point. The reasons for declining prices include weak economies \u2014 some European economies appear to have fallen into new recessions \u2014 and declining import prices brought on in part by weak demand. Over all, the United States reported that import prices for goods were nearly 1 percent lower in September than they had been a year earlier. Imports from China, the largest exporter into the American market, were just a tenth of 1 percent higher.Deflation is less likely in prices for services, in part because it is difficult to reduce nominal wages and in part because overseas competition may be less of a factor. Those prices rose at a rate of 2.5 percent over the last year in the United States and they have shown smaller gains in most European countries, although there were declines in Spain and Greece. Inflation in service prices has offset deflation in the prices of goods, keeping overall inflation above zero in most of the European countries. The charts also show rates of growth in gross domestic product since the third quarter of 2010, just before the United States Federal Reserve embarked on its program of asset purchases that became known as QE2, for quantitative easing.Since then, inflation has been greater in the United States, and economic growth higher, than in much of Europe, but there has been no currency debasement \u2014 the strong dollar has helped to hold down import prices \u2014 and the unemployment rate has fallen by more than 3 percentage points. Over all, the only one of the 15 European countries where G.D.P. grew more than in the United States was Poland. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank resolutely refused to follow the Fed\u2019s lead until after Jean-Claude Trichet retired as president in 2011, and growth has been weak. It appears that the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing did stimulate growth to at least some extent but did not increase inflation.Of the 15 European countries, shown in the charts, only four \u2014 Britain, Denmark and Sweden, as well as Poland \u2014 remained out of the eurozone and thus in control of their own monetary policy. Three of those countries \u2014 Denmark being the exception \u2014 have grown more rapidly than any of the major countries in the eurozone. Five of the eurozone countries \u2014 Finland, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain \u2014 now have smaller economies than they did in 2010.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It Was a Good Summer for the Economy, but the Future Looks Less Bright", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProspects for GrowthIt was quite a strong summer for the American economy. The question now is how it will hold up over the months ahead.That\u2019s the main thing to take away from Thursday\u2019s report on gross domestic product for the third quarter.Overall gross domestic product growth came in at a 3.5 percent annual rate, better than the 3 percent analysts had forecast. It is hardly the strongest result of recent years; that would be the second quarter of this year, with a gaudy 4.6 percent growth rate.But the results look even better if you take out the fluctuations in business inventories that can make G.D.P. bounce around but don\u2019t really send meaningful signals about the underlying trend of growth in the economy. Looking at final sales, a measure of growth that excludes inventory swings, the economy grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the best since the final months of 2010.Some usual caveats apply: These numbers will be revised multiple times as more data become available, and the economy still has a way to go to return to full health. But the July through September period was, from what we know now, making unmistakable progress in that direction.But as always, the G.D.P. report is backward-looking. To see what it tells us about the future, we need to look where the growth is coming from \u2014 and whether it is likely to continue into the future. Here, the evidence is more uneven.Exports rose at a whopping 7.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter, and imports fell, which together meant that net exports added 1.32 percentage points to the quarter\u2019s growth tally, more than a third of the total. That\u2019s good news, of course. When the United States sells more goods to the rest of the world, that makes for more jobs and income for Americans. But exports will face headwinds. With the dollar rising about 8 percent against other major currencies since the end of June, American-made products will cost more in many foreign currencies. Over time, that will make it challenging for American exporters to keep up the kind of breakneck pace of sales growth they experienced in the summer of 2014.Another driver of growth was government spending. The federal government has subtracted from overall G.D.P. for seven straight quarters heading into the July 2014, reflecting spending cuts. That reversed in the third quarter, with the federal government adding 0.67 percentage points to overall growth, and state and local governments chipping in a bit as well.Just Wednesday, the Federal Reserve released a policy statement that deleted language from previous statements which had said \u201cfiscal policy is restraining economic growth,\u201d and it appears they knew whereof they spoke.The disappointing news in the report is that growth was not more robust in the sectors that are most likely to consistently drive future expansion. American consumers increased their spending in the summer, but more slowly than they had in the spring; third-quarter personal consumption expenditures rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate, down from 2.5 percent in the second.And crucial categories of business investment also rose, but not quickly enough to emerge as major drivers of growth.Nonresidential fixed investment, which includes business spending on structures, equipment and intellectual property, rose at a 5.5 percent annual rate.But housing continued its long, depressing run, with residential investment again failing to generate meaningful growth even though it remains far below its historical levels relative to the overall economy. Residential investment rose at a mere 1.8 percent annual rate, good enough to add just 0.06 percentage points to overall growth.The good news is that all of these sectors driving private-sector demand in the domestic economy were positive. The bad news is that they were not as positive as you might expect given the sunny overall growth rate.And that matters because of the overall context in which this report appears.The economy grew quite strongly in the second and third quarter, but not strongly enough to close the gap between actual output and what analysts at the Congressional Budget Office believe the American economy is capable of.By their estimate, if Americans were fully employed and businesses were cranking at full capacity, G.D.P. would have been about $584 billion higher in the third quarter than it actually was (at an annual rate, in 2009 dollars), or about 3.6 percent more activity.There has been meaningful progress on that front; as recently as 2010 that estimated \u201coutput gap\u201d surpassed $1 trillion. But it still suggests there is a great deal of untapped potential in the economy. And unless private sources of demand start growing faster than they did in the summer, it may not close anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mixed Economic Signals From China", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Markets around the world have been jolted by fears that slowing growth and deflationary pressures in Europe, Japan and other major economies could derail the United States. But the health of China, for decades an engine of growth, has emerged as one of the most significant wild cards in the global economy.It is hard to be certain just exactly how the Chinese economy is faring, given mixed signals in the data.Chinese inflation is at its weakest levels in nearly five years. Commodity prices are plunging. New home sales are declining. Foreign investment is contracting.The overall economy, though, continues to chug along at a steady, albeit more modest, pace. China\u2019s gross domestic product increased by 7.3 percent in the third quarter, compared with 7.5 percent in the previous quarter. While that was the lowest quarterly growth since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, the rate remains the envy of major economies. The economy also continues adding jobs at a good clip, and the currency is one of very few that are still rising against the dollar. \u201cThe question or problem we are all facing at the moment is, \u2018What is right picture for the economy as a whole?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Louis Kuijs, the chief China economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated by negative forces that show up very strongly in industry but not in the service sector.\u201dMaking sense of China\u2019s economic health is challenging because the slowdown is partly by design.The Communist leadership has pledged to reduce China\u2019s dependence on credit-fueled growth and investment, to instead emphasize domestic consumption. It is a risky proposal, and leaders have signaled a willingness to live with slower growth, provided employment holds up and systemic risks are contained.One figure that Chinese leaders study closely is the number of new jobs. Li Keqiang, China\u2019s prime minister, boasted in a speech at a World Economic Forum meeting last month that nearly 10 million urban jobs had been created in the first eight months of the year, up slightly from a year ago. As a result, he said, he would not mind if the growth of the gross domestic product fell short of this year\u2019s official target of 7.5 percent.\u201cAn important goal of maintaining stable growth is to ensure employment, and the floor of the proper range is to ensure relatively adequate employment,\u201d he said at the meeting in Tianjin.But even in the jobs figures, broad disparities exist across China. Employment has grown solidly in the services sector nearly every month in the last five years, according to the purchasing managers index compiled by HSBC and Markit. By contrast, manufacturing employment, which generally expanded from 2009 through 2011, has mostly contracted since.At an employment fair for the medical appliance industry at a government-run career center near the Lama Temple in Beijing last week, more than a hundred job seekers bantered with recruiters and weighed their options. A 42-year-old man who gave only his surname, Mr. Lin, was applying for a job at Beijing Niubao Technology, a chemical equipment maker.With 20 years of experience in a specialized industry, Mr. Lin expressed confidence about his prospects despite the overall outlook in the sector. \u201cManufacturing isn\u2019t doing so great in the past few years, but I think chemical equipment is still doing relatively O.K.,\u201d he said.That somewhat positive outlook is a sharp contrast to most traditional industries. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any new recruits this year,\u201d Huang Xinqun, 48, a manager at a large ocean-shipping company, said last week. \u201cUsually when the manufacturing business is not doing so well, it would be directly reflected on us,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re like a signal post on how the economy is doing,\u201d Mr. Huang said. \u201cIf companies don\u2019t have that many orders and products to transport, then we don\u2019t have as much work.\u201dDespite the signs of malaise in China\u2019s manufacturing and industrial sectors, the government is wary of repeating the significant stimulus measures it undertook after the financial crisis. Leaders are worried that would add to China\u2019s ballooning debt, which rose to 250 percent of gross domestic product at the end of June, from 150 percent five years ago, according to estimates by Standard Chartered Bank.Instead, policy makers in recent months have used targeted, behind-the-scenes stimulus measures, including extending limited amounts of short-term credit to large and medium-size banks. The government also has directed more financing to favored projects, like supporting agricultural efforts and redeveloping shantytowns.\u201cThings can be done to bolster activity for short periods of time, but I think the fundamental theme is a persistent ratcheting down in the measured rate of growth,\u201d said George Magnus, a financial consultant and a former chief economist at UBS. \u201cChina is in for an extended period of volatility.\u201dOther major indicators offer similarly contradictory perspectives on the progress of China\u2019s economic transition.Retail sales are rising at their slowest pace in nearly a decade, seemingly casting doubt on the ability of Chinese consumers to drive economic growth. But with an increase of about 12 percent in value this year, sales are hardly anemic.What is more, official sales figures fail to capture the explosive growth of online shopping in China. The statistics bureau only began including the sales of some unnamed, large Internet retailers in its data this year. But Mark Williams, the chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, estimates that official retail sales figures only capture about one-sixth of the online purchases in China.Trade figures, too, are somewhat unclear. Reported Chinese exports rose 15.3 percent last month, their biggest increase since 2013. But that was partly because of a 34 percent increase in exports to Hong Kong.The most problematic economic indicator in China may be gross domestic product itself. Though economists say the data broadly are improving, the numbers do not always seem to add up. For example, the combined G.D.P. reported by each of China\u2019s provinces still regularly exceeds the official total for the country.Even Mr. Li, the prime minister, has at times expressed doubts over this benchmark measure of output. In 2007, when he was governor of Liaoning Province in northeastern China, Mr. Li privately acknowledged to a visiting American diplomat that China\u2019s G.D.P. figures were unreliable and \u201cfor reference only\u201d because they were \u201cman-made,\u201d according to a confidential diplomatic cable released in 2010 by WikiLeaks.Since then, many economists have supplemented China\u2019s official figures with their own versions of a \u201cLi Keqiang Index,\u201d alternative measures based on what Mr. Li said were his bellwethers of economic expansion. They include electricity consumption, rail cargo volumes and the value of loans disbursed.\u201cCertainly these data have the potential to be more reliable but there are complications there, too,\u201d said Carsten Holz, a professor of social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology who has scrutinized China\u2019s economic data.\u201cIt\u2019s a planned economy thing,\u201d Mr. Holz said of the Li Keqiang indexes, likening them to tallying apples on a tree but making no attempt to calculate their value.\u201cIt is a very rudimentary measure, because you don\u2019t know how many of these apples are rotten, or measure how big they are,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are just counting apples.\u201dChen Jiehao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

It weighs in at a lean 1,962 pounds, and slides through the air with a body contoured with a slippery 0.258 drag coefficient. The Ducati engine provides a top speed of 168 m.p.h. in this configuration. But VW said its zero-to-62 m.p.h. acceleration takes 5.7 seconds \u2014 a less-than-impressive figure when compared to the superquick Superleggera. (Granted, the Superleggera weighs a mere 342 pounds.)The XL Sport, a few inches larger than the XL1 in most dimensions, features a racing-derived chassis with high-strength steel subframes. The body is hand-built from carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and resins. The monocoque body allows offset seating for two.Though clearly meant for performance activities, VW said the XL Sport also featured a trunk with 3.8 cubic feet of luggage space. The side windows are fixed in place, a weight-saving consideration to eliminate the need for an apparatus to open and close them. The oversize doors open upward, gull-wing fashion.Although billed as a concept, Volkswagen announced its commitment to build 500 XL Sports and offer them for sale to the public.

Nobody!\u201dHe was unspooling one of his favorite tales: his quest to shake this Rust Belt city out of decades of economic decline.On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo will have another opportunity to showcase his work, when he and three of his challengers meet at the PBS station here, WNED-TV, for the first and likely only debate in the race for governor this year.Local officials, accustomed to indifference from Albany, gush. At a Cuomo campaign rally last month, Mayor Byron W. Brown introduced him as \u201cthe greatest governor that the state of New York has ever had.\u201dBuffalo residents have heard their share of bullish promises over the years, only to wind up sorely disappointed. Some critics see political motivations behind Mr. Cuomo\u2019s interest. After all, he lost most of western New York when he ran in 2010, though he won in Buffalo, which is overwhelmingly Democratic.\u201cWe were really the only region of the state to fundamentally reject his candidacy,\u201d said Nicholas A. Langworthy, the Republican Party chairman in Erie County. \u201cI think that\u2019s what drives his intention of spending as much time and tax money as possible here.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s Republican opponent in 2010 was Carl P. Paladino, a Buffalo developer, who predicted the governor\u2019s interest would not last. \u201cThe day after the election, he\u2019ll forget about western New York,\u201d Mr. Paladino said in an interview.Mr. Cuomo has done little to dispute the notion that he is trying to make up for his weak showing in 2010: Last week, his campaign released a commercial featuring Thurman Thomas, the Hall of Fame running back for the Bills, who had supported Mr. Paladino.But Mr. Cuomo says his fixation is not about winning votes. \u201cIt\u2019s a cheap political analysis by a really cynical individual,\u201d he said. \u201cBuffalo had the highest need in the state.\u201dBuffalo has long confounded New York\u2019s political leaders. As factories closed, its population fell by more than half to about 260,000 last year, from 580,000 in 1950. Big promises to re-energize the city, like a plan for an outdoor-sports superstore along the waterfront, have failed to materialize.Mr. Cuomo offered his own big plan in 2012: a \u201cBuffalo Billion\u201d to fund economic development. His office said most of the money had been earmarked for different projects but only $392 million had been formally awarded by the state.The governor said the point was less as an infusion of money than as a marketing device with \u201cshock value,\u201d which could be replicated in other upstate cities.\u201cIf you can bring back Buffalo, in truth, you can bring back Syracuse, you can bring back Rochester, you can bring back Utica,\u201d he said.To some extent, Buffalo has stood in for the rest of upstate New York for Mr. Cuomo, who was born in Queens and lives in Westchester County, but has tried to be solicitous of regions north of the New York metropolitan area.\u201cIf we have a governor who recognizes that New York State is more than just New York City, I\u2019m happy about that,\u201d said Joseph C. Lorigo, a registered Conservative who is the majority leader in the Erie County Legislature.When the deal was announced, Mr. Cuomo said it was \u201cbigger than anything we could have imagined.\u201dThe SolarCity project has drawn scrutiny because of the size of the public investment, which the state says would produce 3,000 local jobs. Robert Weber, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the rating agency, warned that it was uncertain whether a relatively new industry like green energy \u201ccan be a long-term stabilizing factor for the city.\u201dIt will take years to assess the effects of the projects Mr. Cuomo has championed \u2014 if they pan out.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Republican opponent, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, has accused Mr. Cuomo of \u201cjust throwing around tax dollars\u201d in a futile effort to improve an economy stifled by high taxes.And Mr. Paladino, his erstwhile opponent, said Mr. Cuomo was effectively buying jobs with taxpayer money so he could issue news releases bragging about them. He added that people in Buffalo were overly susceptible to optimistic promises: \u201cYou just tell them, \u2018Hey, I got a lollipop for you,\u2019 and their eyes get bright, and they get all crazed.\u201dThe long-term challenge is steep. Some 51 percent of children in Buffalo were living in poverty in 2013, according to census data. Among the nation\u2019s largest cities, only Cleveland and Detroit had a higher rate.Away from downtown, in neighborhoods battling crime and unemployment, residents have sensed little change, said Betty Jean Grant, a Democrat who is the minority leader of the Erie County Legislature.\u201cPeople were talking about a billion dollars for Buffalo, but it wasn\u2019t the Buffalo that they knew and lived in,\u201d she said.Mr. Cuomo is promising to focus more attention on neighborhoods like the East Side. \u201cWhen you have 50 percent of the children in poverty, that\u2019s not a success,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil that\u2019s remedied, you can\u2019t claim success.\u201dStill, the governor\u2019s visit to the True Bethel Baptist Church revealed some of the fruits of his motivational efforts. The pastor, the Rev. Darius G. Pridgen, who is also the president of the Buffalo Common Council, asked congregants to think about past governors and how little they had done for the city, and about the money now \u201crolling in\u201d from state government.\u201cNobody was running to buy houses in downtown Buffalo,\u201d he said. \u201cNow every place you look, if they can fit a bedroom in it, it\u2019s becoming a loft.\u201dOutside, Renita Salim, who works at a Walmart, said she appreciated Mr. Cuomo\u2019s attention. \u201cWe\u2019ve totally been overlooked,\u201d she said, \u201cand he\u2019s brought life back to us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can You Uber a Burger?", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyIn the spring of 2009, when New York was consumed by a frenzy for extravagant hamburgers, one of the most coveted was the $26 Black Label burger, perhaps smeared with a dab of bone marrow, at the recently revamped Minetta\u00ad Tavern in Greenwich Village. For most civilians, their best hope of devouring one of these funky, dry-aged meat pucks was to arrive promptly at 5:30 p.m. and wait \u2014 perhaps for hours, as I once did \u2014 until a table opened. For the select few, however, there was a shortcut. Keith McNally, the restaurant\u2019s proprietor, has long maintained a private reservation line for esteemed regulars and V.I.P.s, who were ranked in their worthiness from A to AAA. For them, a $26 burger \u2014 and a table for two at 7:30 p.m. at which to engorge it \u2014 was only a phone call away.Today, anyone can get a prime-time table at Minetta, at least for a certain price. In recent months, as retail rents have risen in cities like New York and San Francisco, and as food prices have simultaneously hit three-year highs, various companies have been trying to find new ways to monetize the restaurant experience. Inspired by how we pay for concerts, airline tickets and, more recently, transportation through the car-hailing service Uber, more and more apps and reservation systems have homed in on disrupting a fundamental ritual: how we book a table. Table 8 in San Francisco sells reservations at popular restaurants just days in advance; Zurvu scours the best open tables on OpenTable; Reserve, a start-up created by founders of Uber and Foursquare, aims to be a full-fledged digital concierge; SeatMe, which was acquired by Yelp, allows restaurants to ping eager diners if tables open up at the last minute. \u201cThis is a space that hasn\u2019t seen a lot of innovation since 1998,\u201d which is \u201cwhen OpenTable first started taking online reservations,\u201d says Brian Mayer, the founder of ReservationHop, yet another new reservation-\u00adselling service. This summer, McNally\u2019s restaurant group teamed up with Resy, a service that sells reservations for tables at peak times. Now, anyone hankering for a Black Label burger can pay $20 for a table at 7:30 p.m.These services are, of course, cheaper and more efficient than a human reservationist; they can also give restaurants access to more intimate portraits of their diners, and they can match customers to tables algorithmically. Mainly, though, they are solving an old economic problem. They allow restaurants to better mitigate the risk that they will lose money on a diner who promises to show up and cancels. (Throughout the industry, no-shows make up 5 to 10 percent of all reservations.) If a customer fails to show up, says Al Roth, a professor of economics at Stanford University, the opportunity to monetize that slot is gone forever.Nick Kokonas, a former derivatives trader who is an owner of the exclusive Chicago restaurants Next and Alinea, has found perhaps the most clever way to solve this problem. Kokonas has developed a system that requires diners to pay for a ticket to reserve their spot, with that money deducted from their final bill. While he has employed a version of the system for his expensive tasting menus, he expects tickets at more casual restaurants to take the form \u201cof a deposit ticket of $5 to $10, fully applied to the bill.\u201d According to Kokonas, restaurants using pilot versions of his system have seen no-show rates drop to less than 2 percent.This sort of system, says Jeff Ely, a professor of economics at Northwestern University and a director of the Center for Economic Theory, effectively shifts \u201cthe risk from the restaurant to the party. . . . I\u2019m only going to make the reservation if I really want to go.\u201d More fundamentally, these new services are engendering a shift in the way people think about what they\u2019re buying at a restaurant. Normally, \u201cwhen you dine at a restaurant, you\u2019re getting two things: a table and the food,\u201d Ely says. But by paying for a reservation separately, \u201cyou\u2019re unbundling them.\u201d And this unbundling reveals that, at least from a market perspective, some reservations are more valuable than others. \u201cThere\u2019s scarce inventory,\u201d says Ben Leventhal, a founder of Resy, and \u201ceverybody wants to eat at 8.\u201d Resy, which splits the fee from each reservation with the restaurants, allows its clients to put a premium on prime-time seats while gently pushing cost-conscious customers to time slots they have more trouble filling. In Kokonas\u2019s system, ticket prices can also rise and fall depending on market demand, varying by the hour, day or even season.David Chang, whose popular Momofuku restaurants use a famously unbending online reservation system, told me that he\u2019d been fascinated with the idea for years. \u201cCharging a premium for premium hours is something I really wanted to do, but the timing wasn\u2019t right,\u201d he says. Now, he notes, \u201cdining has much more of an entertainment value.\u201d He compared it to a Broadway show. \u201cYou pay less for a matinee and balcony seats, and you pay more for front row.\u201d Perhaps more significant, apps like Uber and Lyft have introduced millions of users to the convenience of access at the swipe of a screen. And they seem willing to pay along a sliding scale for it.But because restaurants have been slow to capitalize on that demand, a number of services have emerged to book reservations without a restaurant\u2019s knowledge and sell them to diners, while cutting the restaurant entirely out of the transaction. Sophie McNally, the operations manager of her father\u2019s restaurants, described these services as \u201cbasically scalpers.\u201d Some, like Today\u2019s Epicure, frame themselves as a concierge service, charging a large annual fee. Killer Rezzy, which charges its 6,103 members $25 per reservation, books tables at 78 restaurants \u2014 a sizable fraction of which have teamed up with the service. Killer Rezzy tries to lure restaurants, however, through revenues from the reservations it sells and access to the profiles of its members, enabling them to better target potential diners. Sasha Tcherevkoff, its founder, said that roughly 40 percent of the restaurants that initially asked him to remove their reservations from his site ultimately either signed on for a trial or became partners.The restaurant business, after all, is unrelenting, with most owners seeing profit margins of just 3 to 5 percent. And while the financial impact of charging for reservations or ticketing diners may seem minimal, \u201cthe ability to generate additional sales by using a host of different levers to ensure demand makes the operation viable,\u201d says Hudson Riehle, a senior vice president for research at the National Restaurant Association. But consumers who like picking up the phone \u2014 or simply don\u2019t want pay extra \u2014 don\u2019t have to fear. According to Ely, even though ticketing or demand-based reservation platforms \u201cwill be the norm in a segment of the market,\u201d there will always be upscale restaurants that make it their identity to do things the old-fashioned way. Chang, as fascinated as he is by the concept of premium pricing, says that \u201cit\u2019s not something in the spirit of who we are.\u201dStill, there may be little escape from the logic that is ultimately driving these restaurants to use technology more efficiently. Kokonas, Leventhal and Tcherevkoff all have much larger plans for their services as logistics with a broad range of applications. \u201cNonemergency medicine, spas, your personal trainer,\u201d Kokonas says. \u201cAnything that\u2019s a time-slotted business.\u201d Have your tickets ready.Matt Buchanan is co-editor of The Awl, a digital magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hong Kong, Britain and Democracy", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersRe \u201cChina began push against Hong Kong vote in \u201950s\u201d (Oct. 28): While it might be true that China opposed the introduction of democracy in Hong Kong by Britain as early as the 1950s, Beijing wasn\u2019t against democracy per se, but it was concerned that democratization might bring independence.The regular decolonization process \u2014 introducing representative government leading to independence \u2014 would not have been tolerated in Hong Kong by Beijing. From day one, China had never accepted that Hong Kong was a colony. In 1972, for example, Hong Kong was removed from the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories (colonies) at the request of China. Introducing democracy in Hong Kong, still administrated by the British, would have led to one very likely outcome: independence. This would have never been acceptable to China, whether ruled by the Communists or the Nationalists.As for the much belated effort by the British to push for a taste of democracy after it had run out of any options other than to give up Hong Kong, the late John Walden, a former director of home affairs in the colonial government, called it a \u201cgrand illusion.\u201dIn a speech in 1985, Mr. Walden said: \u201cIf I personally find it difficult to believe in the sincerity of this sudden and unexpected official enthusiasm for democratic politics it is because throughout the 30 years I was an official myself, from 1951 to 1981, \u2018democracy\u2019 was a dirty word. Officials were convinced that the introduction of democratic politics into Hong Kong would be the quickest and surest way to ruin Hong Kong\u2019s economy and create social and political instability.\u201dRe \u201cPutin and the pope\u201d (Oct. 23): Will the demonization of President Vladimir Putin of Russia never end? Thomas Friedman maintains the diatribe. He notes rightly that the expansion of NATO when Russia was weak left a sour legacy in the minds of Russians, but calling the notion that possible NATO expansion threatens Russia a \u201clie\u201d shows that his stance is very much part of the current problem.An ever-expanding NATO poised to take over the naval base in Sevastopol would present a very real threat to Russia, especially after the new government in Ukraine said it wanted to join the Atlantic alliance soon after its coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against a legitimately elected president. That same government abolished \u2014 almost as its first act \u2014 the recently won language rights of Russian, Tatar, Hungarian and Romanian speakers in Ukraine, and formed a coalition with Svoboda, a party that as recently as 2012 was characterized as \u201cracist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic,\u201d by the European Parliament, and labeled \u201cneo-Nazi\u201d by the World Jewish Congress in 2013.Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine exploded in fury without any need for encouragement from Mr. Putin.The reality is that all countries will do what they can to protect themselves from real or perceived threats to their national security. Re \u201cHistory without Hitler\u201d (Opinion, Oct. 27): Timothy Ryback suggests that had Hitler died during World War I, history might have been very different. This may well be. However, Mr. Ryback makes no mention of the punishing war reparations that were imposed on Germany by the Allies after World War I. These reparations were a major factor in the German political instability during the 1920s that ultimately resulted in the demise of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Hitler.It is arguable that had Hitler died during World War I, these conditions in postwar Germany could well have resulted in the rise of a different dictator and another war.After World War II, the Allies took the lessons of World War I to heart, and concluded a peace that was much more generous toward the defeated Germans, Italians and Japanese, that made that peace much more durable than the peace that ended World War I.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jean-Claude Duvalier Dies at 63; Ruled Haiti in Father\u2019s Brutal Fashion", "Date": "2014-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJean-Claude Duvalier, the former president of Haiti who was known as Baby Doc, returned from a 25-year exile in 2011.Though generally viewed as less harsh than his father, he never apologized for atrocities, including brutal crackdowns on opponents at the hands of the feared Tonton Macoutes, a civilian militia that left a thousand people, if not more, dead, disappeared or illegally detained.Indeed, he defended himself as victims of his government pursued cases in Haitian courts on charges of corruption and human rights abuses. Mr. Duvalier appeared in court and calmly denied any wrongdoing, and even asserted that the country was better off when he ruled. \u201cDeaths exist in all countries,\u201d Mr. Duvalier replied almost inaudibly. \u201cI didn\u2019t intervene in the activities of the police.\u201dHe dined regularly at restaurants in Port-au-Prince, Haiti\u2019s capital, and attended events at the invitation of Mr. Martelly, whose administration has included relatives and allies of people associated with Mr. Duvalier. A brief statement released by Mr. Martelly\u2019s office said he learned of Mr. Duvalier\u2019s death \u201cwith great sadness\u201d and made no mention of the former president\u2019s iron-fisted rule. \u201cOn behalf of the entire government and people of Haiti, I take this sad occasion to extend my sincere sympathies to his family, his relatives and his supporters across the country,\u201d Mr. Martelly said.Richard Sassine, a close friend of Mr. Duvalier, told The Miami Herald that Mr. Duvalier had been writing a memoir that would correct misunderstandings about him and his tenure.\u201cHe was a gentle giant,\u201d Mr. Sassine said. \u201cNot this tyrant.\u201dThis year, his old political party announced that it would field candidates in elections, and opened an office, though analysts were not sure if it was a serious move or a thumb in the eye of the rival he loathed, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, another formerly exiled president who also returned and still is a political force.Mr. Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986, as political repression and a worsening economy set off violent unrest in the hemisphere\u2019s poorest country. He asked France for asylum and the United States for the plane to take him there, an American official said at the time.His departure set the stage for democratic, though tumultuous, elections four years later that lifted Mr. Aristide, a former priest to the poor, to power. (Years later, he, too, was chased from the country by political upheaval.) Human rights groups have said that Mr. Duvalier looted Haiti\u2019s treasury of millions of dollars and largely lived off ill-gotten gains.His presence in the country, and the fact that he will now escape trial, appalled victims and human rights workers who worked to bring him to justice.Still, a majority of the population now was born after his departure, perhaps dampening passions for or against him.\u201cHe managed with the complicity of foreign powers and domestic politicians to avoid facing justice both when he was in France and when he returned to Haiti in 2011,\u201d said Robert Fatton Jr., a University of Virginia professor and the author of \u201cHaiti: Trapped in the Outer Periphery.\u201d \u201cBecause he escaped trial, the extent of his crimes and looting will not be fully documented.\u201dMr. Duvalier was born July 3, 1951, in Port-au-Prince. Biographical sketches published when he became president described him as an introvert who liked fast cars and jazz, and a martial arts enthusiast. He spoke Spanish and French, and attended classes at the University of Haiti, though diplomats whispered that he was unprepared for office, and speculated that his father\u2019s ministers would hold the real power.Mr. Duvalier rarely granted interviews and kept public appearances to a minimum, but details of lavish spending on art, clothing and a wedding believed to have cost $5 million trickled out of the presidential palace.Whether of his own volition or at the urging of others, Mr. Duvalier took obvious cues from his father, and while occasionally releasing political prisoners or tolerating critical news coverage, he quickly quashed serious dissent.He curried favor with the United States, and exploited its Cold War aims to ensure that Haiti did not fall under Cuba\u2019s sway by bargaining for aid, though his government did not receive all that it believed it needed.Still, investment increased and he pushed urbanization and public works projects, drawing poor farmers from the countryside to such an extent that some argue that agriculture fell into an irreversible decline. The large Haitian diaspora blossomed as people fled and sent money home, buttressing the weak economy. He welcomed nongovernment organizations to fill in what his government could not or would not do, leading to a heavy presence that still exists today.\u201cThe years of Jean-Claude Duvalier were also the time of a ramping up of the current highly fragmented landscape of aid delivery in Haiti,\u201d said Laurent Dubois, an expert on modern Haitian history at Duke University.\u201cJean-Claude Duvalier inherited a carefully constructed state apparatus for political repression from his father, and he largely maintained it during his regime,\u201d Mr. Dubois said.\u201cBut he also cultivated new connections with the U.S., seeking new types of investment in the country,\u201d he added. \u201cThe model of using small manufacturing to expand the economy \u2014 some talked of Haiti becoming the \u2018Taiwan of the Caribbean\u2019 \u2014 was a key part of his economic policy, though even he later admitted that its ultimate success in alleviating poverty was quite limited.\u201dAs political oppression mounted, so did stories of his extravagances. When he fled Haiti, American officials said he held $200 million to $500 million in foreign bank accounts and had a reputation for giving family members million-dollar vacations at luxury resorts, as millions of Haitians lived in squalor and scrounged for food.He looked frail and far thinner than the 250 pounds he once carried on his six-foot frame, and with occasional trips to the hospital, Haitian media speculated that he had returned home to die.Mr. Duvalier is survived by his companion, Veronique Roy, and a son and daughter from his first marriage, Fran\u00e7ois Nicolas and Anya.Damien Cave contributed reporting from Mexico City, and Emma G.

{"Headline": "With Farms Fading and Urban Might Rising, Power Shifts in Iowa", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStates in PlayLAURENS, Iowa \u2014 Pocahontas is running out of students. Public school enrollment in this corn-blanketed county in northern Iowa has plummeted 32 percent over the past decade as the population steadily shrinks. Schools have merged, classes have combined, and sports teams have consolidated, wiping out generations of tradition and rivalry.As Joe Kramer, a school superintendent in the county, sifted through the cruel math of his latest casualty (a girls\u2019 varsity basketball program), he wore the weary look of an overbooked funeral director.\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle for a community to make decisions like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much a part of our identity.\u201dTwo hours south, Dallas County faces a very different problem: It is running out of schools. With the population swelling, in what used to be farmland ringing Des Moines, enrollment in its largest district has doubled over the same 10 years. As soon as a gleaming new high school is completed, construction on another begins.The hard conversations here, said Dave J. Wilkerson, the local superintendent, are telling parents that their children\u2019s schools have become overcrowded.\u201cI apologize that we will have to send your children off to a new, state-of-the-art school,\u201d he said. \u201cI would rather be dealing with this challenge than with what Pocahontas has.\u201dIowa, the quintessence of heartland America, is undergoing an economic transformation that is challenging its rural character \u2014 and, inevitably, its political order.As Iowans prepare to elect a new United States senator for the first time in three decades, the scale at which people and power have shifted from its rural towns to its urban areas is emerging as a potent but unpredictable undercurrent in the excruciatingly close race, offering opportunity and risk for both sides.The state\u2019s once ubiquitous farms are supporting fewer workers, the towns built around them are hemorrhaging younger residents, and a way of life eroding for decades is approaching a denouement. Farm fields are yielding to the new headquarters of banks, insurance companies and health care providers, whose rapid expansion is luring waves of Iowans to cities and suburbs, and contributing to the state\u2019s enviable 4.5\u2009percent unemployment rate.In jarring and telling tableaus, new housing subdivisions, with names like Stone Prairie and Walnut Creek Estates, are rising up in the Republican precincts west of Des Moines and downtown office buildings in the Democratic-leaning state capital are being remade into loft-style apartments. When researchers at Iowa State University studied population trends between 2000 and 2013, they found that the state\u2019s metropolitan areas had grown by 13.3 percent. The population of communities outside those urban areas fell by 3.6 percent, a gap that far outstrips the rest of the Midwest.Those changes have turned Iowa\u2019s older, Republican precincts even redder and its younger, Democratic districts even bluer, while giving rise to suburbs whose politics can be harder to categorize \u2014 a mixture of millennial generation religious conservatives, baby boomer libertarians and Generation X liberals.Such places \u201care not red state or a blue state. There are a lot of pastels in there,\u201d said David A. Yepsen, the director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University and former political writer for The Des Moines Register.The Republican Senate nominee, Joni Ernst, who is trying to become Iowa\u2019s first woman elected to Congress, has appealed to conservative rural voters, portraying herself as a hog-castrating, gun-firing daughter of Iowa\u2019s agricultural roots. The Democrat, Bruce Braley, a fourth-term representative, has embraced a more urban-friendly agenda, speaking out forcefully on climate change, advocating a higher minimum wage and backing same-sex marriage, which the Iowa Supreme Court legalized in 2009. In the campaign\u2019s highest-profile blunder, Mr. Braley was caught on tape belittling Iowa\u2019s senior senator, Charles E. Grassley, a Republican who would become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee if his party won the majority, as \u201ca farmer from Iowa who never went to law school.\u201d He later apologized.The potency of that urban-rural divide was captured in a Des Moines Register poll in September. It showed that Ms. Ernst had built a nearly 4-to-1 advantage over Mr. Braley among rural voters, which Ms. Ernst underscored in a debate by questioning whether Mr. Braley had forsworn his rural roots.Mr. Braley shot back: \u201cI have not forgotten my rural values.\u201dNo matter what the outcome, it is clear that Iowa, eternally satirized for monochromatic, pitchfork simplicity in \u201cAmerican Gothic,\u201d is a swing state grappling with changes that defy long-held assumptions. Its farmers are emerging as leaders in sustainable energy, its rural towns are becoming magnets for Latinos, and its cities laboratories for high-tech start-ups.Senator Tom Harkin, the Democrat whose retirement sparked this year\u2019s race, said the election would turn on which candidate acknowledged the new landscape.\u201cThere is this ideal of Iowa,\u201d he said. Those who have left its farmlands \u201caren\u2019t too far removed from those small towns.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cthey know they are not going back there.\u201dRural CollapseJohn Stumpf is not going back.A generation ago, Treasure Chest, the consignment business his grandmother operates on the forlorn retail strip in Laurens, in western Pocahontas County, would have passed unthinkingly into his hands. Now business is agonizingly slow, and Mr. Stumpf, a 21-year-old film major at the University of Iowa, said small-town living ill suited him.\u201cThere is nothing for me here,\u201d he said, sitting in the store\u2019s stockroom as his grandmother, Millie Burnham, nodded in reluctant agreement.An air of diminishment, of something slipping away, surrounds them.\u201cEverything is closing,\u201d she said.\u201cSchool will, eventually,\u201d he said.Laurens, which flirted with a population of 1,800 in the 1960s, was down to 1,476 in 2000, then 1,258 in 2010. The story is similar across Iowa: Once-vibrant communities have been shattered in two waves, first by the farm crisis of the 1980s, then by technological improvements that encouraged far bigger farms and required far fewer farmers.As of 2011, Pocahontas\u2019s farming industry employed 764 people, about half as many as in 1980.Those who stay are largely Republican. Susie Mayou, a 55-year-old conservative, described herself as heartsick that Democrats had carried Iowa in six of the last seven presidential elections. \u201cIf Iowa gave power based on land ownership, the state would swing 180 degrees,\u201d she said. \u201cThe city people push the agenda.\u201dThat now includes people like the city-bound Mr. Stumpf. Despite his grandmother\u2019s Republicanism, he plans to vote for Mr. Braley, quoting from his campaign commercial attacking Ms. Ernst for opposing a federal minimum wage.Downtown RevivalIt is known as Silicon Sixth: a stretch of Sixth Avenue in downtown Des Moines that houses about two dozen technology start-ups. A few blocks over, the Des Moines Building, an old office building, is undergoing a makeover into a 136-unit apartment building, complete with a dog-walking terrace. Up the street, the downtown\u2019s first full-service supermarket is under development.The once sleepy core of Des Moines, known for its commuter-friendly 9-to-5 hours and drab overhead skywalk system, is taking on cosmopolitan hues. The population downtown has doubled over the past decade, and 1,500 new units of housing are planned.As a result, Des Moines\u2019s home, Polk County \u2014 where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 20,000 and President Obama\u2019s margin of victory widened between 2008 and 2012 \u2014 is growing even more influential in statewide politics.Mickey Davis, a 23-year-old musician, was so confident he would leave Iowa after college that on his arm he tattooed the corporate emblem of Travelers Insurance Company, a mainstay of downtown Des Moines, to take a bit of the state with him.He is now the program manager at the Des Moines Social Club, a hive of cultural activity inside the Art Deco quarters of an erstwhile firehouse, which hosts operas, poetry readings, bands, art exhibits and yoga classes.\u201cDes Moines,\u201d he said over lunch, \u201cis actually a happening place.\u201dHispanic GrowthCity Councilman Pete Rodriguez navigated his white Toyota sedan down Main Street, jabbing his finger at the passing houses.\u201cHispanics live there,\u201d he said of a white ranch. \u201cThat\u2019s a Hispanic house,\u201d he said of a beige Victorian. The phrase echoed like a soundtrack. Hispanic house. Hispanic house. Hispanic house.Iowa, with its 92 percent white population, remains a place where diversity seems oxymoronic, \u201cso white that you almost need special glasses to pick the people out from the snow banks,\u201d Wade Rathke, the founder of Acorn, the social activist group, wrote in 2008.But in the city of Denison, in far western Iowa, decades of stereotypes are falling away, revealing corners of the state where Latino immigrants are remaking the landscape. Here, where meatpacking plants crave low-wage workers, Hispanics make up 42 percent of the population, more than twice as much as a decade ago.These migrant towns now pepper the state: West Liberty, Storm Lake, Muscatine and Marshalltown. State data shows that the 168,000 Latinos in Iowa are now its largest minority, 6 percent of the population, and the figure is expected to surge because Latinos are significantly younger than their white neighbors and have far higher birthrates.The Denison school system is now recruiting Spanish-language teachers. The Walmart Supercenter has dedicated an aisle to \u201cHispanic food.\u201d The City Council has its first Latino member, Mr. Rodriguez.But for now, the power of the Latino vote is more potential than reality.The Latinos of Denison have a dismal record of casting ballots. Not long ago, the mayor, Brad Bonner, cracked open a binder containing the city\u2019s voting rolls in search of Hispanic names. \u201cThere were 12 of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t vote.\u201dPatricia Ritchie, a community activist, chose a coffee shop in the city\u2019s quaint downtown to explain why. Inside, Denison\u2019s aging power brokers \u2014 about 15 bankers, lawyers and farmers \u2014 held their weekly breakfast meeting over slices of egg, sausage and Velveeta casserole.They were all white.\u201cSee?\u201d asked Ms. Ritchie, a 41-year-old Hispanic and an Army veteran.Hispanics in Denison, she said, \u201care afraid of the white power structure.\u201dThose who have participated in the past have not always been heartened by the results. Vicenta Cardenas, 43, who crossed into the United States illegally from Mexico but is now a citizen, registered to vote in time for the 2008 general election, casting a ballot for Mr. Obama. She did the same in 2012. They were votes, she believed, to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants.Amnesty has not come. \u201cPersonally, I feel Obama tricked Latinos,\u201d she said, sitting at her kitchen table.Asked if she intended to vote this year, Ms. Cardenas shrugged.Conflicted FarmersThe campaign commercial opens with a rural tableau of windmills and rows of soybeans. \u201cI grew up walking beans on our family farm,\u201d Ms. Ernst says. The ad concludes with an appeal to Iowa\u2019s of-the-land pride, suggesting the triumph of entrepreneurial farmers over the bureaucracy of Washington. \u201cI\u2019ll take our values there,\u201d she says of the Senate.But Iowa\u2019s rural values, conflicted by farmers\u2019 deepening reliance on government and colored by a growing investment in the green economy, are no longer reflexively Republican.The crosscurrents are on display at Campbell Grain Farms in Clinton County, near Iowa\u2019s eastern border. Its owner, Dennis Campbell, a sixth-generation soybean and corn farmer, acknowledges that he is a walking contradiction: both a victim of an overreaching federal government and a poster child for the benefits of federal intervention.He walked up to a gas tank on his property, a totem, he said, of federal rules run amok. To cut down on fuel deliveries \u2014 reducing costs and carbon emissions \u2014 he bought a 10,000-gallon behemoth. But for one that size, the government mandates a double-walled model, to prevent leaks. That cost him tens of thousands of dollars extra, an expense avoided by neighboring farmers who stick with tanks that are smaller, older and riskier. \u201cI\u2019m being penalized by the government,\u201d he said.But a few feet away, he showed off a wall of 256 solar panels on the roof of his shed that will generate enough electricity to power his farm. It is a money-saving technology whose economics, he conceded, work only because of some $80,000 worth of tax credits from the same federal government that insisted he buy the pricier gas tank.\u201cI am talking out of both sides of my mouth,\u201d said Mr. Campbell, who intends to support Ms. Ernst.Sami Hudson, homecoming queen contestant, backstage during the 2014 homecoming coronation in the gymnasium at Laurens-Marathon High School in Laurens, Iowa, in Pocahontas County.\u00a0Iowa farmers received more than $1\u2009billion in federal aid and subsidies in 2012, according to the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation.. It is no wonder that the most heated policy debate in the Senate race here is over a federal measure, coveted by farmers, that guarantees a market for corn-based ethanol by requiring energy companies to blend billions of gallons of the biofuel with gasoline for cars.Ms. Ernst, a Tea Party favorite, declared herself philosophically opposed to rule, known as the Renewable Fuel Standard. That prompted a series of attacks from Mr. Braley, and ever-firmer assurances from Ms. Ernst that she would nonetheless fight to protect the fuel measure. The Iowa Corn Growers Association PAC was not satisfied: In a move that stung Ms. Ernst\u2019s campaign, it endorsed Mr. Braley.A similar dissonance has surrounded the issue of climate change. Ms. Ernst, skeptical about the role of human activity in global warming, is wary of any government mandates to cut carbon emissions.

{"Headline": "Former Bankia Chairman Rodrigo Rato Is Accused of Misusing Company Credit Cards", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 The former chairman of Bankia, the giant mortgage lender whose near-collapse in 2012 plunged Spain into a crisis that required an international bailout, has been accused, along with dozens of others, of making lavish personal use of the company\u2019s credit cards.The former chairman, Rodrigo Rato, also a former head of the International Monetary Fund and still a prominent business figure in Spain, was subpoenaed on Wednesday along with his predecessor at the bank, Miguel Blesa.A judge has ordered them to appear on Oct. 16 before Spain\u2019s national court to answer allegations that they misused their credit-card privileges while at the bank and that over the years, they provided dozens of members of the board with unauthorized company credit cards. Prosecutors said the cards were used for personal purchases, including clothing and travel, as well as cash withdrawals.According to prosecutors, Mr. Rato, 65 and a former finance minister of Spain, had 54,800 euros, or about $69,200, in unauthorized spending. They accuse Mr. Blesa, 67, of spending about eight times as much: \u20ac436,700.In all, prosecutors say, audited documents indicate the personal spending by the executives and directors totaled \u20ac15.25 million.Mr. Rato has declined to comment on the credit card controversy, but according to Spanish news media reports, he is among those who have returned money spent with the credit cards.The bank\u2019s credit card system is being investigated by Spain\u2019s national court separately from a broader case that began two years ago to examine whether former managers of Bankia misstated earnings and brought the lender close to a collapse that resulted in the need for a \u20ac40 billion European bailout in 2012.The prosecution\u2019s audit covered 86 users of the credit cards, many of whom were connected to Spanish politics, trade unions and even the royal family, as part of a Spanish financial system in which savings banks like Bankia were closely controlled by politicians.The judge, Fernando Andreu, on Wednesday subpoenaed Ildefonso S\u00e1nchez Barcoj, a former director general of Caja Madrid, who is accused of personal spending totaling \u20ac484,200 with the bank\u2019s credit card. Caja Madrid was the largest among the seven savings banks, or cajas, that merged to form Bankia in 2011.Spain\u2019s budget ministry said last week it would investigate other major corporations listed on the main Ibex stock market index to see whether they also allowed directors to finance private purchases with corporate credit cards.Mr. Blesa was chairman of Caja Madrid for 13 years, before being replaced in 2010 by Mr. Rato, who had also been finance minister in the conservative government of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, which was in office from 1996 to 2004. Mr. Rato then led the I.M.F. from 2004 to 2007, getting the Washington-based job thanks to his reputation for presiding over the early stages of Spain\u2019s construction-led boom.The Bankia merger was coordinated by Mr. Rato as a way to consolidate the caja sector after the bursting of Spain\u2019s real estate construction bubble in 2008. The idea was to let stronger entities like Caja Madrid absorb the losses of weaker ones threatened by their exposure to problem real estate loans.Instead, Bankia ended up requiring about half of the European bailout, after posting a loss for 2012 of \u20ac19.2 billion, a record for the Spanish banking industry.Mr. Rato resigned just before the state nationalized Bankia in May 2012. Last year, a slimmed-down Bankia returned to profit, under new management.In July 2012, nearly three dozen former Bankia executives and board members, including Mr. Rato, appeared in court in a criminal inquiry into whether they misrepresented Bankia\u2019s financial soundness as the bank was preparing a public stock offering. The former Bankia executives deny wrongdoing in the case, which is continuing.Since then, Mr. Rato has managed to return to Spain\u2019s corporate scene as a board member of two of its largest companies, Telef\u00f3nica and Banco Santander, as well as of a real estate subsidiary of Caixabank.Since the scandal emerged last week, a dozen former directors implicated in the audit have resigned or lost their current jobs. All have denied wrongdoing, though, saying they used their cards within rules set by the bank and were unaware that it could be considered fraud.Among the ex-directors is Pablo Abejas, who was ousted from the Madrid regional economy ministry, and Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Mart\u00ednez, who quit as a leader of the powerful union U.G.T. in Madrid.Rafael Spottorno, who managed Spain\u2019s royal household under King Juan Carlos, presented his resignation on Tuesday as an adviser to the new king, Felipe VI, saying he did not want the monarchy to be tainted by his personal behavior. Mr. Spottorno is accused of spending \u20ac223,900 with the credit card.Mr. Blesa has not commented on the credit card allegations. He is the subject of a separate case, in which he is accused of letting Caja Madrid buy the City National Bank of Florida in 2008 at an inflated price without doing due diligence and checking into City National\u2019s underlying liabilities. Mr. Blesa has said his oversight of the City National deal followed standard procedures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building a Bamboo Bulwark Against the Hong Kong Police", "Date": "2014-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Eric Wu, a 37-year-old construction worker, has spent his entire adult life building and climbing bamboo scaffolding as high as 50 floors above the ground.He paused occasionally from expertly lashing together 12-foot-long poles with strips of black plastic to give instructions to student protesters, who were more clumsily trying to tie poles together using long lengths of clear plastic wrapping. He talked about how he thought democracy would create a better Hong Kong, but also gave an economic reason for his presence at the demonstration: \u201cTimes are tough; there are no jobs in construction.\u201dProtesters added more bamboo-pole lattices to their barricades through Monday evening, and were sawing off the ends of some of the longer poles to give them long, sharp points. If the protesters wield the poles as pikes, they could make it considerably more dangerous for police or others to try to disperse them.At his daily afternoon news conference on Monday, Hui Chun-tak, the chief police spokesman, labeled all further construction of barricades as \u201cillegal and highly irresponsible,\u201d though he did not single out bamboo barricades in particular.The pro-democracy protesters have occupied parts of Hong Kong for more than three weeks.On Tuesday, the police cited the sharpened bamboo as a reason for dismantling some of the barricades.Bamboo scaffolding is an ancient building technique in China, in use for more than 1,000 years. While mainland China has curtailed its use for buildings more than six stories tall for safety reasons, it remains popular here.Generations of construction workers here have learned through an elaborate apprenticeship system the techniques of lashing bamboo together. Construction executives and engineers say that bamboo offers a sturdy yet flexible alternative to steel, particularly in a coastal environment where strong winds and typhoons can blow in off the South China Sea.Bamboo is still popular in Hong Kong because the poles are one-sixth the price and one-third the weight of steel poles, and they can be erected in half the time of steel scaffolding, said Flord So, the chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Scaffolders General Merchant Association, a trade group. Bamboo poles are somewhat more likely to break, including in storms, but inflict far less damage when they fall than do steel poles, he added.Blue-collar workers like Mr. Wu, often unemployed and disaffected by the high cost of living in Hong Kong, have joined the protesters in significant numbers, although students appear to make up the largest share of demonstrators.The overall unemployment rate in Hong Kong has stayed steady for the past several years at around 3.3 percent. But the broad rate disguises pockets of unemployment among the young and less educated. Unemployment has been a particular problem among construction workers, as builders have imported inexpensive prefabricated sections of buildings from factories in mainland China, reducing the need for labor in Hong Kong.Sam Tse, a 54-year-old electrician, came to the demonstrations on Monday afternoon for the first time to show support for the protesters and their calls for democracy. He said that he lived in public housing and despaired of earning enough to buy his own home in Hong Kong, where studio apartments measuring just 177 square feet and in an outlying area went on sale this summer for $250,000.\u201cIt was tough to make a living before, but if you worked hard, you could move up \u2014 now, even if you work hard, you can\u2019t move ahead,\u201d Mr. Tse said.Mr. Wu and Mr. Tse declined to give their full Chinese names, fearing that could make it easier for the police to track them down if the protests triggered a broader crackdown.After Mr. Wu and the students finished the construction of their bamboo lattice, he headed to another barricade that students were reinforcing with plywood. Mr. Wu studied their efforts and began barking instructions.\u201cIf we can just find some nails,\u201d he said, \u201cthis barrier will be very sturdy.\u201dHilda Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

His team, the Washington Nationals, would lose that game, on Oct. 4, in 18 innings, and the Giants would be one win closer to the World Series.As important as it was in the Giants-Nationals series, Harper\u2019s at-bat also had a larger significance. It was typical of a subtle change in Major League Baseball\u2019s strike zone that has had a profound impact on baseball in the last several seasons.The strike zone is bigger than it used to be, especially around batters\u2019 knees.This year\u2019s World Series teams, the Giants and Kansas City Royals, embody the change. They feature fairly pedestrian lineups and bullpens full of fearsome throwers. They have made it to the World Series by frequently holding their postseason opponents to two runs or fewer.Many television analysts and fans attribute the scoring drop to the advent of drug testing in recent years, which has seemed to put an end to hulking home-run hitters like Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds. A ban on amphetamines may also have disproportionately affected hitters, who tend to play every day. But people who study baseball data argue that the story is more complicated than it appears.The new research shows that those pitchers also have the benefit of throwing to a larger strike zone than their predecessors.The new part of the strike zone \u2014 the areas where pitches are called strikes more than half of the time \u2014 is roughly equal in size to a single row of baseballs, Mills said. That hypothetical row of balls does not extend to the corners of home plate, because pitches there are still called balls most of the time.In interviews, some players and coaches said they had noticed an expansion in the strike zone, while others said they had not.\u201cThe first few years I came up,\u201d said Josh Willingham, a Royals outfielder who has been in the major leagues since 2004, \u201cthey emphasized calling the high strike zone a bit more. Maybe it\u2019s lowered a bit, yeah.\u201dJavier Lopez, a relief pitcher for the Giants, said, \u201cMore calls are coming on the knee-high strike than they would on the waist or a thigh-high pitch.\u201d Al Leiter, the former pitcher who is now an analyst on MLB Network, added, \u201cThere was a time when there were a lot fewer strikes called.\u201dOthers, though, said that they noticed only that different umpires called different a strike zone, not any larger trend. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the strike zone has changed,\u201d said Michael Morse of the Giants. Rick Kranitz, the Brewers\u2019 pitching coach, said, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like the low strike has been called more often.\u201dResearchers said they were not surprised that the changes could often go unnoticed. Small changes in complicated systems \u2014 whether baseball, the economy or the climate \u2014 are often imperceptible to human eyes and yet important.Perhaps more notable than what players are saying is what they are doing: reacting to the new strike zone, rationally. Pitchers have begun throwing more pitches around the knees, and batters are swinging at a larger share of the pitches in that area.The share of pitches between 18 and 24 inches high rose to 18.3 percent this season, from 16.8 percent in 2009, according to Roegele\u2019s research. Batters now swing at 49.2 percent of those pitches, up from 45 percent. The trends lead to more strikeouts and more at-bats when a batter, behind in the count, becomes defensive. And they also lead to more ground-ball outs, because low pitches are tough to hit.\u201cThat\u2019s really where we teach all our pitchers to pitch,\u201d Kranitz, the Brewers\u2019 pitching coach, said. \u201cIf the ball gets in the air, there are a heck of a lot more places the ball can be an extra-base hit or a home run.\u201dIn his paper, Mills attributes between 25 percent and 40 percent of the scoring decline to the larger strike zone, and he said that he considered that estimate conservative.The zone may have begun growing about a decade ago, when Major League Baseball began using video to evaluate umpires\u2019 calls behind home plate. But the 2009-10 off-season, when the league put a more comprehensive system into place, seems to have been a turning point. Umpires now receive a report after each game breaking down their performance.But a more accurate, consistent strike zone is not necessarily producing a game that all fans like more. \u201cPersonally,\u201d Mills said, \u201cI enjoy watching lots of home runs.\u201dNor does it mean that calls are always consistent. Mills estimates the pitch that frustrated Harper \u2014 causing him to turn around and scream at the umpire \u2014 would have been called a strike slightly less than half the time in 2014. In 2007, it would have been a strike less than 10 percent of the time.Of course, distinguishing between an inch here or there, on a ball often traveling more than 90 miles an hour, is no easy thing.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the decline in offense in Major League Baseball. The number of runs per game is not 4.07.

{"Headline": "Hope, and Hard Work, in Ukraine", "Date": "2014-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThat pro-Western forces would win most of the seats in the Ukrainian parliamentary elections on Sunday was a foregone conclusion, given that Crimea and pro-Russian areas under the control of rebels did not participate. What is important is that the country now has a legitimate new president and Parliament, both elected since the ouster of Viktor Yanukovych in February and committed to reform and closer ties with the West. That, alas, does not guarantee a unified government, and whatever team emerges faces huge challenges: an empty treasury, agonizing reforms that cannot be delayed, the need to find fuel to survive the approaching winter, and all this while fighting continues in the southeast. The new Parliament simply cannot afford to sink back into the infighting and corruption that have been the hallmark of Ukrainian governments past.Sorting out these differences and forming an effective governing coalition could take time, and time is what Ukraine does not have. To qualify for critically needed aid from the International Monetary Fund \u2014 and to satisfy one of the major demands of the demonstrators who forced out Mr. Yanukovych \u2014 the government must move quickly on reforms and against corruption. But the most important reform, a sharp reduction in the size of the government bureaucracy, is bound to face fierce resistance when the economy is in crisis and winter is setting in, and a serious anti-corruption campaign would clip many politically active and powerful oligarchs.Even more immediate is the threat of a cutoff of Russian gas if Ukraine does not quickly come up with a debt payment of $1.5 billion. What is certain is that Russia will no longer subsidize Ukraine with low energy prices, as it did in the past. But, at least for now, Russia is not likely to do more damage. Russia signaled soon after the election that it is prepared to recognize the new Parliament, and its most likely tactic will be to push for negotiations between Kiev and the two breakaway regions in southeastern Ukraine. The two \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d \u2014 Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 have scheduled their own elections for early November, and Moscow will insist that these are the people the new Ukrainian government must talk to.Any effort to return the rebels to Ukraine, probably in some form of federation, cannot begin until President Poroshenko and the next government take the painful measures needed to restore financial order and good governance in Kiev. It is anyone\u2019s guess how much more turmoil the Ukrainian people can take after they have watched their country battered, dismembered and bankrupted. But those Ukrainians who could vote on Sunday demonstrated that a large majority still support reform and a Westward course. At this critical juncture, it is imperative that the United States and European Union support them with immediate, tangible and generous support.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dam Rising in Ethiopia Stirs Hope and Tension", "Date": "2014-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUBA, Ethiopia \u2014 There is a remote stretch of land in Ethiopia\u2019s forested northwest where the dust never settles. All week, day and night, thousands of workers pulverize rocks and lay concrete along a major tributary of the Nile River. It is the site of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, the continent\u2019s biggest hydropower plant and one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects ever in Africa.Ethiopia is a poor country, often known best for its past famines, but officials say the dam will be paid for without foreign assistance \u2014 a point of national pride. Computer-generated images of the finished structure are framed in government offices, splashed across city billboards and broadcast in repeated specials on the state-owned television channel.\u201cWe lean on the generousness of the rest of the world,\u201d said Zadig Abrha, deputy director of the dam\u2019s public mobilization office. \u201cSo there is a conviction on the part of the public to change this, to regain our lost greatness, to divorce ourselves from the status quo of poverty. And the first thing that we need to do is make use of our natural resources, like water.\u201dEthiopia, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies, has poured its resources into a slew of megaprojects in recent years, including dams, factories, roads and railways across the country.But its strong, state-driven approach has been criticized for displacing rural communities, elbowing out private investors and muzzling political dissent. The Renaissance Dam, its biggest project, has met with resistance even outside Ethiopia\u2019s borders, setting off a heated diplomatic battle with Egypt that, at one point, led to threats of war.In Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second most populous nation, constant power shortages stifle economic growth. The hydropower plant is expected to bring the country\u2019s electricity generation to more than triple its current capacity. Aside from a $1 billion loan from China for a transmission line, the government projects a $4.02 billion cost for the dam, with more than $1.3 billion already spent.Near the border with Sudan, the dam is inching skyward as workers apply layer after layer of concrete that will eventually create a reservoir covering nearly 650 square miles. About 8,500 workers live at the project site, served by several cafeterias, a market, a barbershop and spotty Wi-Fi access. Giant floodlights keep construction going around the clock, and employees often work the whole week through.From the very beginning, this relentless drive has put Ethiopia at odds with Egypt. The Renaissance Dam is on the Blue Nile, a tributary that contributes most of the water flowing into the Nile River, heightening concerns that it could threaten Egypt\u2019s most vital natural resource. Fears of armed conflict surfaced during the brief tenure of Egypt\u2019s former president, Mohamed Morsi, who said last year that \u201cEgyptian blood\u201d would substitute for every drop of lost water.But under Egypt\u2019s current president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the icy relationship between the two countries has begun to thaw. Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, and Mr. Sisi had a cordial first meeting in June, and water ministers from Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan met for renewed discussions in late August. Egypt\u2019s new foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, set a diplomatic tone during a visit last month to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, declaring \u201ca new phase of our relationship based on mutual understanding, mutual respect and a recognition that the Nile binds us.\u201dEthiopia\u2019s biggest obstacle to finishing the dam is not geopolitics \u2014 it is money. The project is overseen by Ethiopian Electric Power, a state-owned utility that is helping finance the project with its own revenue and loans from state-owned banks. Though the government may raise more money by selling bonds on global markets in the coming years, the current tactic of borrowing from state banks is draining available credit. That could squeeze private enterprise in a country that already has the world\u2019s sixth-lowest rate of private investment as a percentage of G.D.P., said Lars C. Moller, the World Bank\u2019s lead economist in Ethiopia.\u201cFor every dollar of credit and every dollar of foreign exchange the project gets, there\u2019s less for the rest of the economy, including the private sector,\u201d he said.\u201cBut in the long term, the investment is likely to pay off well,\u201d Mr. Moller added, noting that Ethiopia\u2019s plan to sell excess energy to neighboring counties could bring in about $1 billion in annual export revenue starting in 2021, four years after the dam is scheduled to be completed.Ethiopia\u2019s state finance minister, Abraham Tekeste, said it was a price worth paying. \u201cWe know that we are sacrificing in the short term, but this is for a long-term objective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any contradiction.\u201dMore than $357 million spent so far has come from Ethiopians, both domestically and abroad, who have been encouraged to donate money or purchase bonds, according to Mr. Zadig.Workers on the government payroll, some of whom make as little as $32.68 per month, have been pushed to buy bonds worth a full month\u2019s salary every year through a system that deducts straight from their paychecks.Merera Gudina, an opposition party leader who teaches political science at the government-funded Addis Ababa University, said he and colleagues had complained when their wages were siphoned off for bond purchases, leading the university to stop the program after about one year.\u201cPeople were not against the dam, but there were a lot of logistical questions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not paying voluntarily.\u201dThe government also leads meetings to encourage private-sector workers to buy bonds. Wossene Hailu, whose Wossi Garment Design Factory sits on the outskirts of the capital, got involved when members of her garment association were invited to one of these gatherings. \u201cWe got a lot of information \u2014 how it\u2019s done, how we can benefit from it, things like that \u2014 and everyone was convinced,\u201d she said.Ethiopia is desperate to spur manufacturing, which it sees as critical to its long-term growth. But the industry has been just 4 percent of the nation\u2019s G.D.P. for years. Ms. Wossene\u2019s lean enterprise fills small international orders and produces clothes and blankets for local markets, but she said whole-day power failures sometimes caused delays.The situation is even more dire in rural areas, where most households are not connected to the grid. This is a symptom of broader developmental challenges: Despite government claims that the economy has grown at an average rate of 10.9 percent annually over the last decade, Ethiopia remains poor, with about 30 percent of the population living on less than $1.25 per day.Officials hope the dam will chip away at that imbalance, but its first impact on poor communities will be disruptive. The project manager, Semegnew Bekele, said the reservoir would displace an estimated 3,700 households.Other development projects have also been criticized. A smaller dam nearing completion in southern Ethiopia could threaten ecosystems affecting hundreds of thousands of people. Huge land leases to foreign commercial farms have displaced communities and left tens of thousands of acres uncultivated.Clearing land has only just begun, but Mr. Semegnew said those displaced would be fairly compensated.On a regional level, experts say the dam\u2019s overall environmental effect could be positive. Though rainfall may increase in East Africa as a result of global warming, it could also become less predictable, said Matthew McCartney, a principal researcher at the International Water Management Institute. The Renaissance Dam could mitigate this problem by regulating the flow of the Blue Nile and potentially increasing it during dry periods, he said.Building the vast reservoir needed to generate maximum power, on the other hand, poses some risks to Egypt and Sudan, as it will temporarily lessen the flow downstream.\u201cBecause it is such a large volume of storage, to mitigate downstream impacts, the dam will have to be filled over a period of several years,\u201d Dr. McCartney said. \u201cThe rate of filling will need to vary depending on inflows, which will in turn depend on the rainfall.\u201dTwo vital studies on downstream effects will be carried out over the next six months, and Egypt will be keeping a critical eye on the results. But for many Ethiopians, the dam is a testament to the abilities of a country determined to go it alone.\u201cIt\u2019s hope, it\u2019s hope,\u201d Ms. Wossene said. \u201cWhen I see the dam on TV, I say: \u2018Ah, very soon. We\u2019re getting there!\u2019 That\u2019s the feeling I get.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Auditor\u2019s Report Making Waves Ahead of Vote", "Date": "2014-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneThe Texas Enterprise Fund was in trouble for a long time before it was the centerpiece of a harsh state audit.It is an economic development fund under the control of Gov. Rick Perry, designed to close deals that lure businesses and industries to Texas.The State Auditor\u2019s report was a scorcher, saying money from the fund was granted with little or no documentation in some cases, that Mr. Perry\u2019s office and other state officials did not adequately monitor the beneficiaries to see that they were delivering what they had promised, and that financial and management controls were spotty, especially when the program was getting started.This is a hot political subject right now. The auditor released the report just weeks before Texans start voting for their next set of statewide officeholders.The direct damage is to the sitting governor, who is not on the ballot this year. But among the front-runners, Democratic State Senator Wendy Davis wrote the legislation that sparked the examination of the fund, and Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott was arguably supposed to be one of its watchdogs. One of those two candidates will soon be in charge of this and similar economic development accounts.In a debate last week, Mr. Abbott and Ms. Davis wrangled about the fund. He repeated doubts about the state \u201cchoosing winners and losers\u201d; she expressed support for such efforts so long as the controls are tight and the politics are kept out.That is the rub: Economic development officials all over the country use incentive funds to attract and retain job-making enterprises in their jurisdictions. You can like the business argument or not, but it is true that those who offer financial incentives often have an advantage over those who do not.The political argument cuts both ways. A governor with a deal fund or two or three can generate a lot of economic development news, attracting more attention to the state and arguably bringing in business that would otherwise land elsewhere. For Mr. Perry, that is a keystone in the \u201cTexas Miracle\u201d that has the state\u2019s economy outperforming its peers over the past decade.Doing a good job, as they say, is the best politics. The political negative is contained in the phrase \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d \u2014 the idea that the programs allow politicians to dish out public funds to reward their political supporters.\u201cThey are too concentrated, and the power is in the hands of too small a group of people,\u201d State Senator Kevin Eltife, Republican of Tyler, said of the programs. \u201cThey are way too political.\u201dMr. Eltife, a former mayor of Tyler, does believe incentive funds can work at the local level, but said the state can do other things more effectively to attract business, like getting rid of or lowering the unpopular tax on business gross receipts. \u201cI think the funds ought to be eliminated,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s create incentives for every business in the state.\u201dDuring Mr. Perry\u2019s long tenure as governor, lawmakers have attempted several times to get rid of the incentive funds. And they are officially reconsidering the state\u2019s economic development programs in anticipation of the January 2015 legislative session.The House, for instance, is looking \u2014 after\u00a0the programs have run for\u00a0more than a decade \u2014 to see if the incentives are producing results. And they are looking at economic development operations in the governor\u2019s office itself with an eye toward how those executive efforts dovetail with local and regional efforts around the state. Some, like State Representative Cecil Bell Jr., Republican of Magnolia, say the state has to protect taxpayers but should keep incentive funds to compete for jobs.But the audit could be the nail in the coffin. Democrats have objected to putting a stack of blank checks in a Republican governor\u2019s pocket. Conservatives have objected to putting blank checks into anyone\u2019s pocket. After several years of prosperity, many seem convinced that Texas is attractive enough without the government enticements.Kathie Glass, the Libertarian candidate for governor, said she would not even travel the country to sell businesses on the state, much less use incentives. \u201cIf people want to come into Texas and do business,\u201d she said, \u201cthey know where to find us.\u201drramsey@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

But they refused to implement the cuts any faster than that, warning that doing so would endanger the country\u2019s feeble economy.\u201cNo further effort will be demanded of the French, because the government \u2014 while taking the fiscal responsibility needed to put the country on the right track \u2014 rejects austerity,\u201d the government said in a statement.The move threatens to intensify a showdown between Paris and its main eurozone partners \u2014 particularly Germany, where some officials have expressed concern that France is seeking exceptional treatment under European Union rules, even as other crisis-hit countries, like Spain and Ireland, manage to improve their finances.At the same time, Mr. Hollande\u2019s critics within France accused him of imposing too much austerity in the budget, which calls for deep cuts in health care, family subsidies, government payrolls and local and national spending.Leftist members of his own Socialist Party accused Mr. Hollande of undermining France\u2019s vaunted social welfare model. Meanwhile, a former conservative prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, warned that France risked a \u201cserious financial accident\u201d if it did not mend its economy.Mr. Hollande, who already has the lowest popularity ratings of any modern French president, is trying to walk a fine line between promoting economic growth and appeasing European officials who want countries to reduce their deficits. In a bid to keep the French economy from sliding into outright recession, less than half of the 50 billion euros in cuts would be unrolled in the next year.Nonetheless, on Tuesday, the day before the budget was presented, nearly all pharmacies and notary agencies in France were shuttered, and thousands of employees took to the streets to protest changes that also included plans to open various sectors of the economy to greater competition. Parents and school officials called for major rallies across France this weekend to protest 700 million euros in planned cuts in family benefits and \u20ac3.2 billion in health spending cuts.The announcements amounted to a fresh rebuke to Germany and the austerity movement at a time when the new French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, has acknowledged that France\u2019s economy, the eurozone\u2019s second-largest, after Germany\u2019s, is \u201csick.\u201dContinued stagnation or a further slowdown in the French economy could weigh on a European recovery, which has been alarmingly slow after the Continent\u2019s lengthy debt crisis. On Tuesday, Italy warned that its economy, the eurozone\u2019s third largest, was heading into a third straight year of recession and would be unable to meet its deficit target before 2017.Growth in the 18 countries that share the euro currency ground to a halt in the last quarter, and the region\u2019s unemployment rate remained stuck at 11.5 percent. By contrast, the American economy appears to be recovering from one of its worst downturns since the 1930s, and unemployment has declined to around 6 percent from about 10 percent during the trough of the more recent financial crisis.On Wednesday, Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, warned that the country would continue to experience slow growth for at least the next three years, with the economy expanding by just 0.4 percent this year before reaching a 2 percent pace only in 2019.A few hours later, though, even that gloomy forecast was attacked by the French High Council of Public Finances as being too optimistic.France is effectively arguing that circumstances justify flouting the eurozone budget rules that it, together with Germany, played a critical role in shaping during the creation of the currency union a decade and a half ago. France is demanding more leniency from Brussels to meet European Union deficit targets, having already missed two deadlines in the past three years.\u201cWe have taken the decision to adapt the pace of deficit reduction to the economic situation of the country,\u201d Mr. Sapin said Wednesday.With growth weak across Europe, France is hardly alone: Last year, Ireland, Spain and Greece were among those countries that also failed to comply with the bloc\u2019s requirement that budget deficits not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product.But France has not been under the 3 percent cap in a decade. Mr. Sapin said France\u2019s deficit would be around 4.3 percent of G.D.P. in 2015. Lowering the deficit faster would require the bulk of the spending cuts to come sooner.Because the cuts are being spread over three years, the deficit will not fall below the 3 percent threshold set by the European Union until 2017, Mr. Sapin said.What is more, Paris said this week that government debt would top \u20ac2 trillion for the first time. That represents 95 percent of G.D.P., well above the 60 percent level called for by the European Union.It is unclear whether the European Commission, the administrative branch that oversees the national budgets of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states, will see France\u2019s appeal in a favorable light.The commission is expected to render a verdict this month on the French budget plan. If France is found to be in breach of the rules, it could face sanctions and fines.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France last month in Berlin that his country had made \u201cvery ambitious\u201d plans to rein in public spending, which, at 56 percent of G.D.P., is among the highest in eurozone.Still, she said, France needed bolder changes to the way its economy functions in order to generate growth and jobs.Hours after France\u2019s announcement on Wednesday, a German business group issued a more pointed assessment.\u201cIf that country doesn\u2019t figure a way out of the downward spiral, the euro and Europe are at risk,\u201d Anton B\u00f6rner, the president of BGA, Germany\u2019s largest exporters association, said in a speech in Berlin.Germany has encouraged austerity in other countries, including Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal, as a way to keep the euro debt crisis at bay. But many economists believe that crimping spending during a downturn has impeded economic growth, which in turn has made it harder for those countries to reduce their deficits and debts.Each of those nations also pledged to carry out so-called structural reforms \u2014 economic changes intended to stoke growth and employment, including the easing of rules for hiring and firing workers and opening up protected professions to greater competition.Mr. Hollande intends to take bigger steps in that direction with his new budget, which in 2015 would slash about \u20ac9.6 billion from the French welfare state, \u20ac7.7 billion from other government spending, and \u20ac3.7 billion in spending cuts for municipalities.The cuts are partly aimed at offsetting 40 billion euros in tax breaks that Mr. Hollande promised business as part of a so-called responsibility pact, in which companies will pledge to hire more workers in an effort to reduce a national unemployment rate that remains stuck at around 10 percent.On Tuesday, in a speech to business leaders at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, Mr. Hollande delivered a stern warning to the nation. \u201cThere is no savings plan that is painless,\u201d he said.To control France\u2019s debt and deficit, \u201cwe must make savings,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hear screaming, that means we aren\u2019t saving.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Bailout Victims ", "Date": "2014-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMr. Greenberg, a former chief executive of the American International Group, is suing for $40 billion, asserting that the government treated him and other A.I.G shareholders too harshly in 2008, when it bailed out the failing insurer. By forcing everyone to focus on whether he was victimized, Mr. Greenberg has obscured an essential part of the story: the undisputed and largely uncompensated victim of how the bailouts were executed was and remains the American public.The injustice in that disparate treatment, however, is not that A.I.G was treated too harshly, but that the banks got off too easy. If the government had taken control of, say, Bank of America, taxpayers would have shared directly in its recovery. Instead, the subsequent gains flowed to shareholders who, but for the bailouts, would have been ruined. A judge will decide whether Mr. Greenberg has made his case. Almost everyone else will continue to struggle in what remains a damaged economy. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Florida State, Football Clouds Justice", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 The 911 call could not have sounded more urgent: A man was beating a woman holding a baby outside their apartment as she tried to leave.\u201cYou just need to get someone out here right away because it is really bad,\u201d the caller said, adding that the man was \u201cpunching\u201d the mother and \u201cgrabbing the little baby around the arm.\u201dBy the time the police arrived shortly after 3 a.m. one day last January, the couple were back inside. The 19-year-old woman acknowledged that she and her boyfriend had argued, and that he had not wanted her to leave. But she insisted nothing physical had occurred.Officers responding to a domestic violence call have a legal duty to investigate thoroughly, seek written statements from witnesses and from the victim, instruct the victim on how to seek help and, finally, forward their report to the local domestic abuse crisis center. But, according to their brief report on the episode, the officers did none of that.They did, however, find the case significant enough to notify their sergeant \u2014 \u201cdue to the fact that it was an F.S.U. football player,\u201d the report said. The sergeant, a Florida State University sports fan, signed off on it and the complaint was filed away as \u201cunfounded.\u201d It was hardly the first time that the towering presence of Florida State football had cast a shadow over justice in Tallahassee. Last year, the deeply flawed handling of a rape allegation against the quarterback Jameis Winston drew attention to institutional failures by law enforcement and Florida State officials. The accuser\u2019s lawyer complained that detectives had seemed most interested in finding reasons not to pursue charges against Mr. Winston, a prized recruit who went on to win the Heisman Trophy and lead his team to a national championship. Now, an examination by The New York Times of police and court records, along with interviews with crime witnesses, has found that, far from an aberration, the treatment of the Winston complaint was in keeping with the way the police on numerous occasions have soft-pedaled allegations of wrongdoing by Seminoles football players. From criminal mischief and motor-vehicle theft to domestic violence, arrests have been avoided, investigations have stalled and players have escaped serious consequences.In a community whose self-image and economic well-being are so tightly bound to the fortunes of the nation\u2019s top-ranked college football team, law enforcement officers are finely attuned to a suspect\u2019s football connections. Those ties are cited repeatedly in police reports examined by The Times. What\u2019s more, dozens of officers work second jobs directing traffic and providing security at home football games, and many express their devotion to the Seminoles on social media. Certainly, Florida State football players have not always sidestepped prosecution. Over the last three years, at least nine players have been arrested on charges ranging from sexual assault to being an accessory to a fatal shooting. But on other occasions, despite strong evidence, investigations have been delayed and sometimes derailed.When Jesus (Bobo) Wilson, an up-and-coming wide receiver, was stopped by the Tallahassee police in June while riding a stolen Bintelli Sprint motor scooter, his story was dubious: He claimed he had borrowed it from a student whose last name he did not know. But for Officer Michael Petroczky, it was convincing enough to forestall an arrest.The officer, noting in his report that Mr. Wilson was a Florida State football player, wrote: \u201cWilson was not arrested today because he cooperated, showed no signs of guilt and provided a plausible story that needs to be investigated.\u201d According to the scooter\u2019s owner, Mr. Wilson\u2019s football connections weighed heavily on the case. After letting Mr. Wilson go, the officer arranged to meet the owner, a Florida State student, in a campus parking lot at night and \u201cquestioned if I was mentally stable or if I had forgotten that I lent him the scooter,\u201d the student said in an email interview. The officer seemed deeply reluctant to charge Mr. Wilson, saying he did not want his name on the arrest report, according to the student.\u201cHe told me that he had not arrested Wilson because he was a football player, and he did not want to \u2018ruin\u2019 his record by arresting him\u201d if there was a chance he might be innocent, the student wrote. The investigation of the June shootout sat inactive for months but was restarted not long after The Times began asking about it; charges were filed against three Florida State players on Oct. 2.In a statement, the Tallahassee police chief, Michael DeLeo, who took over late last year, said that with 66,000 college students in the city, \u201cI take seriously the responsibility entrusted to us to keep them safe and also hold them accountable for their actions.\u201d And while he is proud of his officers, he said, if they make mistakes, \u201cwe immediately investigate and hold them accountable.\u201d In response to The Times\u2019s reporting on the police handling of the scooter case, the department has begun an internal-affairs inquiry. A police spokesman, Officer David Northway, added that because of likely attention from the community and news media, it was department policy for officers to notify supervisors if cases involved high-profile figures, from college football players to government officials and business leaders. The Times\u2019s reporting also yielded a fuller account of how Florida State handled the rape complaint against Mr. Winston. In January 2013, days after Mr. Winston was identified by his accuser, senior Florida State athletic officials met privately with Mr. Winston\u2019s lawyer. Afterward, they decided, on behalf of the university, not to begin an internal disciplinary inquiry, as required by federal law. Most recently, university officials suspended Mr. Winston for one game after he stood in a public place on campus and, playing off a running Internet gag, shouted a crude reference to a sex act. In a news conference afterward, his coach, Jimbo Fisher, said, \u201cOur hope and belief is Jameis will learn from this and use better judgment and language and decision-making.\u201d A search of his public Instagram page would have turned up a similar display. Amid photos of himself with his coach, the comedian Will Ferrell and the former N.F.L. quarterback Archie Manning, Mr. Winston posted a video clip in February in which he and a teammate, mimicking a viral music video, jokingly sang a line from the song \u201cOn the Floor\u201d by the rapper IceJJFish, which celebrates men not taking \u201cno\u201d for an answer from women:\u201cShe said she wants to take it slow, I\u2019m not that type of guy I\u2019ll letcha know, when I see that red light all I know is go.\u201dSeminole FeverOn one level, the special treatment accorded Florida State football players who get into trouble is the age-old story of important people reaping benefits not available to everyone else. And to say the players are important to Tallahassee would be an understatement.Drive around Florida\u2019s capital city and evidence of Seminole fever is everywhere, from the Chief Osceola license plates and bumper stickers to the billboards and buildings sporting team colors of garnet and gold. The community has good reason, beyond pride, to get behind the team: County officials say each home game pumps $1.5 million to $10 million into the local economy, depending on the quality of the matchup.The revenue also flows to important people at the university, mostly through the conduit of Seminole Boosters, a tax-exempt organization that collects millions from donors in the community, along with game concessions, sky-box rentals and merchandising. Money from the Boosters has helped pay the salaries of high-ranking athletic officials and the university president, whose performance goals included enhancing \u201cthe partnership\u201d between the Boosters and the athletic department.Days before the national championship game last season, Coach Fisher received a multimillion-dollar raise and contract extension. Most of his $3.5 million pay comes from the Boosters, and the more he wins, the more he earns \u2014 up to $1.45 million in bonuses, including $200,000 for an undefeated season, $200,000 for finishing with a top-five national ranking, $400,000 for winning the national championship and $125,000 for various coach-of-the-year honors. Mr. Fisher\u2019s first 12 bonuses are linked to winning, the last two, for a maximum payout of $75,000, to academic achievement for student athletes. A successful football program is also good for Tallahassee police officers. They earn an extra $40 to $45 an hour, at university expense, providing traffic control on game days, according to the department. Last season, officers were paid a total of $112,000, according to the university. Some officers working game-day shifts are paid directly by Seminole Boosters. Three officers who played important roles in the Winston investigation were among those seeking private work with the group, records show, and the department\u2019s top officials at the time \u2014 Chief Dennis Jones and his deputy, Cheryl Stewart \u2014 attended a 2012 fund-raiser benefiting the Boosters and Coach Fisher\u2019s family charity. The close connection between the police and the Boosters is hardly hidden: The fund-raiser\u2019s sponsor, a booster club called Old School, posted photos on its website showing Chief Jones kicking off the event by firing a shotgun.The benefits that flow from a top-tier team, and the incentives it creates to protect the franchise, are not unique to Florida State; indeed, they can be found in college towns across the country. But the current national uproar over professional athletes receiving light punishment for serious misbehavior has refocused attention on what some say is a similar failure to hold student athletes accountable in powerhouse college sports programs. Some critics of the N.F.L.\u2019s handling of recent domestic violence cases are asking if players learn the wrong lessons while still in school. Gerald Gurney, a former senior associate athletic director at the University of Oklahoma who teaches a course on \u201cethical issues in intercollegiate athletics,\u201d said the outsize influence of big-time collegiate sports could create a climate where keeping student athletes on the field trumped all other considerations.\u201cToo often, that relationship between the athletic department and local law enforcement is too close, where we lose objectivity and lose the ability to have a fair investigation if these students are athletes,\u201d Mr. Gurney said. \u201cWhy? No. 1 is the love of the sport, of college football and the public\u2019s attention to it, and the celebrity of the head coach and celebrity of the athletes.\u201dBB and Pellet GunsOn a Sunday evening in November 2012, as people milled about on West Tennessee Street near the Florida State campus, a red sport utility vehicle started cruising up and down, with someone inside firing a BB gun out a window. Bystanders were \u201cstung by BBs,\u201d and one nearly hit a security guard at an apartment complex, said Connie Ratliffe, the guard\u2019s supervisor at the time.\u201cI heard this \u2018ping, ping, ping\u2019 and felt something whiz past my cheek,\u201d as BBs struck a car she was standing next to, Ms. Ratliffe said in an interview. She added that she had pushed the guard back and ducked out of the way.The episode marked the beginning of an intermittent, nearly two-year run of dangerous mischief \u2014 much of it, including the November episode, previously unreported \u2014 involving Florida State football players using BB and pellet guns powerful enough to shatter windows, damage cars and embed steel BBs in door frames. According to a Tallahassee police account, the authorities put out an alert for the vehicle and soon pulled over a red Mercury with Marvin Bracy, Chris Casher and Kenneth Williams inside. The officer\u2019s report says that the three young men \u201ctold me they were on the F.S.U. football team,\u201d and that the police retrieved a black \u201csemi-auto pistol BB gun\u201d hidden under a rug in the back of the car.Ms. Ratliffe identified the car but could not say which of the players had been firing the gun. The players denied shooting at anyone. The officer gave Mr. Bracy, the driver, a traffic ticket, and then \u201cthe BB gun was returned to Mr. Bracy,\u201d according to the report. No charges were filed. The police spokesman, Officer Northway, said that without anyone to identify a suspect, \u201cthere was no ability to move ahead.\u201d \u201cThey were doing something that was really dangerous, that could have put somebody\u2019s eye out or caused a car accident,\u201d said Ms. Ratliffe, who did not know the players were never charged. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dA couple of weeks later, the university police responded to a complaint that two men were walking on a bike trail carrying a \u201clong-barreled handgun.\u201d The officers ordered the men \u2014 identified as Mr. Winston and Mr. Casher \u2014 onto the ground and handcuffed them, before determining that the gun was a pellet gun. The players said they had been shooting at squirrels, and were let go.Later that night, according to the property manager at the nearby Legacy Suites apartments, Mr. Winston, Mr. Casher, Mr. Williams and another player, Mario Edwards Jr., took part in a shootout that caused $4,200 in damage to 13 windows. The manager, David Sudekum, told the Tallahassee police that he planned to evict all four players and had called the Florida State athletic department, but that \u201cnone of the suspects have come forward to pay for damages.\u201d The police report said the case was being investigated as a potential felony, since it involved damage in excess of $1,000 resulting from criminal mischief.Under university rules, a felony arrest results in automatic suspension from the team.After officers made inquiries, Monk Bonasorte, an associate athletic director, said the cost of replacing the windows would be split among the four players and others involved in the shootout. In response to questions from The Times, the university said 13 of the team\u2019s 100 or so players \u2014 far more than reported earlier \u2014 had paid $300 apiece. The police report added that Mr. Sudekum no longer wanted to pursue charges, and the case was dropped.This past June, Florida State players were implicated in another previously unreported BB-gun shooting that caused damage and frightened tenants at the Cypress Gardens apartment complex. In what appeared to be retaliation for a BB-gun assault that shattered the apartment windows of a Florida State player that morning, three football players drove into the complex\u2019s parking lot, jumped out and started exchanging fire with a fourth man.In the ensuing mayhem, two cars belonging to tenants were damaged \u2014 the back window of one was shattered, and the other was hit five times, causing dents and smashing the side mirror \u2014 and frightened bystanders took cover.\u201cWhatever they were using, these weren\u2019t toys you get at Walmart, they had some power behind them,\u201d said Cameron Manning, whose apartment overlooks the scene. \u201cIt looked like a drug deal gone bad.\u201dPolice officers responded and, based on witnesses and a security camera video, initially believed the shooting involved firearms. Officers fanned out to search the area and called in a helicopter from the Leon County Sheriff\u2019s Office. A homicide investigator from the Tallahassee police violent crimes unit was assigned to the case.The investigator, Scott Cherry, soon figured out that the shooting had involved BB guns and within a day had identified four suspects: a Cypress Gardens resident named Prince Adams and three Florida State football players, Dalvin Cook, Trey Marshall and Mr. Wilson, the wide receiver. The sensitivity of the football players\u2019 involvement became clear in what happened next.According to a report that he wrote later, the investigator described the facts of the case to the state attorney\u2019s office on July 2, but at first did not reveal the \u201cnames or status of the subjects.\u201d Then, after explaining that three of them were Florida State players, \u201cI was instructed that the issue would have to be \u2018round-tabled\u2019 with the division chiefs\u201d before deciding what to do, he wrote.The chief assistant state attorney, Georgia Cappleman, said, \u201cWe round-tabled the matter to get a consensus because the prosecutors who were reviewing it did not agree on how the matter should be handled.\u201d Ultimately, they concluded that the crime involved was disorderly conduct \u2014 a lesser offense than the criminal mischief designation the investigator was considering.The inquiry went nowhere for more than two months until the police began interviewing the players on Sept. 8, not long after The Times began asking about it. In his report, the investigator wrote that he had been preoccupied with more serious cases over the summer. He said the state attorney\u2019s office \u201clooked at this incident again\u201d and decided that a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief was, in fact, warranted, and on Oct. 2, all four suspects were charged and ordered to appear in court later this month.The criminal mischief count fell short of a felony because the police estimated the damage to the tenants\u2019 cars at less than $1,000. In arriving at that figure, investigators did not take into account the cost of the apartment windows that had been shot out earlier the same day in an episode that witnesses said involved some of the same suspects.The police spokesman said the chief had found the delay in the case to be unacceptable and had instituted a new policy to prevent such lapses. Stolen ScooterThe BB-gun investigation came at an inopportune time for Mr. Wilson, who on June 17, just a week before the shootout, had been stopped by the Tallahassee police for riding around on the motor scooter that had been reported stolen. At first, it was unclear if he would face charges related to the theft, as he insisted to the officers that he had borrowed the scooter from a student he knew only as \u201cDrew.\u201dOfficer Petroczky\u2019s initial report was not short on praise for Mr. Wilson. After the officer identified him as a football player, he wrote, Mr. Wilson did not attempt to flee and \u201cwas completely cooperative and calm during the entire encounter.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is not typical for a suspect that is knowingly operating a stolen vehicle to be so compliant.\u201dLater that night, after meeting the scooter\u2019s owner in the Florida State parking lot, Officer Petroczky wrote an addendum to his report, saying he had concluded that the owner was not, in fact, the mysterious \u201cDrew\u201d and had not lent the vehicle to anyone. Yet he still did not arrest Mr. Wilson, and instead turned the whole matter over to the university police, where the case languished for weeks.The police spokesman, Officer Northway, said the chief had ordered his internal-affairs unit to look into the case because \u201cthe allegation that an officer might have tried to influence a citizen not to file charges in a possible felony theft is a serious allegation.\u201d The scooter owner, who asked that he not be identified out of concern for retaliation on campus, said in the email interview that it was only after his father complained to the police that the case had picked up steam.\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like they were pursuing the case much and were waiting to see if I would just forget about it or let it be,\u201d the student said. Mr. Wilson finally admitted that he had stolen the scooter after finding it with the keys in the ignition, and on July 9 he was charged with grand-theft auto, a felony. Mr. Wilson was suspended from play, although he took part in summer practice.Mr. Wilson\u2019s lawyer, Tim Jansen, who specializes in representing Florida State athletes in trouble, succeeded in getting the charge reduced to a misdemeanor. Mr. Wilson pleaded no contest, was sentenced to 30 days on a sheriff\u2019s work detail \u2014 to begin after football season \u2014 and through his lawyer paid $1,000 restitution for damage to the scooter. It is unclear where he came up with the money. According to a letter his mother wrote to the judge in an eviction proceeding that was happening at the same time, neither she nor her son could pay his back rent and utilities of $3,139. She said she was out of work and could come up with only $1,000 for her son\u2019s landlord. Florida State reinstated Mr. Wilson after the Seminoles\u2019 first game; five weeks into the season, he was the team\u2019s second-leading receiver. Rape AccusationOn Jan. 10, 2013, a female student at Florida State spotted the man she believed had raped her the previous month. After learning his name, Jameis Winston, she reported him to the Tallahassee police.In the 21 months since, Florida State officials have said little about how they handled the case, which is now one of dozens across the nation being investigated by the federal Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights.But new information has recently emerged, as part of The Times\u2019s continuing examination of the case, indicating that it was Florida State\u2019s athletic department that decided the allegation did not merit a university investigation. Normally, university officials outside the department handle such matters. According to a statement released by the university on Tuesday, senior athletic department officials met with Mr. Winston\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Jansen, within days of his identification as a suspect and quickly concluded that \u201cthere were no grounds for further action.\u201d The accuser\u2019s former lawyer, Patricia A. Carroll, said the department did not contact her at the time to get her client\u2019s side of the story. Although Florida State was legally obligated to conduct a \u201cprompt, thorough and impartial\u201d disciplinary inquiry, the university chose not to, as the team marched to the national championship. \u201cThis is exactly the cover-up we suspected,\u201d Baine P. Kerr, a lawyer for Mr. Winston\u2019s accuser, said in a statement responding to the new information. \u201cCoach Fisher and his associates \u2018concluded\u2019 that they would keep it to themselves. But football coaches don\u2019t get to decide whether schools investigate athletes for rape.\u201dAccording to the university\u2019s statement, Mr. Winston\u2019s lawyer \u201cinformed the athletics department that the police had dropped the investigation.\u201d Based on that information, and accounts given \u201cby the athlete and two others who had witnessed the encounter,\u201d athletic officials made the decision that no inquiry was warranted.At times, the university\u2019s statement underscores inconsistencies in the case. The Tallahassee police have said publicly that they had not dropped the case \u2014 only temporarily suspended it \u2014 and according to police records, detectives at the time knew nothing about the two witnesses, both friends of Mr. Winston\u2019s. One of them, Mr. Winston\u2019s roommate, took a video of the encounter, only to discard it before the police could examine it. On Friday, as The Times was preparing to publish this article, the university sent an open letter to the Florida State community, laying out the university\u2019s timeline of events and defending its handling of the case. In response to questions from The Times, university officials said they had fully informed federal investigators six months ago about the athletic department\u2019s knowledge of the sexual-assault allegation in January 2013. The officials said they were limited in what they could say publicly about the case because of privacy laws, and declined to make athletic department officials or Mr. Winston and other team members available for interviews. Mr. Jansen also declined to discuss the case. As The Times reported last April, the Tallahassee police also failed to aggressively investigate the rape accusation. It did not become public until November, when a Tampa reporter, Matt Baker, acting on a tip, sought records of the police investigation. Upon learning of Mr. Baker\u2019s inquiry, Florida State, having shown little curiosity about the rape accusation, suddenly took a keen interest in the journalist seeking to report it, according to emails obtained by The Times.\u201cCan you share any details on the requesting source?\u201d David Perry, the university\u2019s police chief, asked the Tallahassee police. Several hours later, Mr. Bonasorte, the senior athletic department official, asked Chief Perry if the requester was a sportswriter. The chief did not know. At 7:59 the next morning, a city official informed the chief that Mr. Baker was in fact a sports reporter. By 11 a.m., the athletic department had tracked down his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Might the Tallahassee police try to block the report\u2019s release on legal grounds? Mr. Bonasorte wanted to know. \u201cI will talk to Jimbo, if released or not,\u201d he said, in an email to Chief Perry. TMZ, the gossip website, also requested the police report and later asked the school\u2019s deputy police chief, Jim L. Russell, if the campus police had interviewed Mr. Winston about the rape report. Mr. Russell responded by saying his officers were not investigating the case, omitting any reference to the city police, even though the campus police knew of their involvement. \u201cThank you for contacting me regarding this rumor \u2014 I am glad I can dispel that one!\u201d Mr. Russell told TMZ in an email. The university said Mr. Russell was unaware of any other police investigation at the time of the inquiry. Soon after, the Tallahassee police belatedly sent their files to the news media and to the prosecutor, William N. Meggs. By then critical evidence had been lost and Mr. Meggs, who criticized the police\u2019s handling of the case, declined to prosecute. Only after the end of Florida State\u2019s national championship season did the university, having begun a disciplinary inquiry, attempt without success to interview Mr. Winston. Seven more months would pass before the school interviewed his accuser, who had long since dropped out. Mr. Winston has acknowledged having sex with his accuser, but said it was consensual. He will cooperate with the university\u2019s disciplinary inquiry, which the university said Friday would be conducted by an independent hearing officer. Abuse Call to 911The 911 call came at 3:10 a.m. A man and a woman were fighting outside an apartment complex three miles north of the Florida State campus. The caller, a neighbor, asked the police to hurry. He said the man was grabbing the baby, punching the mother and trying to block her from driving away. \u201cHe jumped behind the truck, and she tried to run him over,\u201d he said. It was not the first time the couple had fought, the caller said, adding, \u201cYou can constantly hear them screaming.\u201d In two minutes, the Tallahassee police were on the scene. Officer Paul Donaldson later summed up what they had learned in a three-paragraph report: The man and woman were inside talking, not yelling. He was holding their baby. During an earlier argument, she had tried to leave their apartment, taking the baby with her, but he objected. Both calmed down and went back inside. \u201cThere was no bruising or evidence of a battery,\u201d the police report stated, calling the complaint \u201cunfounded.\u201d Because police departments have historically treated complaints of domestic violence less seriously than other violent crimes, many departments have adopted clear investigative protocols, some of them codified in state laws. But since the officers decided that this was not a case of domestic violence, they avoided having to follow those protocols and their own department policies, according to police records and interviews with domestic violence experts.Over all, the police appear to have done little investigating. Officer Donaldson\u2019s report contains no indication that the police interviewed any witnesses or obtained written statements, nor did he give a reason for failing to do so. Because the 911 caller said the altercation occurred outside, the police could have attempted to examine video from security cameras fixed throughout the apartment complex, but the report includes no mention of it.\u201cThe training that I have seen on domestic violence, not just in Florida but nationally, certainly you would want to see if there were any witnesses,\u201d said Nina Zollo, legal counsel to the Florida Coalition Against Domestic Violence. \u201cSo based on the 911 call, there was a witness. That is pretty basic domestic violence training for officers.\u201dFlorida law states that whether or not an arrest is made, officers must clearly indicate in their report that \u201cthe alleged offense was an incident of domestic violence.\u201d They must then send the report to the designated domestic violence crisis center. The department spokesman, Officer Northway, said the case was correctly reclassified as a \u201cdomestic disturbance\u201d because officers had determined that it was only a \u201cverbal argument.\u201d After viewing the police report, provided by The Times, the director of the designated crisis center in Tallahassee, Refuge House, said she believed that the episode should have been classified as domestic violence, with the report sent to her office. \u201cRefuge House has raised its concerns about this report to T.P.D. and is awaiting a full response,\u201d the director, Meg Baldwin, said in a statement.Ms. Baldwin said the episode pointed to broader concerns about domestic abuse involving Florida State football players. \u201cVictims of domestic violence at the hands of F.S.U. football players have come to us, believing that they can\u2019t go to police, can\u2019t get an injunction safely, can\u2019t complain to F.S.U., can\u2019t be seen anywhere near the F.S.U. victim advocate office, and face enormous risk to their safety, alone with an attacker who is physically massive and habituated to physical aggression,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of these victims even filed a police report.\u201dIn the January case, the officers may have been less than diligent in their investigation, but there was one item they did not neglect: notifying their supervisor, Sgt. David McCranie, \u201cdue to the fact that it was an F.S.U. football player.\u201dThe sergeant was recently demoted after running two red lights and hollering at state troopers while off duty. He said he got carried away because he was excited about Florida State winning a big softball game against Michigan. \u201cWhere I was, everybody was whooping and hollering,\u201d he told internal affairs investigators. \u201cThe streets were busy.

{"Headline": "Dilma Rousseff Emerges as Front-Runner in Brazil\u2019s Election but Faces Runoff", "Date": "2014-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe strong showing by Mr. Neves, a senator from the state of Minas Gerais, enabled him to surpass Marina Silva, an environmental leader who soared in opinion polls in September, only to be eliminated from the race.Ms. Rousseff got 41.5 percent of the vote, against 33.7 percent for Mr. Neves and 21.3 percent for Ms. Silva, electoral officials said, with 99 percent of votes counted.Mr. Neves, a leader of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, which put in place an economic stabilization program when it held power from 1995 to 2002, has criticized Ms. Rousseff for a scandal at Petrobras, the national oil company. The episode involved a former executive\u2019s revealing a huge overbilling scheme intended to support political figures in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s governing alliance.But Ms. Rousseff\u2019s emphasis on protecting gains in living standards, along with spending on attack ads, helped fortify her campaign over the past two months. Many voters expressed concern that rivals could disassemble the web of antipoverty programs begun by the Workers Party, and those worries eclipsed resentment over corruption.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of corruption in the government, but there\u2019s corruption in every government,\u201d said Lu\u00eds Carlos Silva, 47, a waiter at a restaurant in downtown Rio de Janeiro.He emphasized that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s party, which has been in power since 2003, had helped many poor Brazilians ascend to the middle class, especially in Cear\u00e1, his home state in northeast Brazil.\u201cLife has improved with Dilma,\u201d Mr. Silva said, referring informally to the president by her first name, a common practice for politicians in Brazil.The election has been followed closely throughout Latin America, with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government supporting leftist allies in Venezuela and Cuba. The campaigning has also fueled volatility in financial markets as big investors expressed anxiety over some of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s policies, which have expanded the influence of big state companies in the economy.Mr. Neves, 54, has signaled that he would put in place policies aimed at calming the markets, like easing controls on fuel prices and improving the transparency of public finances. A top adviser of his campaign is Arm\u00ednio Fraga, a Princeton-trained former central bank president who now operates an investment firm based in Rio.But missteps by Ms. Silva, like backtracking on support for same-sex marriage and offering vague descriptions of how she could reshape Brazil\u2019s political institutions, sowed confusion among voters, and she lost ground as the election neared.\u201cTruthfully, none of the candidates are great,\u201d said Lucio Claudio de Souza, 49, who runs a newsstand in Bras\u00edlia.Still, he said he believed that Mr. Neves would crack down on crime more effectively than other candidates, pointing to a proposal to lower the age at which minors can be tried as adults to 16.\u201cI think A\u00e9cio is the least worst,\u201d he said.Reflecting Brazil\u2019s consolidation of democracy since military rule ended in 1985, voting in the elections unfolded largely without problems across the country, the Brazilian news media reported. Voters also chose governors and legislators in the election.Mr. Neves\u2019s Social Democracy Party bolstered its support in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest state, but lost ground to the Workers Party in his home state of Minas Gerais.While Brazilian elections generally proceed without major claims of irregularities, fatigue and disenchantment among voters are also on the rise. For instance, a majority of the electorate wants an overhaul of legislation making it mandatory in Brazil for people between the ages of 18 to 70 to vote.Ms. Silva tried to tap into that sentiment with a diffuse message of \u201cnew politics.\u201d\u201cOf all the candidates, Marina is the only one who really represents a renovation,\u201d said Carlos Alberto Ferreira, 62, a pensioner who works as a security guard at a parking lot to supplant his meager retirement income. \u201cShe talks directly to the people.\u201dThe race between Ms. Rousseff, a former leftist guerrilla, and Mr. Neves, whose grandfather was elected president in 1985 but fell ill and died before he could take office, suggests that polarization could grow more acute. The two represent rival ideologies, with Ms. Rousseff hewing to state capitalism and Mr. Neves contending that the state\u2019s role in the economy should be reduced.Pointing to Ms. Silva\u2019s new role as a potential kingmaker in the election, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former president and a supporter of Mr. Neves, starkly told reporters on Sunday what needs to happen now if their party is to unseat Ms. Rousseff.\u201cMarina needs to come over to our side,\u201d he said.An article on Oct. 6 about the results of the Brazilian presidential election that forced the incumbent, Dilma Rousseff, into a runoff gave an outdated title for Eduardo Campos, a rival candidate who was killed in a plane crash in August. At the time of his death, he was a former governor of Pernambuco, not still holding office.Mariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Lucy Jordan from Bras\u00edlia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Living Wages, Rarity for U.S. Fast-Food Workers, Served Up in Denmark", "Date": "2014-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnthony Moore, a shift manager at a Burger King in Tampa, Fla., earns $9 an hour, typically working 35 hours a week and taking home around $300 weekly.COPENHAGEN \u2014 On a recent afternoon, Hampus Elofsson ended his 40-hour workweek at a Burger King and prepared for a movie and beer with friends. He had paid his rent and all his bills, stashed away some savings, yet still had money for nights out.That is because he earns the equivalent of $20 an hour \u2014 the base wage for fast-food workers throughout Denmark and two and a half times what many fast-food workers earn in the United States.\u201cYou can make a decent living here working in fast food,\u201d said Mr. Elofsson, 24. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to struggle to get by.\u201dWith an eye to workers like Mr. Elofsson, some American labor activists and liberal scholars are posing a provocative question: If Danish chains can pay $20 an hour, why can\u2019t those in the United States pay the $15 an hour that many fast-food workers have been clamoring for?\u201cWe see from Denmark that it\u2019s possible to run a profitable fast-food business while paying workers these kinds of wages,\u201d said John Schmitt, an economist at the Center for Economic Policy Research, a liberal think tank in Washington.Many American economists and business groups say the comparison is deeply flawed because of fundamental differences between Denmark and the United States, including Denmark\u2019s high living costs and taxes, a generous social safety net that includes universal health care and a collective bargaining system in which employer associations and unions work together. The fast-food restaurants here are also less profitable than their American counterparts.\u201cTrying to compare the business and labor practices in Denmark and the U.S. is like comparing apples to autos,\u201d said Steve Caldeira, president of the International Franchise Association, a group based in Washington that promotes franchising and has many fast-food companies as members.\u201cDenmark is a small country\u201d with a far higher cost of living, Mr. Caldeira said. \u201cUnions dominate, and the employment system revolves around that fact.\u201dBut as Denmark illustrates, companies have managed to adapt in countries that demand a living wage, and economists like Mr. Schmitt see it as a possible model.Denmark has no minimum-wage law. But Mr. Elofsson\u2019s $20 an hour is the lowest the fast-food industry can pay under an agreement between Denmark\u2019s 3F union, the nation\u2019s largest, and the Danish employers group Horesta, which includes Burger King, McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks and other restaurant and hotel companies.As a shift manager at a Burger King near Tampa, Fla., Anthony Moore earns $9 an hour, typically working 35 hours a week and taking home around $300 weekly.\u201cIt\u2019s very inadequate,\u201d said Mr. Moore, 26, who supervises 10 workers. His rent is $600 a month, and he often falls behind on his lighting and water bills. A single father, he receives $164 a month in food stamps for his daughters, 5 and 2.\u201cSometimes I ask, \u2018Do I buy food or do I buy them clothes?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cIf I made $20 an hour, I could actually live, instead of dreaming about living.\u201dMr. Moore\u2019s daughters receive health care through Medicaid, while he is uninsured because he cannot afford Burger King\u2019s coverage, he said.\u201cI skip the doctor,\u201d he said, adding that he sometimes goes to work sick because \u201cI can\u2019t miss the money.\u201dBurger King declined to discuss wages or benefits, saying those decisions were made by its franchise operators. The company said that its \u201crestaurants have provided an entry point into the work force for millions of Americans,\u201d and that the Burger King McLamore Foundation gave some employees emergency financial assistance and college scholarships.Mr. Schmitt, the economist, acknowledged that it would take some time for the American fast-food industry to adjust to higher wages.\u201cWe would need to phase this in,\u201d said Mr. Schmitt, who is co-editor of the book \u201cLow-Wage Work in the Wealthy World.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve created a low-road economy, and it\u2019s going to take us some time to build up the speed to get onto the high road.\u201dIn Denmark, fast-food workers are guaranteed benefits their American counterparts could only dream of. Under the industry\u2019s collective agreement, there are five weeks\u2019 paid vacation, paid maternity and paternity leave and a pension plan. Workers must be paid overtime for working after 6 p.m. and on Sundays.Unlike most American fast-food workers, the Danes often get their work schedules four weeks in advance, and employees cannot be sent home early without pay just because business slows.Given the benefits available, Mr. Elofsson, the Burger King employee in Copenhagen, said he hoped to make his career with the company and work his way up to restaurant manager. While the Danish industry does not keep data on worker retention, HMSHost Denmark, which runs the fast-food operations at Copenhagen Airport, estimates that 70 percent of the workers at its Burger King and Starbucks franchises stay for more than a year.Danish law does not require fast-food companies or their franchisees to adhere to the wages required by the agreement with the 3F union. But they do, because employees and unions pledge in exchange not to engage in strikes, demonstrations or boycotts. \u201cWhat employers get is peace,\u201d said Peter Lykke Nielsen, the 3F union\u2019s chief negotiator with McDonald\u2019s.McDonald\u2019s learned this the hard way. When it came to Denmark in the 1980s, it refused to join the employers association or adopt any collectively bargained agreements. Only after nearly a year of raucous, union-led protests did McDonald\u2019s relent.In interviews, Danish employees of McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and Starbucks said that even though Denmark had one of the world\u2019s highest costs of living \u2014 about 30 percent higher than in the United States \u2014 their $20 wage made life affordable.True, a Big Mac here costs more \u2014 $5.60, compared with $4.80 in the United States. But that is a price Danes are willing to pay. \u201cWe Danes accept that a burger is expensive, but we also know that working conditions and wages are decent when we eat that burger,\u201d said Soren Kaj Andersen, a University of Copenhagen professor who specializes in labor issues.Measured in Big Macs, McDonald\u2019s workers in Denmark earn the equivalent of 3.4 Big Macs an hour, while their American counterparts earn 1.8, according to a study by Orley C. Ashenfelter, a Princeton economics professor, and Stepan Jurajda, an economics professor at Charles University in Prague.And the Danish restaurants are less profitable. With fast-food wages in the United States so much lower than in Denmark, and the price of Big Macs in the two countries similar, Mr. Ashenfelter said, \u201cIt must be that U.S. McDonald\u2019s are far more profitable.\u201d The higher wages and the higher menu prices help explain why there are 16 McDonald\u2019s per million inhabitants in Denmark, but 45 McDonald\u2019s per million in the United States, Mr. Jurajda said.McDonald\u2019s declined requests for detailed financial data for its restaurants. But it said in a statement that the countries where it operates \u201chave significantly different cost structures, economic environments and competitive frameworks.\u201d The company added that it and its franchise operators \u201csupport paying valued employees fair wages aligned with a competitive marketplace.\u201dAmerica\u2019s restaurant industry predicts a wave of woe if pay were to jump toward Denmark\u2019s levels. An increase to $15 would \u201climit employment opportunities\u201d by making fast-food restaurants reluctant to hire, said Scott DeFife, an executive vice president at the National Restaurant Association. \u201cMore than doubling the starting wage will dramatically increase costs in an industry that exists on very narrow margins.\u201dDenmark\u2019s high wages make it hard, though not impossible, to maintain profitability at his restaurants, said Martin Drescher, the general manager of HMSHost Denmark, the airport restaurants operator.\u201cWe have to acknowledge it\u2019s more expensive to operate,\u201d said Mr. Drescher. \u201cBut we can still make money out of it \u2014 and McDonald\u2019s does, too. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be in Denmark.\u201dHe noted proudly that a full-time Burger King employee made enough to live on. \u201cThe company doesn\u2019t get as much profit, but the profit is shared a little differently,\u201d he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t want there to be a big difference between the richest and poorest, because poor people would just get really poor,\u201d Mr. Drescher added. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people living on the streets. If that happens, we consider that we as a society have failed.\u201dLiz Alderman reported from Copenhagen and Steven Greenhouse from New York.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Says That He Is \u2018Proud to Be Gay\u2019", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Cook is taking that advice. On Thursday, he said he was gay \u2014 the most striking example of how he is in many ways making Apple a more open, less secretive company.Countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have laws that punish homosexuality. In China, the site of many of the factories that produce Apple gadgets, there are no legal protections for gays and lesbians, and the government occasionally cracks down on rights advocates.On Chinese social media, some homophobic jokes made the rounds, and Mr. Cook\u2019s sexuality ranked as the top issue on China\u2019s Twitter-like microblog Weibo. Users alternately supported Mr. Cook or hit out at homosexuality. The chief executive of the antivirus and search engine company Qihoo 360, Zhou Hongyi, joked by questioning whether Chinese tech leaders would imitate Mr. Cook and come out of the closet, just as so many copy Mr. Jobs\u2019s style of presentation.Still, it seemed unlikely that consumer interest in Apple products or its business partnerships in Asia would be damaged.At home, Mr. Cook\u2019s decision to be public about his sexual orientation typified how Apple has changed under his three years of management. The culture of secrecy Mr. Jobs fostered, with considerable success, also extended to his personal life, about which he was notoriously guarded. For years, he resisted pressure to disclose details of his health, even as he became visibly ill.That stands in remarkable contrast with Mr. Cook, who seemed driven by personal beliefs rather than any sort of business needs in his decision to acknowledge what was already well known in Silicon Valley.If Mr. Jobs\u2019s larger-than-life persona defined Apple for many years, Mr. Cook\u2019s more down-to-earth personality is increasingly defining Apple in an era when it is the most valuable tech company in the world and easily one of the most influential companies in the United States.While Apple remains secretive about its products, Mr. Cook has been far more vocal about issues like the environment and human rights, and how the company\u2019s products interact with the gear made by other firms. Apple\u2019s willingness to work with other companies is a timely change given that it, like others in the industry, must learn to play nice with smaller outfits so they can be the nerve center of increasingly complex home computing networks.Within the tech industry, Mr. Cook\u2019s essay was generally lauded. Silicon Valley, with its nonstop focus on the future and its location in one of the most socially liberal parts of the country, has long been publicly supportive of gays and lesbians. Major tech companies field large contingents in San Francisco\u2019s annual gay pride parade, with some industry leaders, including Facebook\u2019s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, and Mr. Cook, personally leading their companies\u2019 marchers.The Valley has also been ahead of the curve in extending employee benefits to same-sex partners and spouses. But tech companies, particularly start-ups founded and staffed largely by young white men, have struggled to deal with a fraternitylike workplace atmosphere inhospitable to women and gay people. Silicon Valley has few prominent executives who are openly gay.\u201cThank you Tim for showing what it means to be a real, courageous and authentic leader,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on his social network as he shared Mr. Cook\u2019s essay with his followers.Rob Glaser, chief executive of Real Networks, a maker of media player software in Seattle, said in an interview that Mr. Cook\u2019s step was \u201chugely positive.\u201d\u201cLife is about role models,\u201d said Mr. Glaser, who has worked in the tech industry for three decades. \u201cIf you\u2019re a 14-year old kid and you find the C.E.O. of one of the most iconic companies in the world happens to be gay, you\u2019ll think, \u2018There\u2019s no limit on what I can do.' \u201dHe said some of his gay friends still felt uncomfortable coming out and believed the industry discriminated against them. Mr. Cook\u2019s public disclosure of his sexual orientation could help defuse the issue, he added.Mr. Cook has been outspoken on gay rights for some time, though he has always stopped short of saying he himself was gay. Last year, for example, at an event on human rights hosted by Auburn University in Alabama, his alma mater, Mr. Cook said he had suffered discrimination in his own life but did not elaborate.Earlier this week, Mr. Cook criticized the state of Alabama at a speech in Montgomery for being too slow to protect the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. He deplored the fact that people can still be fired for their sexual orientation in the state.The sexuality of an executive has not had any visible effect on businesses in some other industries, like retail. Glen T. Senk, the former chief of Urban Outfitters, which owns the retail chain Anthropologie, is openly gay and said his sexuality did not have a visible effect on the company.\u201cI made a very conscious decision that if someone didn\u2019t like it, they wouldn\u2019t shop at Anthropologie,\u201d he said. \u201cI never had the sense that it ever hurt Anthropologie or Urban Outfitters.\u201dMr. Cook\u2019s decision comes at a high point for Apple. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., recently reported strong financial results, thanks to booming sales of its latest iPhones. Mr. Cook has guided the company into the intriguing new wearable technology market with the Apple Watch. Apple\u2019s shares are trading near a record high.Samsung Electronics, Apple\u2019s top competitor in smartphones, recently reported steep declines in profit because of shrinking smartphone sales.\u201cThis is a golden moment for Apple,\u201d said Tero Kuittinen, a managing director for Frank N. Magid Associates, a technology research company. \u201cSamsung looked a lot scarier a year ago.\u201dBen Bajarin, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies, said that even though a vocal group of people disliked Apple, those sentiments had never had any meaningful impact. He said he expected Mr. Cook\u2019s coming out to similarly have no impact on Apple\u2019s business, even if people did not approve of his being gay.Reporting was contributed by Conor Dougherty, Mike Isaac, Steve Lohr and Natasha Singer from New York; Matt Richtel from San Francisco; Nick Wingfield from Seattle; Paul Mozur from Hong Kong; Shanshan Wang from Beijing; and Mark Scott from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Beggars of Lakewood", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Ehrlich has made a circuit of yeshivas in Israel\u2019s religious cities, like Jerusalem and Bnei Brak, offering his Yinglish patter to pious students in exchange for a few shekels. About 12 years ago, he was working the grounds of the Mir, a large school in Jerusalem that is popular with Americans studying abroad, when somebody suggested that he travel to Lakewood, where American students at the Mir often settled on their return home. So began his annual pilgrimage. Often he raises money for friends who have to pay for a child\u2019s wedding (and takes a cut for himself). This year, one of his 12 children was marrying in July, and Lakewood helped pay for the banquet. Soon after we met, I asked Ehrlich what he earned in New Jersey each year. He told me, but made me promise not to say exactly how much. Put it this way: After costs, he earns more than enough to buy a Honda Fit, but not quite enough for a Civic.The yeshiva students may not give much, but nearly all of them give \u2014 and there are so many of them. Between 1990 and 2010, Lakewood\u2019s population doubled to about 92,000 residents, largely because of the growth of its ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. Conveniently located equidistant from New York City and Philadelphia, Lakewood is home to Beth Medrash Govoha, the nation\u2019s largest yeshiva. The school, founded in 1943 by the refugee Rabbi Aharon Kotler, has seen its student body swell to about 6,500, making it just smaller than Harvard College. The growing Orthodox movement encourages young men to forgo or postpone higher education for religious study, and the yeshiva has benefited from that. Other schools have followed suit, setting up shop in Lakewood. Most students are married, and families with five or 10 children are common.Numbers like these have helped the American Orthodox community explode in recent years. Lakewood, which sits about 10 miles from the Jersey Shore and 80 miles south of Manhattan, was once a WASPy summer village. It\u2019s now at least half Jewish, and the newcomers here have created an economy centered on the things they need that almost no one else does. They work in kosher restaurants and markets, religious elementary and secondary schools and haberdashery and dressmaking shops. The critical mass of stores catering to Jews, many with bilingual Yiddish- or Hebrew-speaking staffs, draws still more people. Orthodox bankers, mortgage brokers and insurance salesmen serve a community that knows nothing of the real estate bust. But this separate and booming religious economy comes with a rider: itinerant beggars like Ehrlich. Hundreds every year.Lakewood is becoming a medium-size city, but in many ways, it\u2019s a pre-World War II European village, right down to the Yiddish and, to an extent, the clothes. The spiritual ecology of the town revolves around the Torah, which obliges that all Jews, even those who are in need themselves, give to charity. And so Lakewood \u2014 full of broke students, most likely at the peak of their adherence to Jewish law \u2014 has given full expression to the generous tendency of small, diasporic communities, which can be amplified when they find a little piece of the world to call their own.It\u2019s not that Lakewood residents enjoy having their doorbells rung two, three or four times a day to hear a hard-luck story. But while other towns may criminalize beggars or tell them to move along, Lakewood has an obligation to fulfill \u2014 Jews are literally family, according to the Torah. So the town came up with a modern solution to an ancient problem: paperwork. Beggars are registered and licensed in Lakewood, as a means of preserving trust in this community that aspires to be a village but is outgrowing that label.The volunteer there would not talk with me, but a week later, I had a telephone conversation with a different, longtime volunteer, who asked that I not use his name. He told me that Orthodox communities have always had a rabbi or leader who vets out-of-town beggars; he was sure that Lakewood was not the first to set up a formal office. Still, he said, his organization was originally quite controversial. To inquire about people\u2019s motives for begging struck many in town as somehow un-Jewish.\u201cHow do you say somebody\u2019s not legitimate, not deserving?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho decides? How strict are you?\u201d But the town realized that an organization like this was necessary, he said, because \u201clike any good system, people abuse the system.\u201d Some beggars would come back often, telling dubious stories, preying on people\u2019s generosity. Tomchei Tzedakah was founded eight years ago in response, and initially it turned many people away. \u201cOnce word got out that you\u2019re not going to get away with it in Lakewood,\u201d he told me, the schemers stopped coming. Now, he said, they turn away no more than 2 or 3 percent of those who apply.Many visitors are raising money for acquaintances or institutions, often in Israel. In such cases, Tomchei Tzedakah does some rudimentary fact-checking. \u201cIf they say they have 600 students,\u201d the volunteer said, \u201cwe verify the school has 600 students.\u201d It also calls references back home, usually a rabbi. At the same time, it functions as a concierge to the indigent, suggesting restaurants that will give them food and residents who might offer a place to sleep. It embodies the community\u2019s dual impulse, to be exceedingly generous while not being taken for chumps.Greenspan said that when he lived near the yeshiva, before he moved, the knocks were constant. \u201cFour or five times a day,\u201d he said. I asked how much he gave. \u201cOne dollar, two dollars. People who I can\u2019t give to, I offer them a cup of water or juice. If it\u2019s a Friday afternoon\u201d \u2014 the Sabbath approaching \u2014 \u201cI give them a piece of kugel.\u201dWith their large families and limited job skills, the ultra-Orthodox have high poverty rates. The predominantly Hasidic village of Kiryas Joel in Orange County, N.Y., is the poorest town with more than 10,000 residents in the country. Many of the Jewish poor do accept forms of public assistance like food stamps. Yet many of them are forced to rely on their more fortunate neighbors, who conveniently live among them. When Roberts began giving away money, word spread, and suddenly he \u201ccouldn\u2019t go anywhere or do anything.\u201d People asked for money at the supermarket, at the clothing store, everywhere. \u201cOur lives were torn apart. The phone was ringing continuously \u2014 I mean continuously.\u201d Beggars cornered him in parking lots and interrupted him at prayer in the synagogue. The knocks at his door were \u201cconstant,\u201d he said. \u201cNine in the morning, 9:02, 9:05, 9:07, noon.\u201d His heart \u201cwould break for these people,\u201d he said \u2014 everyone had a story, most of them probably true. Still, he wanted his life back.But leaving Lakewood was not an option. \u201cOther wealthy people, they move out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not what we do.\u201d So several years ago, he instituted a new policy: He would respond to only requests made in handwritten letters. Now he and his secretary sit down once a week and write about 30 checks, \u201cabout $50 to $100\u201d each, and \u201csome a lot larger,\u201d he said. \u201cI probably also write a $20,000 check every week.\u201d People still come to the door, but less often. He gives everyone who knocks two $1 bills from a pouch in a cabinet by his front door. \u201cI have a few thousand dollars of ones upstairs,\u201d he said.I asked Schreiber how he made sure the food bank wasn\u2019t taken advantage of. \u201cWe don\u2019t ensure,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly God ensures.\u201d But then he admitted that God needed a little help to figure out who\u2019s truly needy. \u201cWe interview families, we get references \u2014 the schools, the rabbis, neighbors, whoever\u2019s involved \u2014 and get a good picture,\u201d Schreiber said. \u201cWe\u2019re not the I.R.S. We don\u2019t have their tax returns on the table.\u201dBut tax returns aren\u2019t necessary. The cost of admission to this world of generosity is privacy. Even the beggar\u2019s application asks for the name of a home rabbi \u2014 and he will get a call, even back in Jerusalem. Lakewood is a town that defeats anonymity. For out-of-towners reduced to knocking on doors, the price of all this charity is, as everywhere else, uncomfortable exposure. For locals, there is an effort to preserve dignity \u2014 but even then, the system presumes that there\u2019s always someone who can attest to the family\u2019s dire need.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain warmth and trust to it,\u201d Kotler said. \u201cIn a big city, in Manhattan, you see indigent people collecting on the street. That doesn\u2019t feel as dignified as this. Here, a person knocks on the door. And tells you their story.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking Upmarket in Iceland's Capital", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKOPAVOGUR, Iceland \u2014 The sleek white house on Gnitakor, a street of upmarket homes in suburban Reykjavik, is something of a specialty item.It is one of 15 homes listed with a local real estate agency for more than 100 million Icelandic krona, about $824,000. And industry observers say the eye-catching Functionalist home is much more likely to attract offers now than it would have been five years ago, when the country\u2019s economy was still suffering from the 2008 financial crisis.Iceland\u2019s housing market is now thriving, especially in the capital of Reykjavik and the surrounding metropolitan area, where roughly two-thirds of the country\u2019s 323,000 citizens live, said Hannes Steindorsson, an agent and co-owner at Re/Max Lind in Kopavogur, Iceland\u2019s second-largest city and part of the capital region. \u201cThe price of homes has slowly been going up year by year and, actually, in a lot of neighborhoods, we have already passed the highest prices before the crisis,\u201d he said.Prices are highest in central Reykjavik, where new properties cost roughly 500,000 krona per square meter, or $385 a square foot, and existing apartments average about two-thirds of that, Mr. Steindorsson said. In outlying areas such as Kopavogur, which in English means \u201cseal pup bay,\u201d prices are lower, though a housing shortage is pushing up values.The two-story, 416-square-meter, or 4,800-square-foot, house on Gnitakor was designed by Bjorgvin Snaebjornsson, architect of the landmark Hilton Reykjavik Nordica. Mr. Steindorsson said the owners of the seven-bedroom home, built in 2007, wanted to downsize. They listed it at 140 million krona about five months ago.The concrete house has a zinc roof and an exterior coating to protect it from the country\u2019s harsh winters and salt air. Inside is a minimalist interior of sweeping white surfaces and pale oak floors in an open-plan layout, enhanced by vaulted ceilings and large picture windows. The lighting system features programmable settings that range from low-and-moody to turned-up-bright for cleaning, and Bang & Olufsen speakers are installed in the living room, kitchen and the wraparound balcony, which has views of the nearby Greenland Sea, the Blue Mountains and the Reykjavik cityscape.Iceland has geysers, volcanoes and hot springs that produce cheap heat and hot water for 90 percent of the country\u2019s homes. In this house, a thermal under-floor system with individual room controls keeps winter heating bills at less than the equivalent of $100 a month, Mr. Steindorsson said, while the living room has a remote-controlled gas fireplace for atmospheric warmth. The back garden includes a deck of Siberian larch with a Jacuzzi.While such a property is within the financial reach of few buyers, and loans are harder to secure than before the economic crisis, the market is active. The number of sales \u201chas gone up 20 percent for the last three years in a row, and the prices have gone up 7 to 15 percent a year\u201d in the same period, said Gunnar Valsson, another Re/Max Lind agent. The growth is mostly the result of pent-up demand after a four-year pause in construction during the financial crisis, Mr. Valsson said: \u201cThere simply are more buyers than sellers.\u201dIceland\u2019s property market is dominated by local buyers, with fewer than 10 percent of Re/Max Lind\u2019s sales involving foreigners \u2014 and the same is true at other agencies, the Re/Max agents said.In 2011, Chris Jagger, who is British, and his Icelandic wife bought a historic home in Reykjavik\u2019s trendy 101 district. The couple paid about 30 million krona for the three-story house, which had been seized by a bank following the crash. The couple felt the house was a little overpriced but they fell for its charms: It was built in 1903 and expanded in both the 1920s and 1980s, and a renowned jazz musician had lived there, as had Iceland\u2019s first openly gay woman. Recently the house, which has had some extensive renovation, was valued at a third more than they paid for it, Mr. Jagger said.\u201cFor me personally, I find living in such an old house in this particular location extremely inspiring,\u201d said Mr. Jagger, who teaches critical and creative thinking. \u201cAlthough in comparison with most other capitals Reykjavik is tiny, it has all the energy and life of a larger city.\u201dCitizens of European Union and European Economic Area countries can buy property in Iceland without restriction; other foreigners must have government approval to buy homes or land, according to the Ministry of the Interior\u2019s web site. The Central Bank of Iceland, seeking foreign capital, has tried to entice real estate investors to participate in a series of currency auctions. Anyone willing to risk a 25,000 euro, or $32,000, minimum investment will receive the Central Bank\u2019s official exchange rate for a portion of their cash while the remainder would be put up for auction, with the possibility of earning a more favorable rate. To discourage quick resales, also called flipping, investors must hold the properties they buy for five years. To date, most of the auction program participants have been Icelandic citizens living abroad who are seizing the chance to get a good deal on an investment property to rent to tourists, said Asgeir Jonsson, an associate economics professor at the University of Iceland who was chief economist at Kaupthing Bank, Iceland\u2019s largest bank before the collapse. \u201cThere has been a very good business in buying and then renting out small flats,\u201d he said. Tourist visits to Iceland have tripled since 2000, rising an average of about 8 percent per year to more than 800,000 in 2013, according to a report by the Icelandic Tourist Board, and the country is poised to welcome more than one million foreign visitors in 2015.As for the housing shortage, Mr. Jonsson notes that nearly 50 percent of Iceland\u2019s population is younger than 34 and that most young people enter adulthood expecting to own a home. \u201cWhat we are seeing now is that generation coming into the labor market and the housing market and they are having trouble getting their own homes and flats,\u201d he said.Building costs in Iceland traditionally are high, and the weak krona has led to premiums on new construction. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any forests at all, so we have to import all lumber and also metals and concrete,\u201d Mr. Jonsson said. Still, the housing situation has room for growth, Mr. Steindorsson said. \u201cThe banks, in their reports, they think that prices will go up for at least two or three years more,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that, no one really knows.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trains Move Oil Bonanza, Delays Mount for Other Goods and Passengers ", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 An energy boom that has created a sharp increase in rail freight traffic nationwide is causing major delays for Amtrak passenger trains and is holding up the transport of vital consumer and industrial goods, including chemicals, coal and hundreds of thousands of new American cars, rail officials and federal and state regulators say.American rail lines now move more than a million barrels of oil a day, much of it from the Bakken shale oil field in North Dakota and Montana and from the oil sands of Alberta, Canada. Last year about 415,000 rail cars filled with crude oil moved through the United States, compared with 9,500 in 2008, according to the Surface Transportation Board, a bipartisan body with oversight of the nation\u2019s railroads.In large part as a result, long-distance Amtrak passenger trains are now late 60 percent of the time, Amtrak officials said, compared with a year ago, when the trains were late 35 percent of the time.The problems are particularly acute on long-distance passenger lines like the Empire Builder, which shares tracks with freight traffic from Chicago to Portland, Ore., and is late nearly 70 percent of the time. Trains on the 47-hour trip typically run three to five hours behind. Revenue from the line has dropped 18 percent from last year, Amtrak officials said, as word about the sluggish service spread among passengers, most of whom use the Empire Builder for shorter trips between cities on the route.\u201cClearly, we\u2019re not getting the level of service that we want to give, or what our customers have been used to getting over the last decade,\u201d said Edward R. Hamberger, president and chief executive of the Association of American Railroads, an industry trade group. Delays are not as serious for rail service along the Northeast Corridor, where Amtrak owns most of the track between Washington and Boston and has more control over passenger service. On long-distance routes, Amtrak passenger trains run on tracks owned by the major freight railroads.On the long-distance routes, aging tracks and a shortage of train cars, locomotives and crews have also caused delays, rail officials said. In addition, an improving economy has meant more goods shipped by rail over all. Rail accounts for 40 percent of all goods moved in the country as measured in ton-miles, derived by multiplying a cargo\u2019s weight by the distance shipped. Trucks are second at 28 percent.A proposed pipeline to move oil from Canada would alleviate some of the rail congestion but would not eliminate it, officials said.Although North Dakota has been known within the industry for a surge in moving oil by rail, and resulting delays in grain shipments for farmers, rail officials say the congestion and late passenger trains have spread to many other states. On Wednesday, the Surface Transportation Board announced that the nation\u2019s largest railroads must file public weekly reports about their performance, which the board said would give rail customers a better sense of the magnitude of the delays.The problems are only expected to get worse. American coal exports to countries like China, which are picking up as domestic demand falls, will also compete for space on trains, as new coal export terminals are planned at several ports in the Pacific Northwest. (Increased Asian demand for coal reached record levels in 2012 and continues to be high.) In the United States, a record harvest of corn, soybeans and wheat is expected this year, adding to the stress on the nation\u2019s rail network.\u201cIt\u2019s like having a fire hydrant hooked up to a garden hose,\u201d said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soybean Transportation Coalition in Iowa.Railroad executives say they are working to unclog the congestion. Michael J. Trevino, a spokesman for the Burlington Northern Santa Fe line, owned by Warren Buffett, said the company had committed $5 billion for rail expansion and track maintenance to help improve its service.The money includes about $300 million over the next three years to improve capacity and beef up the rail system in North Dakota, which Burlington Northern Santa Fe said would bring 300 more employees to the state and lead to smoother operations and faster deliveries. Mr. Trevino said B.N.S.F. was also making improvements to its tracks in Missouri that carry coal trains coming from Montana and Wyoming.Thomas L. Lange, a spokesman for Union Pacific Railroad, said the company was buying about 229 new locomotives and hiring about 3,200 additional train crews to help deal with the increase in demand for service.\u201cWe\u2019ve had some delays in our system because demand for freight rail transportation for Union Pacific surged in 2014 to unexpected levels, which we have not seen since 2006,\u201d Mr. Lange said. \u201cWe\u2019re upgrading and expanding our system to make sure that at the end of the day, we get the goods delivered.\u201dA major speed bump in the nation\u2019s rail congestion is Chicago, a transit point for six of the nation\u2019s seven biggest railroads. Nearly half of what is known as intermodal rail traffic \u2014 the big steel boxes that can be carried aboard ships, trains or trucks \u2014 travels through the city. The congestion in Chicago is also caused by track sharing among freight, Amtrak and commuter trains.The railroads and local, state and federal officials have committed $3.2 billion for 70 construction projects to replace rail intersections with overpasses and underpasses, in an effort to smooth the flow of traffic for the 1,300 freight and passenger trains that travel through Chicago each day. The project will also separate tracks now shared by freight and passenger trains at critical spots. Officials said about 22 of the projects had been completed.In total, railroads will spend about $26 billion this year to upgrade the rail network and hire new workers, said Mr. Hamberger of the Association of American Railroads.Despite the improvements, many industries say they still suffer delays. In April, the auto industry said it had more than 200,000 new cars in storage because of a shortage of trains to move the vehicles.\u201cSince the summer, we are seeing progress, but automakers are entering the fall with a backlog of new cars to transport by rail,\u201d said Gloria Bergquist, vice president of communications for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the auto trade group. About 70 percent of new vehicles are moved by rail, according to the group. Industry officials say they are moving more cars by truck as a result of the rail congestion. But trucks are a more expensive method of moving the cars, a cost that may eventually be passed on to customers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Key to Exports: Liquid Gas", "Date": "2014-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEnergy Special SectionNew methods of producing natural gas are expected to turn the United States from an importer into a large exporter in less than a decade, assuming that the gas can be exported in sufficient quantities cheaply enough to compete on world markets.That is likely to happen, industry authorities say, because the technology for liquefying gas \u2014 essential for taking it across oceans \u2014 also continues to improve, making the process more economically efficient and environmentally safer. With exports virtually nil now, the Energy Department forecasts shipments abroad of liquefied natural gas equivalent to two trillion cubic feet by 2020, roughly 7 percent of expected domestic production. Target markets would be Western Europe and Asia, where gas costs more to produce.Basic liquefaction is not all that creative. Natural gas, or methane, is compressed by forcing it through turbines in several steps until it becomes dense and cold enough \u2014 minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 162 Celsius) \u2014 to turn into a liquid.But each facility must conform to an idiosyncratic set of circumstances that affect how the process is carried out: its geography and topography, the amount and quality of gas \u2014 pure natural gas is methane, but much of what comes out of the ground contains impurities of one sort or another that have to be cleansed \u2014 and where the gas is going and how it is going to get there. All else being equal, bigger is almost always considered better when it comes to liquefying gas.But a necessary one. Turning methane into a liquid conveys several advantages, especially for transporting over long distances. Liquefied gas occupies about one six-hundredth the space as the same quantity does in gaseous form, and it is nontoxic and nonflammable.There are various benefits to shrinking gas in an expansive way. One refrigeration unit, called a train, costs $2 billion or more. But as a plant installs more trains (so called because they are narrow and tend to be arranged sequentially), they become cheaper because the high cost of planning, engineering and construction is spread out over more units, and supplies can be sourced cheaper in larger quantities. The cost to build other parts of liquefaction facilities \u2014 storage tanks, jetties where ships are loaded, the initial planning, site preparation and so forth \u2014 is also spread out.Once a plant is open, more trains mean lower operating expenses because the plant can be put to fuller use. Having two trains instead of one cuts the cost of liquefying each cubic meter of gas by nearly 30 percent, Mr. Bullock said, and plants can have up to eight trains \u2014 which should further lower expenses.Further cost reductions are accruing, people in the industry say, because the efficiency of the liquefaction process is increasing as technology is enhanced. \u201cEfficiency has improved big time in the last 10 years,\u201d said Luca Maria Rossi, general manager for turbomachinery solutions at G.E. Oil & Gas, part of General Electric.The compressors that liquefy gas run on gas themselves. A decade ago, about 70 percent of the energy used in the process was lost through heat dissipating into the air, Mr. Rossi said. The figure has dropped to 60 percent, and he expects it to reach 50 percent within a few years. Burning less gas makes the process cheaper and also cleaner, he added, because less carbon dioxide and other pollutants are released.Liquefying gas more cheaply is essential because higher commodity prices and greater global demand for facilities, as well as demand to build them on more remote terrain, is driving up construction costs.\u201cFor a long time there was a downward trend in costs, as train size and plant size got larger and you had economies of scale,\u201d said Amos Avidan, corporate manager of engineering and technology for Bechtel, which builds liquefaction facilities. \u201cWith escalation around the world, a similar facility costs two to three times what it did 10 years ago.\u201d He noted that construction is generally cheaper for American plants because they tend to be in locations with easier access.Mr. Campbell at Stratas highlighted two competing design trends that are influencing costs, one to make plants the same, the other to make them different. Some exporters are moving away from \u201cworld-scale terminals,\u201d he said, and creating smaller facilities to ship gas to smaller markets like Central America and the Caribbean. As for full-size facilities, he said, companies are trying to cut costs by relying more on modular construction techniques, standardizing the specifications of trains and other elements so they can be replicated for similar sites with similar terrain.\u201cThat should allow us to do things more efficiently,\u201d Mr. Avidan said. \u201cThe revolution in technology is enabling us to change the work process, and we\u2019re just at the beginning of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

During their talks last week, both men spoke of their democracies as natural partners, an idea that every president since Bill Clinton has tried to capitalize on, with limited success. To address the challenges before them, including a rising China, Mr. Obama and Mr. Modi are going to have to work harder, so relations don\u2019t atrophy or become more strained. The meeting produced some agreements, including renewal of a 10-year defense cooperation agreement, a promise to cooperate on maritime security as China presses claims in Asian waters, and several clean energy initiatives. The leaders pledged support for Afghanistan and efforts against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and the Pakistani Taliban. But there was no sign of progress on such strategic concerns as how to curb the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan and limit chances of another war with Pakistan over Kashmir or between India and China over their border. There remain, too, serious questions about whether Mr. Modi, a Hindu nationalist who was denied an American visa after the 2002 sectarian killings in Gujarat when he was chief minister there, will defend the rights of all Indians. While Mr. Modi expressed concern over the Islamic State, he did not sign up for the coalition led by the United States. And there was no mention of solutions on the differences with Washington on Ukraine and Iran. Estranged during the Cold War, India and the United States have much to gain from collaboration.

{"Headline": "Ideology and Investment", "Date": "2014-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerica used to be a country that built for the future. Sometimes the government built directly: Public projects, from the Erie Canal to the Interstate Highway System, provided the backbone for economic growth. Sometimes it provided incentives to the private sector, like land grants to spur railroad construction. Either way, there was broad support for spending that would make us richer.But nowadays we simply won\u2019t invest, even when the need is obvious and the timing couldn\u2019t be better. And don\u2019t tell me that the problem is \u201cpolitical dysfunction\u201d or some other weasel phrase that diffuses the blame. Our inability to invest doesn\u2019t reflect something wrong with \u201cWashington\u201d; it reflects the destructive ideology that has taken over the Republican Party.And the mismatch between desired saving and the willingness to invest has kept the economy depressed. Remember, your spending is my income and my spending is your income, so if everyone tries to spend less at the same time, everyone\u2019s income falls.In a direct sense, much of the fall in public investment reflects the fiscal troubles of state and local governments, which account for the great bulk of public investment. These governments generally must, by law, balance their budgets, but they saw revenues plunge and some expenses rise in a depressed economy. So they delayed or canceled a lot of construction to save cash.Yet this didn\u2019t have to happen. The federal government could easily have provided aid to the states to help them spend \u2014 in fact, the stimulus bill included such aid, which was one main reason public investment briefly increased. But once the G.O.P. took control of the House, any chance of more money for infrastructure vanished. Once in a while Republicans would talk about wanting to spend more, but they blocked every Obama administration initiative. And it\u2019s all about ideology, an overwhelming hostility to government spending of any kind. This hostility began as an attack on social programs, especially those that aid the poor, but over time it has broadened into opposition to any kind of spending, no matter how necessary and no matter what the state of the economy.Never mind that the economic models underlying such assertions have failed dramatically in practice, that the people who say such things have been predicting runaway inflation and soaring interest rates year after year and keep being wrong; these aren\u2019t the kind of people who reconsider their views in the light of evidence. Never mind the obvious point that the private sector doesn\u2019t and won\u2019t supply most kinds of infrastructure, from local roads to sewer systems; such distinctions have been lost amid the chants of private sector good, government bad.And the result, as I said, is that America has turned its back on its own history. We need public investment; at a time of very low interest rates, we could easily afford it. But build we won\u2019t. Charles M. Blow is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Luxury Condos: Dialing It Down", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe developer Adam Gordon, who converted the Bouwerie Lane Theater into luxury condominiums and created a boutique building rising in West Chelsea with an $18 million penthouse, is taking a break from constructing apartments. Instead, he is spending his time at a cattle ranch he bought for his family in Sonoma, Calif., and concentrating on his storage facilities business. \u201cResidential development has gotten too risky; it is just not a good bet,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cA lot of the guys who are staying in the game now are gamblers, and I\u2019m just not one of them.\u201d A great deal of hubbub has surrounded the luxury real estate market in Manhattan in recent months. Seemingly every week prices reach new heights \u2014 the latest is a triplex penthouse on Park Avenue that is listed for $130 million \u2014 and bidding wars have become so common as to be unexceptional. Yet, what was once just a whisper among a few dissenters is now a chorus, with market experts increasingly concerned that too many luxury apartments are being built and there are not enough buyers willing to pay for them. In the past year, the number of luxury apartments listed for sale in Manhattan essentially doubled. In the third quarter, 1,473 luxury apartments were on the market, compared with just 742 units in the third quarter of last year, an increase of 98.5 percent, according to the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.The company defines luxury as the top 10 percent of the market, or listings for $3.25 million and higher; superluxury as the top 5 percent, currently around $5 million and higher; and ultraluxury as the top 1 percent, anything starting at around $10 million. As a result of this growing supply at the top end of the market, developers like Mr. Gordon are packing up their tools and pulling out, while some others are reconfiguring their projects to focus on smaller units with lower prices. If the trend holds, the supply of condos coming to market in two to three years will look very different from what is for sale now \u2014 with many fewer apartments priced at $10 million and up.Some buyers, meanwhile, are growing jittery and in some cases, backing out of deals altogether for fear they have overpaid. \u201cRight now we are in the beginning of a transition market,\u201d said Stuart N. Siegel, the president of Engel & V\u00f6lkers New York Real Estate. \u201cWe are transitioning away from unfettered pricing to what will be a healthier marketplace, with more discipline in pricing and valuation.\u201d With so much new inventory, well-heeled buyers have more choices and are growing more finicky. \u201cIn a recent sales meeting, every one of my agents had either heard about or had personally dealt with an accepted offer that didn\u2019t go into contract,\u201d Mr. Siegel said. \u201cThe wildebeests are stopping at the cliff edge.\u201dMr. Siegel described it as \u201ca little bit of buyer\u2019s remorse, or just concern that they are buying at the top of the market.\u201d The developer Aby Rosen is hoping to draw buyers to a new condominium he and partners are building at 610 Lexington Avenue in Midtown by eschewing sprawling mansion-size apartments for smaller, more modestly priced units \u2014 at least relative to the upper reaches of the market.\u201cWe are not going to do full-floor monsters,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cWhy compete with the $30 million apartments? Let other people do that and have a good time \u2014 or bad time \u2014 with their sales.\u201dMarketing at the 61-story building will not begin until this spring. Mr. Rosen said that he planned a restaurant on the ground floor and above, a mix of studios and one- and two-bedrooms priced in the $8 million to $10 million range. \u201cWhat we think is the next wave of buyer is a guy who lives in Beijing but wants a one- or two-bedroom apartment, not a four- or five-bedroom apartment,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cIt is still going to be very expensive, still super high end, but the percent of spaces that can sell for $20 or $30 million is very small. Our goal is to have 2,000-square-foot one-bedrooms, with lavish wonderful spaces. Time will tell, but I think we are on the right track.\u201d John Gomes, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman, is advising his developer clients to follow a similar strategy. \u201cDevelopers are so hyper-focused on bigger apartments with high-end finishes because you can charge astronomic prices,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a huge hole in the market for smaller apartments, and many more people who want to buy them.\u201d Mr. Gomes is recommending that developers be more efficient with layouts. \u201cWhat used to be a 650-square-foot studio can now be a very well-laid-out one-bedroom,\u201d he said. For new condominiums like 50 Clinton Street, a project on the Lower East Side where WD-50, the restaurant run by the chef Wylie Dufresne, now stands, he said, \u201cI\u2019m dubbing a new term, \u2018cool luxury,\u2019 where the building is super design-focused, but it doesn\u2019t use the most high-end finishes or appliances.\u201d \u201cThe developer wanted to build a handful of larger apartments with double-height spaces and very high price points,\u201d he said. \u201cI told him that rather than building 20 units, he should build 30, and reconfigure the apartments so there are more conventional smaller units that will cost less and appeal to a broader demographic.\u201dBut while some developers are shifting gears, the demand for certain high-end buildings has not abated.In September, 104 contracts were signed for Manhattan apartments at $4 million and above, according to the Olshan Realty Company. This is the highest monthly total since Olshan began tracking the data in 2007, and caps a record third quarter, which posted a 19 percent increase over the same period last year.The two partners are now building Steinway Hall, a skyscraper approximately 1,400 feet tall at 111 West 57th Street, along a billionaires\u2019 row of ultraluxury towers in various stages of construction. \u201cThere is a lot of concern about supply,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cBut very few luxury condos have over 100 units, with most between 50 and 100 units and many just eight or 10 apartments. True, Steinway Hall is going to be a very tall tower, but it only has 60 apartments.\u201d One is the photographer Mario Testino, who is purchasing a three-bedroom for $7.75 million, according to Dennis Mangone, a broker at Douglas Elliman who is representing the project. The building, priced at close to $4,000 a square foot, recently raised its prices. It has a 2,219-square-foot unit for $7.6 million, a 2,234-square-foot unit for $8.15 million and a 4,234-square-foot penthouse for $18.75 million.\u201cDo I wish I could have come to market a year ago? Sure,\u201d Mr. Schrager said. \u201cBut if you make a distinct product that is special, as I think I do, you are somewhat insulated from the vagaries of the economy.\u201d Mr. Schrager is also in the planning stages for a 45-unit condominium project on Leroy Street and West Street in the West Village. The project likely won\u2019t be built for another year or two, and will include a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, with the largest around 2,200 to 2,400 square feet. Mr. Schrager said he is not paying too much attention to potential market shifts, although he isn\u2019t planning any massively sized units. \u201cI always thought it was counterintuitive to do large units because the price point gets so high,\u201d he said. He is also being judicious when choosing amenities. \u201cI\u2019m wary of amenity creep,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere there are all these amenities thrown at the buyers, and they never get used.\u201dAt one point, for example, it was suggested to Mr. Schrager that the Leroy Street project include a laundry room specifically designed for washing duvet covers, an idea he nixed. \u201cIt feels like the market should be turning, that\u2019s just what I feel instinctually,\u201d Mr. Schrager said. \u201cBut who knows? It could be six months or six years.\u201d If the luxury market begins to downshift, it would be a natural progression in the real estate cycle, said Rosemary Scanlon, the divisional dean at the New York University School of Professional Studies Schack Institute of Real Estate. During the last market peak around 2006, developers were building 30,000 to 35,000 units of housing a year in New York City, she said. \u201cWhen the financial crisis hit, leading to the great recession and the drying up of financing, developers were only building around 4,000 or 5,000 units of housing,\u201d she said. While supply dried up, demand remained strong in New York, keeping pressure on rentals and the resale market. As a result of this unceasing demand \u2014 helped in part by New York\u2019s perpetual shortage of housing stock \u2014 developers began building again. \u201cIt started with luxury housing, but now it is spilling over into the more upper- and middle-income ranges,\u201d Ms. Scanlon said. \u201cNext, we will begin to see more development of affordable units.\u201d That phase, of course, is a priority for Mayor Bill de Blasio.\u201cReal estate is always cyclical,\u201d Ms. Scanlon said, \u201cAnd what it sounds like we are seeing now is the next stage in the cycle.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Bank of Japan\u2019s Surprise Move Means for the Global Economy", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyOne central bank giveth, and another taketh away.The Bank of Japan\u2019s new action took markets by surprise and drove a 4.8 percent gain in the Japanese stock market and smaller gains across the globe. It also offers a reminder \u2014 or perhaps a warning \u2014 of just how hard it will be to get the global economy out of its deflationary funk. And a cycle of bad political decision-making, across many countries, is the reason.The back story is this: At the start of 2013, a new government came into power in Japan, led by Shinzo Abe, promising a series of aggressive measures to jolt the Japanese economy out of its long period of stagnant growth and falling prices. A crucial part of that strategy was the appointment of Mr. Abe\u2019s handpicked central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, who promised to do whatever it took to get inflation up to 2 percent in Japan.The initial results were promising. In early 2013 the yen fell on currency markets, and the Japanese stock market rose sharply. For the first time in two decades, there was palpable buzz around Japan\u2019s economic prospects, both inside the country and around the world. \u201cAbenomics\u201d became a household term, at least in households that are interested in international economics.But since then, neither the rest of the world, nor the rest of the Japanese government, has done much to help Mr. Kuroda.Within Japan, the fiscal authorities raised a consumption tax this year, aiming to rein in budget deficits in a country with the highest public debt in the world relative to the size of its economy. That created a steep economic contraction in the second quarter, weakness that persisted through the summer.Meanwhile, Europe has dithered as its economy has ground to a halt, and many major emerging economies have slowed. With the rest of the world slowing down and supplies of oil and many other raw materials rising, the price of most major commodities has fallen sharply since the summer.So Mr. Kuroda faced slumping Japanese economic growth because of decisions his own government made and downward pressure on prices due to things that happened in the rest of the world. The credibility of his promise to do whatever it took to get to 2 percent inflation was in doubt.Hence the surprise move Friday. It was a close call \u2014 the vote on the bank's policy committee was 5 to 4, not like the unanimity of Mr. Kuroda\u2019s earlier tenure. But the theater of it may have been helpful in the psychological aspect of persuading people in Japan that their central bank really is serious about getting higher inflation, and that citizens should make their spending and investment decisions accordingly. Inflation expectations tend to be self-fulfilling.But while it is nice to see boldness from one of the world\u2019s leading central banks \u2014 a sharp contrast with the sluggishness of the European Central Bank in responding to dire threats to the eurozone economy \u2014 the move does underscore a broader problem that has haunted the global economy the last several years.Central banks have been the only players in town trying to boost global growth. In the United States, Congress from 2011 to 2013 ignored the pleas of Ben Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, to avoid sharp spending cuts that would depress growth. Right now, the German government is said to be furious at the E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi, for his calls for more public spending by Germany and other financially strong European nations. And the Bank of Japan is now facing a harder job because of the Japanese parliament\u2019s eagerness to raise consumption taxes.In each case, the central bank has gotten little support from its government in trying to encourage growth, and carried more of the burden itself, often in the form of yet more quantitative easing, which has tended to sharply boost asset prices in the financial markets but has had much more questionable effects on job creation and wages.We\u2019ve gotten used to central bankers with names like Kuroda, Bernanke, Yellen and Draghi being the primary actors trying to get the global economy on track. Their job would be much easier if their counterparts holding elected office showed the same enthusiasm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Asks Rich Nations for Support", "Date": "2014-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The International Monetary Fund, showing heightened concern over a slowing world economy, said on Tuesday that cash-rich countries like Germany needed to step up large public investments to help keep the flagging global recovery on track.The comments \u2014 from the fund\u2019s managing director and its lead economist \u2014 reflect growing concerns within the I.M.F. that Germany, which recently passed China as the country with the largest trade surplus in the world, is not doing enough to spur growth in Europe.In an interview on Friday, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the fund, said global growth risked being stuck in a rut for a long time. \u201cIf nothing gets done in a bold way, there is a risk of a new mediocre\u201d level of growth for the global economy, she said.And she took note that Germany could do more to stoke growth in Europe. \u201cGiven Germany\u2019s current position, it could certainly spend more on infrastructure,\u201d she said.The fund\u2019s growth worries were underscored on Tuesday when Germany said that orders for industrial goods in August shrank by the largest amount since 2009, plunging 4 percent on a month-over-month basis.For investors, the warnings in the I.M.F. forecast and the report from Germany helped send the broad stock market down sharply on Tuesday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index falling 1.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq each fell about 1.6 percent. The I.M.F. brought its estimate for global growth this year down to 3.3 percent from 3.7 percent and reduced its forecast for 2015 to 3.8 percent. The fund pointed to weaker growth in China, Europe, Japan and Latin America \u2014 Brazil in particular \u2014 as the main culprits behind the broad retrenchment.Germany\u2019s growth forecast for 2014 was cut sharply to 1.4 percent from 1.9 percent. Its estimate for United States growth in 2015, 3.1 percent, outpaces all major industrialized countries and exceeds as well a number of emerging markets, which in theory are supposed to grow at a substantially more rapid clip.The assessment reflected a broad acceptance by global investors that, at least for the near future, the United States economy was set to advance ahead of many large economies, not just in terms of growth but also in corporate profitability and international competitiveness.As a result, large investors and central banks have become aggressive purchasers of the dollar, betting that the currency will keep rising in value against the euro, the yen and the wobbly currencies of countries like Russia, Brazil and Turkey.Economists have been warning for some time now that a situation in which the American economy becomes the prime engine for the global recovery brings with it significant risks by creating financial uncertainty in emerging markets as currencies weaken and capital flows reverse.\u201cAt this stage, the question is, can the U.S. continue to power along while the rest of the world acts as a drag on global growth,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international finance at Cornell University and the author of a recent book on the dollar. \u201cThis is a very unbalanced recovery.\u201dFund economists expect annual growth in the eurozone of just 0.8 percent, with inflation coming in at 0.9 percent \u2014 a figure that Ms. Lagarde raised pointed concerns about. \u201cWe\u2019ve been warning for over a year now about persistent low inflation, and frankly we faced a bit of denial \u2014 everyone said we don\u2019t need to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s there.\u201d\u201cInfrastructure investment, even if debt-financed, may well be justified,\u201d Olivier Blanchard, the fund\u2019s senior economist, said at the news conference on Tuesday.And while he did not mention Germany by name, he left little doubt to whom he was broadly referring. \u201cEurozone countries should be ready to do more,\u201d Mr. Blanchard said. Mr. Blanchard pointed out that with interest rates at modern-day lows \u2014 Germany can borrow money for 10 years at below 1 percent \u2014 taking on extra debt to stimulate the economy need not be seen as profligacy.He offered up a brief economic primer to underscore his point. \u201cIt is an irony of macroeconomics,\u201d he said with a small smile, \u201cthat for countries with too much debt, sometimes the solution is to create more debt.\u201dMr. Blanchard, who oversees economic research at the I.M.F., was behind the fund\u2019s public recognition two years ago that heavy-handed austerity policies in Europe had a larger-than-expected impact on economic growth. Now, it seems, the global watchdog seems to be going one step further by urging eurozone officials to relax their rigid austerity measures. Both Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Blanchard also made it clear that they had their doubts about the two-year bull run in eurozone government bonds.Ms. Lagarde, in the interview, said that there was a \u201cdisconnect between what\u2019s happening in markets and, on the other hand, progress in the real economy.\u201d Mr. Blanchard said that the markets \u201cwere too complacent\u201d and that policy makers should be especially watchful. \u201cThe risk is there,\u201d he cautioned.The tough tone may well reflect a sense within the fund that this time around it needs to be more forceful in warning of financial trouble spots before it is too late.The fund has repeatedly cautioned that investors have become too reliant on very loose monetary policies on the part of global central banks to bolster their returns.Wholesale purchases of bonds by monetary authorities have inflated equity and bond markets in countries around the world where investments were minimal and growth subpar, economists for the fund said in the report.The warning echoes a rising chorus from economists and regulators who say that when the Federal Reserve in the United States starts raising interest rates \u2014 expected to begin in 2015 \u2014 so-called hot money flows that sought out high-yielding but risky returns in Europe and in emerging markets, including China, will head for safer shores.A consequence could be a broad disruption in financial markets, similar to but greater in scope than the market spasm that hit markets in the developing world earlier this year.Landon Thomas Jr. reported from Washington, and Liz Alderman from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Sell Consumer Spending Short, a Report Says", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBuying OptimismAn article, published in the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019s Monthly Labor Review, dismissed warnings that stalled incomes, changing demographics and tighter credit could make consumer spending less capable of powering the economy. By examining the relationship between consumer spending and jobs during the Great Recession and into the future, the bureau projected that spend-happy Americans would continue to account for more than 70 percent of the country\u2019s total output and more than 63 percent of the nation\u2019s jobs in coming years.And where will those jobs come from? Primarily in the field of health. Labor-intensive industries like health care are expected to generate more than half the jobs that are tied to consumer spending. The sector expected to suffer the deepest job losses is manufacturing. No surprise there, but job growth in pretty much every other sector, from retail sales to government, will generally remain flat, the report said.When it comes to economic growth, many economists have long maintained that consumer spending is the engine. Yet just how many jobs can be directly attributed to consumption? That\u2019s the question bureau economists tried to answer. Looking back at the worst years of the Great Recession, they noted that of the nearly 8.7 million jobs lost between 2007 and 2010, about 3.2 million, or just over 36 percent, were a result of the drop in consumer spending. Not since the end of World War II had spending dropped so sharply.But as the report noted: \u201cIn comparison with the overall economy, consumer spending and its related employment declined less severely and recovered sooner.\u201d The resilience of fields like health care, social assistance and educational services is the reason; they weathered the recession better than a lot of other industries. \u201cConsumers still need vital goods and services like food and shelter during economic downturns even as some businesses entirely shut down,\u201d the report explained.Still, as the recovery continues, some economists have worried that the lopsided reliance on consumer spending is not healthy, and that the United States should seek to reduce that dependence. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened because business investment has been pretty moderate,\u201d Michael Gapen, Barclays\u2019s chief United States economist, explained.That moderate pace is a concern for economists who believe the most vigorous and sustainable growth is tied to business investment \u2014 whether in physical plants and machinery, in the work force through education and training, or in ideas and technology.Mr. Emmons, not surprisingly, said he, too, found it overly optimistic to think that consumer spending would grow at the same steady-though-slow rate as the economy.The bureau estimates that by 2022, consumers will be spending $12.4 trillion to support nearly 95 million jobs, up from more than 85 million today. That\u2019s a growth rate of 2.6 percent, slower than in the past, but in step with the overall economyNot many of the jobs are going to be in manufacturing, though. It\u2019s not that consumers don\u2019t like American goods; in recent decades, they\u2019ve actually increased the amount of money they\u2019ve spent on them. The problem is that those sales have not translated into manufacturing jobs.As the population ages, Americans will end up spending more and more of their dollars on services. According to the report, more than 90 percent of new jobs will be in the service industry, with the remaining growth concentrated in the construction industry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Upside of Lower Oil Prices", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe price of crude oil has fallen roughly 25 percent since a peak in June, but whether that\u2019s good news or bad depends on where you stand. It\u2019s bad for members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other nations and governments that rely heavily on oil exports because their income has taken a huge hit. It\u2019s especially bad for Russia and Iran, which have relied on high oil prices to defy the United States and Western sanctions. It\u2019s bad for the environment because cheaper oil means fewer incentives to develop alternative and less carbon-intensive sources of energy.But it\u2019s not bad for Saudi Arabia, the kingpin of the global oil industry. Saudi Arabia has ample cash reserves to withstand a drop in income, shows no inclination to reduce production and seems to prefer putting a squeeze on its geopolitical rivals in Iran and Russia. For the United States, it\u2019s a mixed bag. American oil production is soaring, and lower prices could slow production of shale oil, which is expensive and needs higher prices to be profitable. But lower oil prices mean reduced costs for consumers and businesses and a boost for economies across the industrialized world. The large increase in American production is, in fact, one reason cited for the drop in prices. The other is a continuing slump in demand in Europe and other developed regions and slower growth in China. Characteristically, Russia has sniffed an American-led plot, with articles in the government press recalling how a sudden and sharp increase in Saudi production in 1985 caused prices to drop so low that the Soviet economy folded, followed by the Soviet state. All that will make for some heated debates at the next scheduled OPEC meeting in November. But regardless of whether the oil ministers decide to reduce production and nudge prices up, the fact is that oil prices will always rise and fall in response to geopolitical crises, economic trends and natural disasters. For now, it is enough to see petro-dictators at least temporarily humbled and forced to understand that oil riches do not give them license to bend the international order to their will. And it is good for industrial and developing countries to get some juice into their economies. But it is imperative that the United States and all other beneficiaries resist the temptation to use what could be a fleeting drop in prices to slow the search for alternative sources of energy. The planet, alas, does not have the resilience of oil prices. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Seeks Sanctions Tit for Tat ", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian Parliament on Wednesday took the first major step to authorize the Kremlin to seize foreign assets and use them to compensate individuals and businesses being hurt by Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.Legislation that passed its first round stands to arm the government of President Vladimir V. Putin with a remarkable weapon of retribution, effectively allowing the government to compensate the same insider businessmen and other elite who Western leaders had hoped would persuade the Russian leader to reverse course in Ukraine.Although its full parameters were still unclear and it faces several hurdles, the legislation has the potential to ensnare large multinational corporations that have invested heavily in Russia. Global companies like McDonald\u2019s, Pepsi and ExxonMobil hold tens of billions of dollars of assets in the energy-rich country.The sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and others in varying phases since March had been intended to bring Russia to heel. But Mr. Putin pushed back. In August, Russia announced that it would ban many imports of food and agricultural products from Europe and the United States.Russian news media have taken to calling the latest proposal the Rotenberg Law, after Arkady Rotenberg, a former judo-sparring partner of Mr. Putin, turned wealthy industrialist. Last month, the Italian authorities seized a reported $40 million in real estate, connected in part to Mr. Rotenberg, who has been sanctioned.After that, United Russia, a political party loyal to Mr. Putin, reintroduced the bill. It had first been rejected by the government last spring.The legislation must be approved two more times by the lower chamber of Parliament, or Duma, and the Russian senate, then signed by the president to become law. The initial passage could well be saber-rattling but is still an alarming sign that Russia will not take the sanctions lightly. Even early discussions of the rule in Parliament precipitated a stock sell-off late last month, given the stakes for international corporations.In the past, the Russian government has made no bones about taking apart private assets, dismantling the once-largest domestic oil company, Yukos, and jailing its former owner, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, for a decade. Last month, a court ordered another Russian billionaire, Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov, placed under house arrest.So far, those actions appear largely symbolic, with most McDonald\u2019s restaurants remaining open. Still, the symbolism was ominous. The opening of the first McDonald\u2019s restaurant in 1990 on Pushkin Square marked the dawning of a new era of post-Soviet business opportunities for Western corporations.PepsiCo first came to the former Soviet Union after offering a taste sample to the general secretary at the time, Nikita S. Khrushchev, in 1959. The company has invested heavily in Russia during the oil boom and now owns one of the country\u2019s largest dairies.Even without such rules, multinational companies are facing headwinds, as the country\u2019s economy flirts with recession. Ford has said weakening Russian demand for cars, amid all the uncertainty here, is hurting its global earnings. Yet other multinationals have inadvertently benefited from Russia\u2019s attempts to punish Western business. The ban on European dairy imports, for example, became an unexpected boon for Pepsi\u2019s local milk and yogurt business.The legislation, though, is amplifying corporate concerns. Russia\u2019s minister of economy, Aleksei Ulyukayev, said just last week that \u201cthere is no better way to create capital outflow than passing or even discussing such legislation.\u201dStill, the law passed with 233 votes in favor and 202 against. It would allow Russian citizens to who suffer from an \u201cunlawful court act\u201d of a foreign government to appeal for compensation in Russia, ultimately by seizing foreign assets here, even those covered by immunity such as diplomatic real estate.The Western sanctions were intended to dissuade Mr. Putin from invading Ukraine. The United States Treasury Department has called some of the targets the \u201cinner circle\u201d of Mr. Putin, or longtime acquaintances who would presumably have his ear.But the sanctions appear to have had an unintended consequence. Critics of the compensation law say this group of insiders instead used its position to lobby for a payout from the budget.\u201cI have never heard of anything more cynical,\u201d Boris Y. Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister and longtime critic of the Putin government, said of the law in a telephone interview. \u201cI call it the Rotenberg villa law,\u201d he added, in reference to the seized Italian real estate.Mr. Rotenberg, in an interview on Rossiya state television, denied he had lobbied for the law and said he would not seek compensation for his Italian real estate, now snared by sanctions. The law\u2019s intention is to shield Russian businesses, he said, dismissing the Italian seizure as the mere \u201closs of a house.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s a guide to 100 events that have us especially excited, in order of appearance.In a few short minutes, Mr. Amalric has introduced the kind of cinematic call and response \u2014 one in which a movie\u2019s sights and sounds comment on each other \u2014 that establishes that you\u2019re in the grip of a real director. It\u2019s exciting, although Mr. Amalric tends to move too fast for you to linger appreciatively over his filmmaking. The movie unfolds with the same terrific velocity as the Simenon novel, a short, savage work also titled \u201cThe Blue Room.\u201d In the opening sequence, for instance, there\u2019s a shot of Julien looking at Esther while framed in a mirror, his large eyes shifting when she asks if he loves her. He looks remarkably guilty. Not long after, the setting has moved from the blue room to somewhere rather less inviting, and the police are grilling Julien about his affair.The question of Julien\u2019s guilt teasingly winds through this movie, which doesn\u2019t so much ask who done it and why, but what happened. There is at least one crime in \u201cThe Blue Room,\u201d and that initial drop of bedroom blood grows into a metaphoric cascade, but far more pulse quickening is how Mr. Amalric, following Simenon\u2019s ingenious narrative lead, puts together the story\u2019s fragmented pieces. Julien, you soon discover, has been arrested and is being interrogated about a death. The initial glimpses of him and Esther making love in the blue room turn out to be flashbacks, much like illustrated memories, that he has summoned up during his different statements at different times and in different spaces to the police, a shrink (Blutch) and a judge (Laurent Poitrenaux).As \u201cThe Blue Room\u201d continues, and Julien\u2019s tribulations do, too, his remembrances flicker on and off the screen like a guttering flame, illuminating some events and obscuring others. (In moments, Julien\u2019s panicked eyes and rabbity physicality evoke Roman Polanski, another connoisseur of strange and ominous rooms.) Mr. Amalric\u2019s direction remains graceful through the story\u2019s violent turns, its mood changes and tone shifts. Notably, he also warms up Simenon\u2019s characters, in particular Julien, who on the page tends to register as a plot contrivance. On screen, Julien is many things \u2014 morally weak, terribly compromised, sometimes violent, often pathetic \u2014 but he\u2019s never less than human. And while his humanity makes him more recognizable it\u2019s also what makes him truly tragic.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Art Fair That\u2019s Less About Business", "Date": "2014-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the international collecting world descends on New York in early November for the fall contemporary auctions, most pretenses still left about the distinction between art and commerce tend to fade away: Value is measured in sales records and successive zeros.But one art fair opening to coincide with the auctions is trying hard to remind viewers of all the other ways to value art. The fair is doing so in part by making it very tough to tell that it is even a commercial enterprise, one in which hundreds of thousands of dollars of art will indeed be bought and sold.Independent Projects aims to take the antimall concept even further, inviting about 40 dealers from around the world to organize shows focused on single artists. After the first weekend, when the sales are made, the fair will continue to run for five more days as a kind of group exhibition, geared toward the public, with docents on hand.Ms. Dee recently sat down to talk about the rapidly shifting landscape for showing and selling art in the 21st century.Why not?For one, I think collectors are feeling increasingly overwhelmed with the scale of conventional art fairs. You walk into a space and there are over a hundred galleries and well more than a hundred artists. It used to be that when Art Basel was one of the only fairs that you would attend all year, you would have 10 days there to go through everything very carefully, go to the talks and lectures that were part of it, to develop a rationale about the artists you were following or which new ones you should be looking at. But to do that when every month or every other month you\u2019re at another major fair is a huge undertaking. All of this is basically a long way of saying that context is even more critical now because of the explosive growth of the art market. If a fair has a particular point of view, it\u2019s appreciated. It\u2019s conducive to collectors\u2019 interests and it becomes an experience, once again, about the art, rather than one of having to constantly sort through all of the information that needs to be considered.You\u2019ve talked about how the traditional 20th-century art-gallery model \u2014 dealers discovering artists, nurturing their careers slowly and carefully, and sticking by them \u2014 isn\u2019t working very well anymore, especially for midlevel galleries, as the pace of the market races and pressure on artists mounts. Have fairs contributed to that breakdown?The art world is now so big, there are multiple swim lanes in which people are operating. The one that\u2019s getting a lot of attention is the new model \u2014 which you could call the megagallery model \u2014 but the pressures on smaller galleries have to do with the larger economy beyond the art world and the costs involved, with all the fairs that one needs to do and with the international position one has to maintain. It was a little easier 10 or so years ago to think about artists and their careers and for the business side of the gallery to take up a much smaller percentage of your focus. That\u2019s not the case anymore because the cost of doing business has grown. The 20th-century model is still supportable, but you have to be very good at both the strategic side of your business and the strategic thinking for your artists.Who might be the Rosemarie Castoro of this fair?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Risks of Cheap Water", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIt will get worse. As climate change and population growth further stress the water supply from the drought-plagued West to the seemingly bottomless Great Lakes, states and municipalities are likely to impose increasingly draconian restrictions on water use.Such efforts may be more effective than simply exhorting people to conserve. In August, for example, cities and towns in California consumed much less water \u2014 27 billion gallons less \u2014than in August last year.But the proliferation of limits on water use will not solve the problem because regulations do nothing to address the main driver of the nation\u2019s wanton consumption of water: its price.\u201cMost water problems are readily addressed with innovation,\u201d said David G. Victor of the University of California, San Diego. \u201cGetting the water price right to signal scarcity is crucially important.\u201dThe signals today are way off. Water is far too cheap across most American cities and towns. But what\u2019s worse is the way the United States quenches the thirst of farmers, who account for 80 percent of the nation\u2019s water consumption and for whom water costs virtually nothing.Adding to the challenges are the obstacles placed in the way of water trading. \u201cMarkets are essential to ensuring that water, when it\u2019s scarce, can go to the most valuable uses,\u201d said Barton H. Thompson, an expert on environmental resources at Stanford Law School. Without them, \u201cthe allocation of water is certainly arbitrary.\u201d\u201cThere is enough water; we can live within our means,\u201d said Jim Lochhead, chief executive of Denver Water. \u201cBut the systems we have in place simply do not have enough flexibility to move water to the places where it is most needed.\u201dThe price of water going into Americans\u2019 homes often does not even cover the cost of delivering it, let alone the depreciation of utilities\u2019 infrastructure or their R&D. It certainly doesn\u2019t account for other costs imposed by water use \u2014 on, say, fisheries or the environment \u2014 caused by taking water out of rivers or lakes.Consumers have little incentive to conserve. Despite California\u2019s distress, about half of the homes in the capital, Sacramento, still don\u2019t have water meters, paying a flat fee no matter how much water they consume.Some utilities do worse: charging decreasing rates the more water is consumed. Utilities, of course, have little incentive to discourage consumption: The more they did that the more their revenues would decline.While this may seem a mess, it is nothing compared to the incentives facing American farms.Their water rights are primarily subject to state law. In the West, they have been allocated by a method that closely resembles \u201cfirst come first served.\u201d The first farm that drew water had a right to whatever it needed pretty much forever. Junior users \u2014 who arrived later \u2014 had to stand in line.Farmers pay if the government brings the water to the farm, say via an aqueduct from the Colorado River. But the fees are minimal. Farmers in California\u2019s Imperial Irrigation District pay $20 per acre-foot, less than a tenth of what it can cost in San Diego. And the government has often subsidized farmers via things like interest-free loans to cover upfront investments. (An acre-foot is the amount it takes to cover one acre of land a foot deep in water.)This kind of arrangement helps explain why about half the 60 million acres of irrigated land in the United States use flood irrigation, just flooding the fields with water, which is about as wasteful a method as there is. It also helps explain why underground water reserves declined by 53 million acre-feet between 2003 and 2014, about twice the volume of Lake Mead.This is hardly the only obstacle to conservation. A farm that doesn\u2019t use its full allotment of water risks forfeiting it for not putting it to \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d And any water saved automatically flows to other farmers with junior rights.Markets, and sensible pricing structures, are good at resolving these problems. Some water districts, like Irvine Ranch in California, have successfully introduced rising fee schedules: starting low for a basic allotment covering families\u2019 essential needs and rising quickly with volume to make people think twice about refilling the swimming pool.Spurred by the sense of crisis, incipient water markets show great promise. Santa Fe, N.M., has required builders to have water rights with their building applications since 2005 \u2014 giving farmers an opportunity to sell their rights to developers rather than using them for low-value crops.This isn\u2019t quite charging farmers for the water they use. But that may be a bridge too far, considering the tight margins of many farms and the political clout of many farmers.Still, markets such as those timidly emerging in the West could not only free water for the users who value it more, but they could also provide farmers with the revenue needed to invest in water management technology.The looming prospect of acute water scarcity demands a solution, however. It\u2019s not only the West\u2019s problem. Two years ago, the drought in the Midwest was as severe as the current drought in California. Lakes Michigan, Superior and Huron were at historic lows.Alternative solutions have been proposed \u2014 like towing icebergs from the Arctic or diverting water from the Missouri River to use on the other side of the Rockies. But the standard response to scarcity \u2014 grabbing more \u2014 cannot work any longer. There isn\u2019t more water to grab.Which means markets must play their part. \u201cWithout prices or trade,\u201d said Robert Glennon, an expert on water at Arizona University\u2019s College of Law, \u201cwe will just get more diversion of rivers, more dams and more wells.\u201d And nothing will be fixed.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Parliamentary Elections Show Political Turmoil Is Continuing in Ukraine ", "Date": "2014-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySVITLOVODSK, Ukraine \u2014 As two of Ukraine\u2019s best-known investigative journalists, Sergii Leshchenko and Mustafa Nayyem showed a boundless zeal for exposing corruption and hypocrisy at the highest levels of government. So it set heads spinning within the country\u2019s political and media elite last month when they suddenly announced that they were not only jumping the fence to run for Parliament, but also joining the establishment as candidates of President O. Poroshenko\u2019s coalition party. Or at least that\u2019s how it seemed. In a sign of how hard it can be to kick old habits, Mr. Leshchenko and Mr. Nayyem have spent the final week of the campaign not working to promote themselves, but rather crusading to defeat a candidate supported by their own party \u2014 a former official in the Kiev city government, whose front-runner status in this rural district 250 miles south of the capital, they say, was the result of corrupt back-room dealing approved by someone close to Mr. Poroshenko, if not by the president himself.\u201cWe want to demonstrate to society and to our political party at the same time that we are not going to tolerate this corrupt conspiracy,\u201d Mr. Leshchenko said, sitting in the passenger seat of a white S.U.V. with a large red decal that said \u201cStop Corrupt Politicians\u201d plastered on its front hood. Sounding genuinely torn, he added, \u201cThe most difficult part for us to accept was that we were going to fight against Poroshenko.\u201dThat such infighting would start so fast and so furiously \u2014 even before Sunday\u2019s vote \u2014 offers a glimpse of just how tumultuous politics remain in Ukraine eight months after the ouster of President Viktor F. Yanukovych, with a war against pro-Russian separatists still simmering in the east, hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes, Crimea annexed by Russia and an economy ever on the brink of collapse.For many supporters of the street protests that toppled Mr. Yanukovych, the elections were envisioned as a final step in transforming the government from an opaque kleptocracy beholden to the president, his oligarch backers and the Kremlin, to a transparent, reform-minded, pro-Western administration with a Parliament accountable to the people. The elections are also crucial to the United States and its European allies, which have staked enormous political and financial capital on Ukraine\u2019s future. Events here, however, suggest that transformation may take a lot longer.Ukrainian politics have long been dominated by big business interests, mainly the industrial titans known as oligarchs, who finance the campaigns of parties and candidates in exchange for influence within the presidential administration and for control of some seats in Parliament, called the Verkhovna Rada. The protests centered in Independence Square, known as Maidan, have not changed that \u2014 at least not yet.\u201cThe voting system is the same as it was two years ago,\u201d Mr. Leshchenko said. \u201cOligarchs in Ukraine did not give up after Maidan. They are still very influential players.\u201dThe ballot on Sunday includes fresh options, and the Parliament to be formed later this year is expected to reflect that. There is a new party called Self-Help, led by Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, the biggest city in western Ukraine, and Hanna Hopko, a young civic activist. Some previously obscure parties \u2014 like the populist Radical Party, led by a flamboyant lawmaker, Oleh Lyashko, and Civil Position, led by a former defense minister, Anatoly Hrytsenko \u2014 also have a chance of crossing the 5 percent threshold for forming a faction in Parliament.And there is an array of first-time, reform-minded candidates who had never intended on joining organized politics before the uprising last winter. Those include Mr. Leshchenko and Mr. Nayyem, who worked for the online news site Ukrainska Pravda, and Svitlana Zalishchuk, a television reporter who left journalism for civic activism before the protests started last fall and more recently led a coalition of government-reform groups pressing Parliament to make legislative changes.Half of the Parliament\u2019s 450 seats are filled by candidates from party lists, with the seats awarded proportionally based on the results of voting nationwide, while the other half are filled by direct election of candidates who run in individual districts, either with or without party endorsement. Independent candidates can choose later if they want to affiliate with a party, potentially winning more influence if they join the majority.The fight here in the central Kirovohrad region, on the west bank of the Dnieper River, is focused on a candidate named Oles Dovhyi, who was a former secretary of the Kiev City Council. His critics say he was responsible for a series of corrupt deals involving the sale of municipal land. Mr. Dovhyi tried to win a seat in Parliament from Kiev in 2012 but failed in part because the allegations against him were well known by city voters. Mr. Leshchenko and Mr. Nayyem said that friends of Mr. Dovhyi who are close to Mr. Poroshenko apparently cut a deal to let him run here in the Kirovohrad region, where his ancestors once lived.The critics of Mr. Dovhyi said they believed he was eager to join Parliament because he would then have immunity from prosecution, including any charges from an investigation into allegations first put forward in 2010 that he used his position to obtain ownership, together with business partners, of prime real estate near Kiev\u2019s landmark St. Sofia Cathedral. Mr. Leshchenko recounted details of the transactions in a recent blog post on Ukrainska Pravda. Mr. Dovhyi, who has denied wrongdoing in the past, did not return phone messages left for him on Saturday. In a last-ditch effort, Mr. Leshchenko, Mr. Nayyem and Ms. Zalishchuk deployed in force, hoping to tilt the election in favor of a local candidate named Andriy Lavrus. They expect to lose. Local residents said that supporters of Mr. Dovhyi have been buying votes for 200 hryvnias each, or about $15.At a rally here in Svitlovodsk on Thursday evening, the candidates from Kiev were joined by some local activists who urged voters to support Mr. Lavrus. \u201cBefore, we used to change old socks for old socks,\u201d Natalia Tashkevych, who coordinated antigovernment protests here last winter, told a crowd of perhaps 50 people. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to put on new socks!\u201dCorruption is the main but hardly the only challenge in the Ukrainian elections. The government has acknowledged that voting will be impossible throughout much of the embattled regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, which still remain partly under the control of pro-Russian separatists, as well as in Crimea, which Russia annexed in March. International observers expect as much as 10 percent of Ukrainian voters to be unable to participate. In a statement on Saturday, Mr. Poroshenko said the early parliamentary vote represented his fulfillment of a major campaign promise.\u201cIt\u2019s time to complete a full reset of power,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI have enough political will to implement the developed strategy of reforms. But I also need the majority in the Parliament. Reformist majority, not corrupt one. Pro-Ukrainian and pro-European, not pro-Soviet.\u201dWhile voter surveys have shown Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s bloc running at the head of the pack, the party is not expected to win a controlling majority and will have to form a coalition with one or more minority factions.Also jockeying for representation in the Parliament are two parties that include members of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions, which held the majority until he fled Ukraine: the Opposition Block and Strong Ukraine. And there are two parties that include a number of establishment politicians: Fatherland, led by the former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, and People\u2019s Front, led by the current prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk.Because of their place on the Poroshenko party list, Mr. Leshchenko, Mr. Nayyem and Ms. Zalishchuk are virtually assured of being elected. They acknowledged that relations could prove difficult not only with Mr. Dovhyi, if he wins, but also with the longer-serving politicians they once covered as journalists. They said an early goal would be an overhaul of election laws.\u201cWe would like to destroy the old political establishment from inside, the rules of the old political elite,\u201d Mr. Leshchenko said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do this, who is going to do it?\u201d He said he did not blame Mr. Poroshenko, who made a fortune in candy manufacturing, for the back-room deal, but would hold him responsible. \u201cJust because his name is on the top of the party, it is not his private property,\u201d Mr. Leshchenko said. \u201cThe party is not a confectionary. The party is an institution, which reflects society. I\u2019m grateful to Poroshenko because he created this internal competition.\u201dPolitical organizations are prone to corruption, he said, and the former journalists could help reverse that trend. \u201cIn this sense, Poroshenko needs us to control this from inside,\u201d he said. \u201cNow Poroshenko has us. He can say, \u2018Nothing personal, but these young journalists in my party will not tolerate this. I cannot accept this because it will destroy my party.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFor the first time in a long conversation, Mr. Leshchenko smiled. \u201cI like this role.\u201dDaniel Rzhenetskyy contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine.Advertisement"}

A report earlier in the day from the Commerce Department showed that retail sales dropped 0.3 percent last month, the first such decrease since January.Walmart\u2019s woes are also forcing a change in corporate strategy. Walmart will slow store openings in the United States next year, opening 60 to 70 supercenters, compared with 120 this year, executives said.Walmart also will cut its capital spending next year to $11.6 billion to $12.9 billion, down as much as $1.4 billion from an earlier forecast, and shift its focus toward e-commerce and smaller stores \u2014 both better fits, executives said, for today\u2019s time-squeezed shopper.\u201cWe\u2019re being thoughtful about growth,\u201d Greg Foran, chief executive of Walmart United States, said. \u201cMy message is quality, not quantity. We can\u2019t turn this ship around overnight, but this is our focus.\u201dWith a slowdown in store growth, Walmart is moving away from the breakneck expansion that has long defined the Walmart Way.Because Walmart trades on such thin margins, new store openings, together with increasing sales at existing stores, have always been a big driver of its growth. Executives have long played up the retailer\u2019s ability to open superstores as evidence of the company\u2019s dominance and its unfettered growth potential.But Walmart has found financing that model increasingly unsustainable. Growth in sales in the United States, excluding new stores, has stalled for six consecutive quarters, hurt by slowing customer traffic and intense competition from both online retailers and smaller discounters like dollar stores.And while Walmart\u2019s superstores changed the way Americans shop, executives repeatedly acknowledged on Wednesday that shoppers continue to evolve, sending Walmart scrambling to adapt.The company is shifting its focus toward smaller Neighborhood Market grocery stores, and it said it would open 180 to 200 of them next year. It is also accelerating its online offerings, and it expects global e-commerce sales to grow around 25 percent next year.\u201cCustomers move very quickly, and we have to keep up with that customer,\u201d said David Cheesewright, who leads Walmart\u2019s international division.Craig R.

Now she sits next to him in the Fed\u2019s ornate Washington boardroom.\u201cIt\u2019s very little in terms of distance but it feels like a big difference to be sitting at the table,\u201d she told me last week at her office in Cleveland.Also weird and new: being addressed as \u201cPresident Mester.\u201dShe will play an outsize role in shaping monetary policy. The head of the Cleveland Fed holds a vote on the Federal Open Market Committee every other year, in a rotation with the Chicago Fed.

{"Headline": "A Retreat From Weather Disasters", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic Scene\u201cI\u2019m worried because insurers only stay in markets until they deem them not profitable,\u201d said Mike Kreidler, the Washington State insurance commissioner. \u201cWe want these insurers to stay fully in the market.\u201dThis is not exclusively an American phenomenon. As the damages wrought by increasingly disruptive weather patterns have climbed around the world, the insurance industry seems to have quietly engaged in what looks a lot like a retreat.Last year, less than a third of the $116 billion in worldwide losses from weather-related disasters were covered by insurance, according to data from the reinsurer Swiss Re. In 2005, the year Katrina struck, insurance picked up 45 percent of the bill.This gradual, low-key withdrawal reveals an alarming weakness. Even as the risks of climactic upheaval increase with a warming atmosphere, the industry created to provide for civilization\u2019s first line of defense against disasters is turning tail.\u201cIn the long run,\u201d the Ceres report added, \u201cthese coverage retreats transfer growing risks to public institutions and local populations, and reduce the resiliency of communities, which are less able to finance postdisaster recoveries.\u201dUsing insurers\u2019 responses last year to a climate risk survey developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Ceres ranked their performance on half a dozen indicators, from how climate change figured in risk-management systems and governance to whether they took into account climate-related risks to their investment portfolios.The good news is that a few big firms are truly paying attention. The bad news is that there are only nine \u2014 including just two American companies, Prudential and the Hartford, and several big reinsurers like Swiss Re and Munich Re.By contrast, 276 insurers earned \u201cbeginning\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d ratings. \u201cEighty-five percent of the industry is just starting to develop a plan or really not doing much at all,\u201d said Cynthia McHale, director of the Ceres insurance program, who led the research effort.For some insurers, apparently, the risks of climate change still seem too distant and abstract. Life insurers must hold very long-term investments in assets like real estate that could lose value sharply because of climate change. Still, Ceres noted, most of them \u201cdo not believe they face significant risks.\u201d Similarly, with the exception of Kaiser Permanente, health insurers are ignoring the impact that climate change could have on disease patterns and human health.What is holding back the insurers on the front line of climate change, it seems, is an entirely different reason: the threat of legal liability.Lawsuits over climate are popping up. In 2011, the power company AES tried to draw on its contracts with Steadfast Insurance when an Inupiat Eskimo village in Alaska sued it, along with a bunch of coal-burning utilities, a coal producer and some energy companies, because sea ice that formerly protected the village from winter storms was melting.\u201cLawsuits are an inevitable part of the American system for determining whether and how to compensate for damages,\u201d the Ceres report noted. \u201cThe larger the alleged injuries from climate change, the greater the recovery efforts will be.\u201dFears of liability risks seem to be freezing insurers like deer in the headlights. Insurance companies that were already wary of the political risk of wading into the climate change debate have been further chilled by the potential legal liability.If they start writing policies specifically excluding liabilities related to climate change, could that be interpreted as saying that previous policies did cover them? What if they don\u2019t mention it at all?\u201cDiscussions of liability disclosure occur more openly outside of the U.S.,\u201d said Lindene E. Patton, the former chief climate product officer at Zurich Re, who was a co-author of the American Bar Association\u2019s \u201cClimate Change and Insurance\u201d report two years ago. \u201cIn the U. S. anything you say can be interpreted in future litigation.\u201dIndeed, \u201cthere\u2019s a huge reluctance to even use the word climate change,\u201d Ms. McHale, the Ceres expert, said. \u201cInsurance companies did not underwrite or price for climate liability. So their lawyers advise them not to talk about it and not to use the word.\u201dThe quandary for insurance companies, of course, is that they can\u2019t give up writing insurance policies without eventually putting themselves out of business. And walking away from markets as they become too risky to insure is not sustainable. For one thing, as insurers on Long Island discovered after Hurricane Sandy, politicians will try to stop them.Insurers won\u2019t be able to stay in markets where they can\u2019t align premiums with rising risk. Government regulators must acknowledge this fact. Policy makers must also realize that the enormous subsidies for Americans to build in harm\u2019s way are ultimately counterproductive.Insurers could play a constructive role in preparing the world for climate change, prodding governments and consumers to take account of rising climate risks. \u201cIf we have the ability to affect the rebuild after a catastrophe we can have an impact,\u201d said Tony Kuczinski, chief executive of Munich Re America.The biggest risk of all is that the insurance industry fails when it is most needed.\u201cAt some point, sooner or later, there will be a situation where there are much higher liabilities than anybody anticipated,\u201d Ms. McHale warned. \u201cSome companies will have problems.\u201dSo will the rest of us.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Central Bank Details Somber State of Europe\u2019s Banking System", "Date": "2014-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe subdued financial performance of the euro-area banking sector observed since the onset of the financial crisis continued in 2013,\u201d the central bank said in its 61-page report.The document also contained some positive news. By several measures, banks in the eurozone are, as a group, less exposed to risk than they were a year earlier, the report said.There are fewer banks \u2014 5,948 in 2013, compared with 6,100 in 2012 and 6,690 in 2008 \u2014 as institutions closed or were acquired. Europe is regarded as having too many banks for the size of its economy, so a decline in the total number should make it easier for the remaining lenders to be profitable.The total value of outstanding loans and other bank assets also declined at the end of 2013, the E.C.B. said, to 26.8 trillion euros, or $33.8 trillion, from \u20ac29.6 trillion in 2012 and \u20ac33.5 trillion in 2008. Much of the decline came from large banks, particularly in Germany and France, that cut back their holdings of derivatives, considered a particularly risky asset.In another sign of reduced risk, banks said more of their funding came from customer deposits, and banks reduced their dependence on funds from money markets.Likewise, banks increased the proportion of their own money, as opposed to borrowed funds, that they used to conduct business. The proportion of capital to assets rose to 13 percent from 12.4 percent in 2012, adjusted for risk, the central bank said. Banks achieved the increase by reducing their total assets or, in some cases, by selling new shares to raise fresh capital.Despite signs of progress in the eurozone banking industry, the E.C.B. report made it clear that lenders still faced severe problems, especially in crisis countries like Greece and Italy.The number of problem loans continued on a steady rise that began in 2008, the report said. Despite signs of stabilization in some countries, \u201cthe turning point does not yet appear to have been reached,\u201d it said.Eurozone banks are also not very profitable, the central bank said. Banks in Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Slovenia lost money on average, and in many other countries profit margins were slender.The E.C.B. acknowledged that its monetary policy was partly to blame. With official interest rates close to zero, banks earn lower margins on the loans they issue.But problem loans also hurt bank profit, the E.C.B. said, as did the cost of past wrongdoing. While the report did not mention individual banks, institutions such as Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt have paid billions in fines, settlements and legal fees related to their conduct in the years leading up to, and sometimes after, the financial crisis.In June, the French bank BNP Paribas agreed to pay an $8.9 billion penalty and plead guilty to charges that it transferred billions of dollars on behalf of Sudan and other countries blacklisted by the United States.On the bright side, the E.C.B. said, the banking sectors in Spain and Latvia regained profitability.Advertisement"}

Suddenly, that free-floating malaise and lack of inspiration everyone keeps complaining about has a name.Consider, for example, fashion (admittedly, I am a fashion person so I would consider it, but stick with me). The reason for that feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu I had as I sat through fashion show after fashion show during the last ready-to-wear season and saw yet more \u201creinventions\u201d and \u201chomages\u201d to 1960s rock chick dresses and 1970s flared trousers, 1980s power jackets and 1920s flapper frocks, and wondered, \u201cHow do I explain this lack of new ideas among so many extremely talented designers?\u201d The new mediocre. The inexplicable fact that Normcore, which effectively means dressing in bland and generic clothes, has somehow managed to be elevated to the status of phenomenon rather than joke or just-stuff-that\u2019s-in-your-closet (which, let\u2019s be honest, it is)? The new mediocre.The answer to the endless debate we in the industry have over why big fashion groups would rather buy an old brand name than back a fresh one? The new mediocre.Given that the underlying principle of fashion is to identify that ephemeral state of culture and society known as the zeitgeist and reflect it back at the world in sartorial form, this would suggest that what has been happening in fashion, and the explanation for it, actually reflects a broader reality. And indeed, once you start thinking along new mediocre lines, you see it everywhere.Reading about the Republican economic agenda, for example, which Prof. Matthew J. Slaughter of Dartmouth labeled \u201ca compendium of modest expectations,\u201d I thought, \u201cOh, there\u2019s the new mediocre at work.\u201d When my husband complained about President Obama\u2019s compromised agenda, I shrugged and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just the new mediocre.\u201dTalking to a banker friend who was bemoaning the trend toward investors\u2019 losing faith in the idea of genius hedge funds that can outperform the market and moving their money into index funds, hence \u201csettling for average returns,\u201d I nodded knowingly and said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s the new mediocre.\u201d The fall in Twitter\u2019s stock price as investors began to worry about \u201clackluster\u201d revenue and user growth? Blame the new mediocre! The fact that Rob Ford, Toronto\u2019s disgraced ex-mayor, still managed to win a City Council seat? The new mediocre (it exists in Canada, too).That feeling of browsing your Kindle, or standing in your local Barnes & Noble, faced with yet more young adult trilogies about dystopias and tough-girl heroines, or soft-porn-for-grown-ups trilogies (or just trilogies, period), and thinking, \u201cWhat is there to read?\u201d The new mediocre.That harrumph when you peruse the movie listings and find yourself choosing between comic-book-hero action films and old-guy action films \u2014 unless you want to go way, way across town to the one surviving and obscure art-house cinema that values conversation over abs? The new mediocre.In fact, the only time I refuse to accept the new mediocre as an explanation of a real-life situation is in the context of my children\u2019s excuse for so-so homework. But then, there is nothing new about parental hypocrisy. Granted, the above is a broad generalization, and there are pockets of brilliance and hope amid the gloom (\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d for example, or the proliferation of small independent presses). But that doesn\u2019t obviate the general trend: Such examples are the exceptions that prove the rule. They stick out because, in the world of the new mediocre, they are so rare.Still, while being able to identify and explain something might be very satisfying (if, in this case, a little depressing), it does not make it any more palatable. Though it does raise the question: How did we get here?Arguably, all of this cultural and political mediocrity is related to Ms. Lagarde\u2019s economic mediocrity; as conventional wisdom goes, when the economy is slow, both businesses \u2014 creative and otherwise \u2014 and individuals tend to play it cautious, opting for incremental change to known quantities or for milquetoast recreations of what succeeded before, as opposed to radical change. We get locked in a vicious cycle of same-old-safe-old. You see it in the endless fetishization of the sneaker, the vampire-meets-girl retreads and the obsessive fixation on yet another maybe-possible Clinton/Bush standoff. That\u2019s a political drama at least we think we know.And it is all exacerbated, certainly in creativity\u2019s commercial case, by the concurrent belief that consumer interest can be piqued simply by a never-ending cascade of new stuff, thus making it even harder for anybody to have enough time to think up actually new new stuff, and forcing them \u2014 designers, authors, producers, what have you \u2014 into having to rejigger old stuff to make it look like new stuff. Got that?The problem is that the more familiar a product is, the less exciting it is, which makes it less likely to do well, which makes it really not a safe bet at all. More than 30 years after the Me Decade, we are in the middle of the Meh Decade (as my grandmother might say).Or so it seems. Given that eras tend not to get their permanent label until a few years after they have officially ended, there may be some time for this to change. And in that context, perhaps there is something to be said for another truism of fashion, which states that what comes in must go out. It\u2019s the style equivalent of Newton\u2019s third law of motion. If accurate, this would dictate that, at some point, the new mediocre will become the old mediocre. Certainly, that is Ms. Lagarde\u2019s hope, though she did not put it that way exactly. What she said instead was that the global economy \u201ccan aim for a better path where bold policies would accelerate growth, increase employment and achieve a \u2018new momentum.\u2019\u00a0\u201dO.K., it\u2019s a little vague and rhetorical, but still: the new momentum? I can work with that.The chief fashion critic and fashion director for The New York Times. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Home as a Piggy Bank? Not Everywhere ", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Section: WealthThe initial good news for home-equity wealth building \u2014 particularly for those who have managed to hold onto their homes \u2014 is that in most of the country prices have generally recovered since the 2008 financial crisis. But building home equity will largely depend on where you live, when you bought your home and if you tap that equity for retirement income. The wide regional differences in home appreciation are worth noting for those still trying to use real estate to increase their nest egg.Homeowners who have been in their homes the longest will probably see the greatest increase in home equity. According to the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, a trade association, homeowners 62 years and older \u201cnow have more equity in their homes than at any time since early 2008. Home equity held by persons 62 and older has grown by more than 22 percent since the second quarter 2012, to a total of $3.73 trillion.\u201d This means that if you\u2019re an older, longtime homeowner outside the Sun Belt, you\u2019ve probably regained the equity you lost during the housing bust of 2007-9. You may be able to tap that equity for retirement or other purposes through a loan, refinancing or downsizing. Yet is home equity a reliable piggy bank? Home equity creation used to be seen as a forced savings plan. Whatever you invested in mortgage principal appreciated roughly at the rate of inflation. The housing credit crisis changed that perception for several generations of Americans. The bust devastated home prices in some of the most desirable Sun Belt areas \u2014 Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada.Declines ranged from as severe as 69 percent in the Daytona Beach, Fla., area to less than 5 percent in the largest Texas cities, according to Homes.com.The tide may have turned, though. Demographic changes in society \u2014 especially baby boomers downsizing or moving to warmer places \u2014 mean some coastal areas may once again prove to be good locations for building home equity, especially if building is restricted or climate change policies make development more expensive.Some of the most robust growth projections for housing appreciation are for the coasts. According to the Local Market Monitor, which tracks housing prices in more than 300 markets in the United States, California had the best performance over the last 20 years and is projected to grow a cumulative 30 percent over the next three years. Despite high taxes and the state\u2019s well-publicized budget and water woes, demand is still strong for the Bay Area and parts of Southern California. Technology start-ups and mature businesses want to be around Silicon Valley and Stanford University. And the Los Angeles area is a cultural and business mecca.Elsewhere, the Local Market Monitor forecasts that prices are expected to rise 20 percent over the next three years in Florida, which in some areas suffered the most severe declines in the crash. Another standout is Texas, which is attracting new residents from the Midwest and Northeast and is forecast to grow by 20 to 30 percent in most areas.Besides California, Florida and Texas, the Local Market Monitor anticipates robust gains in Colorado and the Pacific Northwest, said Ingo Winzer, president of the service.The key to home equity growth is a combination of strong local economies, building and jobs. People have to find an area desirable and want to move there from other places \u2014 the kind of mobility that virtually came to a standstill during the recession years. And as land for development becomes scarcer and demand grows for new retirement housing, home prices will benefit. \u201cThose markets with the best expected home price appreciation have strong economies that attract in-migration,\u201d said Mr. Winzer. \u201cIt\u2019s population growth from migration that has the strongest effect on home prices, especially now. On the other hand, people are moving out of the Midwest, moving to Texas or the West and Northwest, and are leaving behind an excess of housing with depressed prices.\u201dOther regions will not be as fortunate as retirees move to warmer locations with lower living costs. The Local Market Monitor projects mediocre to flat returns for Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and upstate New York. In the past, the worst performers in its survey have been in Ohio: Akron, Cleveland, Dayton and Toledo.Because housing prices have proved to be volatile \u2014 and may not return what they did in the past \u2014 you may be better off concentrating on financial assets. As the financial crisis demonstrated, home appreciation is far from guaranteed. Areas can be overbuilt, and speculators can drive up prices with cheap financing. \u201cAre you better off in financial assets than housing assets?\u201d asks Gary Painter,\u00a0director of research at the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California. \u201cHomes shouldn\u2019t be thought of as a way to save for retirement.\u201d While reverse mortgages can be complex and expensive \u2014 they leverage equity for current cash needs \u2014 homeowners can also get access to home equity through a \u201ccash out\u201d sale, selling their home and buying or renting a less expensive dwelling. Michelle Brennan Hall, president of Brennan Wealth Advisors in Addison, Tex., said, \u201cFor the most part, building home equity is a smart financial step for the overall net worth picture of individuals, yet it should not be a primary driver as a source for retirement income.\u201dFor most retirees, being debt-free can be a better financial strategy than using home equity for income or expenses. Having a mortgage in retirement reduces your monthly income, which is a growing problem. Nearly a third of those 65 and older had a mortgage in 2011. That\u2019s up from 22 percent in 2001, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cBuilding equity in a home is another way of approaching a debt-free status for retirement, which should be the primary goal when it comes to homeownership,\u201d Ms. Brennan Hall said.

{"Headline": "The Empty-Nest Book Hatchery ", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultural StudiesWhen her book \u201cThe Dog Stays in the Picture\u201d came out in September, Susan Morse joined the swelling ranks of writers chronicling the departure of their adult children and contemplating their own future as empty nesters.Ms. Morse\u2019s tale centers on a rescue greyhound she adopted to fill the looming gap in her life \u2014 only to discover that the retired racer was even needier than her husband and three children. Yet the dog, recounted Kirkus Reviews, \u201cserved as the anchor that unknowingly helped keep her on an even keel as she navigated and transitioned through the emotionally rocky waters of becoming an empty nester.\u201dThe generation that religiously read \u201cWhat to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting\u201d to herald the arrival of children is now fueling a flurry of publications and blogs aimed at softening their departure.Amazon lists dozens of titles, ranging from \u201cThe Empty Nest: A Mother\u2019s Hidden Grief\u201d to \u201cMy Nest Isn\u2019t Empty, It Just Has More Closet Space.\u201d Katie Couric recently hosted a television segment devoted to the transition. And when Rob Lowe appeared on the David Letterman show last spring to promote his new memoir, his lament on becoming an empty nester (\u201cI cried like a little girl\u201d) went viral on YouTube.Ms. Aronsson sees a direct correlation between parents\u2019 level of involvement in their children\u2019s\u2019 lives and their sense of disequilibrium when they leave. \u201cWhen things shift, people can lose their sense of identity or get stuck in a rut,\u201d she said.According to the Mayo Clinic, empty-nest syndrome isn\u2019t a clinical diagnosis, but a phenomenon: \u201cIn the past,\u201d the website notes, \u201cresearch suggested that parents dealing with empty-nest syndrome experienced a profound sense of loss that might make them vulnerable to depression, alcoholism, identity crisis and marital conflicts. However, recent studies suggest that an empty nest can also provide parents with many benefits. When the last child leaves home, parents have an opportunity to reconnect with each other, improve the quality of their marriage and rekindle interests for which they previously might not have had time.\u201dJust as almost every parenting trend has triggered a backlash (think tiger moms vs. three-martini moms), there are opposing empty-nest lifestyles. On one side are the mourners, who attend support groups, send care packages and seek ways to stay connected to their adult children. On the other are the rejoicers, who take adventurous trips and try to make up for the \u201clost years\u201d of car-pooling to soccer practice and supervising math homework.Instead, she encourages parents to revel in their new role, watching movies until 4 a.m., eating cereal for dinner and inviting friends over midweek. \u201cYou need to embrace your empty nest and not wallow in your misery,\u201d Ms. Mellor said. \u201cThe next time an empty-nest expert suggests that you might be feeling lonely, sad and abandoned, run as fast as you can in the other direction,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bad parent because you\u2019re excited about finally having your freedom.\u201dMs. Mellor\u2019s book offers ways for empty nesters to fill the hours once devoted to child-rearing activities: take a cooking class, train for a marathon, try trapeze lessons. Forget about sitting forlornly in your child\u2019s bedroom, gazing at fading kindergarten photos and dusty Little League trophies. \u201cTransform it into a crafts room, art studio or sewing room,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can keep the bed in there as a place to lie down and daydream while you\u2019re waiting for paint or glue to dry.\u201dSome empty nesters are turning to blogs for camaraderie as well as advice. Mary Dell Harrington and Lisa Endlich Heffernan started \u201cGrown & Flown: Parenting Never Ends\u201d three years ago. Their most popular posts, such as \u201cKids Going to College: Getting Your Heart and Head Ready,\u201d regularly receive more than 100,000 views. \u201cWhen kids leave home, you lose the community of parents that shared your interests,\u201d Ms. Heffernan said. \u201cThrough social media, you can find a new community.\u201dOne recent post, \u201cNine Reasons I Regret Being a Stay-at-Home Mom,\u201d appeared in The Huffington Post and prompted a \u201cToday\u201d show interview. \u201cOne reason people like our blog is that we don\u2019t shy away from the hard truths,\u201d Ms. Heffernan said. \u201cWe try to look at the conventional wisdom differently.\u201dMs. Aronsson said blogs can be valuable but cautions against using them as a crutch. \u201cFor people who need information or support, blogging can be helpful, but it can also be a diversion. Like any tool or strategy for coping with change, you don\u2019t want it to take on a life of its own.\u201dNot surprisingly, there is a growing crop of books for parents coping with this trend as well. Everett Jones, a spokesman for Publishers Weekly, cites titles including \u201cAccordion Family: Boomerang Kids, Anxious Parents, and the Private Toll of Global Competition,\u201d \u201cUnder One Roof Again: All Grown Up and (Re)Learning to Live Together Happily\u201d and \u201cThe Hands-On Guide to Surviving Adult Children at Home.\u201d\u201cWith the economy not doing well,\u201d Mr. Jones said, \u201cthis seems to be a growth area.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Is Silent on Doomsday Book, a Blueprint for Fighting Crises", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s called the Doomsday Book \u2014 though by now, officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York probably regret they ever came up with that catchy nickname.It\u2019s a collection of legal opinions that describe and delineate the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to fight financial crises, along with a variety of related documents.And the Fed would really prefer to tell the public nothing more than that.The Doomsday Book has popped into public view because a group of investors suing the government over the terms of its bailout of the American International Group say some of the memos inside show the Fed broke its own rules.Last week, in a courtroom overlooking the White House, government lawyers took a break from defending the government against the $40 billion lawsuit, and instead pressed a judge to keep the contents under seal and to limit references to its contents by lawyers and witnesses participating in the weekslong trial.\u201cOf the tens of thousands of documents that we have produced in this case, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has sought to retain confidentiality because of the internal sensitivity of only this one,\u201d a lawyer for the New York Fed, John S. Kiernan of Debevoise & Plimpton, told the United States Court of Federal Claims.Even the plaintiffs have managed only photocopies of the indexes from the 2006, 2012 and 2014 versions \u2014 each a stack of papers more than an inch high.Nevertheless, a portrait of the book has emerged from the back-and-forth, as detailed in transcripts of the trial that were first highlighted by The Wall Street Journal.The Doomsday Book, as it happens, is not a book. It is a collection of documents maintained by the New York Fed\u2019s legal department.The contents include \u201can extensive legal history of Federal Reserve lending activities,\u201d and memos on subjects that deal with the Fed\u2019s authority to make loans to municipalities and restructure debts. There is no comparable collection in Washington. The New York Fed is the central bank\u2019s firefighting department.The New York Fed keeps three full sets, plus an electronic version, and it circulates an index. These facts are on the first page of the index, which the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, David Boies, read aloud in the courtroom last week.Timothy F. Geithner, who led the New York Fed during the early stages of the financial crisis before becoming Treasury secretary, testified that he kept in his office an abridged version, in a binder about two inches thick, containing the index and a selection of memos. He said he had never seen the full work.Mr. Geithner in his testimony also played down the importance of the Doomsday Book, saying that he had consulted it infrequently during the crisis because the Fed was quickly forced to take measures beyond anything it had done before.\u201cWe were operating really outside the boundaries of established precedent,\u201d he said.At times, the Fed may have even decided to throw out the book. The 2006 version contained \u201can informal opinion by the board\u2019s general counsel that Federal Reserve Banks do not have the power to make non-recourse loans.\u201d Such loans do not allow the Fed to recoup losses beyond the value of the collateral.Mr. Geithner acknowledged in his testimony that during the recent crisis, notwithstanding, the Fed made non-recourse loans.But Mr. Geithner, in a memoir published this year, wrote that the Doomsday Book did help the New York Fed deal with the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns. The Fed kept the company on life support for a few crucial days by lending money to JPMorgan Chase, which in turn lent money to Bear Stearns.Mr. Geithner wrote that the idea came from \u201cTom Baxter, our general counsel, taking a page from the Doomsday Book, the binder full of information about the New York Fed\u2019s emergency powers that he had helped write years earlier.\u201dThe lawsuit argues that the Fed ignored the legal opinions in the Doomsday Book again in taking a 79.9 percent equity stake in A.I.G. in the fall of 2008. It argues that the Fed lacked the authority to take an equity stake in the company.Mr. Geithner and other officials have testified that the bailout was meant to keep the financial crisis from deepening, and they have defended its legality.The New York Fed has offered a limited explanation of its desire for secrecy.Mr. Kiernan told the judge at a hearing last week that the collection is \u201cconfidential, proprietary and important.\u201d The Fed\u2019s lawyers also have argued the book deserves privacy because it contains the confidential advice of the Fed\u2019s lawyers.More broadly, the Fed has long regarded secrecy as a strategic advantage. Highlighting the full extent of its power to rescue financial companies might, for example, encourage companies to behave more recklessly. It might reduce the Fed\u2019s bargaining power during a crisis. And it might ignite prematurely the kind of political outrage at the measures at the Fed\u2019s disposal that frequently attend actual bailouts.The newest version is particularly sensitive. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act limited the Fed\u2019s ability to make emergency loans to troubled financial companies like A.I.G. A bipartisan group of senators is pressing the Fed to accept a relatively strict interpretation of those limitations.The Fed\u2019s conclusions will no doubt be reflected in future versions of the Doomsday Book, if they are not already.A headline on Wednesday about the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s so-called Doomsday Book and how it has come into public view in a trial involving the 2008 rescue of the American International Group referred incorrectly to the document\u2019s connection to the A.I.G. bailout. While the Doomsday Book is a collection of memos and legal opinions that can serve as a blueprint for fighting financial crises, Fed officials have said that it did not guide their actions on A.I.G.Advertisement"}

If there is one guiding principle at work, it is the notion that the city, which has thumbed its nose at the water for 300 years, can no longer keep the sea at bay, but must by necessity invite it in.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just build barriers; we wanted to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Henk Ovink, a Dutch water-management expert who now serves as a senior adviser to the Presidential Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, a group within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has earmarked billions for the program. \u201cFor that to happen, we have to live with the water, to understand it, while still understanding our vulnerabilities.\u201dIt is, if nothing else, enormous, comprising the construction of sea walls and bulkheads, beach replenishment, the creation of parks as buffer zones, the retrofitting of apartment buildings, commercial structures and single-family homes, and the redesign of power stations, subway tunnels, sewage treatment plants, hospitals, utility poles and even ordinary streets.New York has been here before. In the 1960s, after Hurricanes Carol and Donna, the Army Corps of Engineers proposed building barriers at Throgs Neck in the Bronx and at the Narrows. In later years, there were plans for a giant swinging gate at the mouth of Jamaica Bay and a 15-foot, steel-and-concrete wall to run the length of Coney Island. None of these projects was ever undertaken, because of environmental concerns and a lack of financing. But this time, some of the money has already been set aside, suggesting that things might finally be different.The Big U\u201cThe idea was to create a public amenity that also had a protective element,\u201d Mr. Bergmann said. \u201cWe could have built walls, but walls are only used .01 percent of the time, during crises. We wanted something that was aesthetically pleasing, well designed and was useful all the time.\u201dIn Battery Park, for instance, the plan calls for a series of \u201cupland knolls\u201d where people could sunbathe, garden or even farm most of the time. During a storm, the built-up landscape would fend off the sea.Could it actually be built? The Big U\u2019s first so-called compartment, running along the East River from 23rd Street to Montgomery Street on the Lower East Side, is expected to break ground in 2017 and be finished three years later. The federal government has given the city $335 million to implement the first section of the BIG U that will serve as a test case for the still-unfunded portions of the project on the West Side and in Lower Manhattan.90,000 Buildings at RiskFrom seaside bungalows in Staten Island to Wall Street offices with harbor views, nearly 70,000 buildings in New York sit within the 100-year floodplain, meaning that in any given year they have a 1 percent chance of being swamped. According to the city, that total could increase in the next 10 years, because of rising seas, to almost 90,000 buildings, an area encompassing 660 million square feet (almost 24 square miles) and housing more than 440,000 people.In September, Mayor de Blasio announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had given the city $108 million to install backup generators, elevated boilers and new flood-barrier systems at the Coney Island Houses, a five-building public housing project that was inundated during the storm, leaving its 1,400 residents without heat or power for 22 days. The work in Coney Island is meant to serve as the model for a continuing collaboration between FEMA and the New York City Housing Authority to reinforce 15 other public housing projects damaged by the storm.Plugging the HolesAfter Hurricane Sandy dumped untold tons of water into the Montague Tunnel, a subway tube connecting Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, engineers at New York City Transit faced a daunting problem: how to redesign a subterranean system in a coastal city and keep the water out.The answer, said John O\u2019Grady, vice president for infrastructure and facilities at the transportation agency, was to plug the system\u2019s holes: vent bays, manholes, station entrances, access hatches and emergency exits. At South Ferry alone, Mr. O\u2019Grady said, the agency was forced to design \u2014 and will eventually install \u2014 coverings for more than 500 openings: from simple sliding panels to custom-made collapsible metal traps.\u201cWe had to make some changes,\u201d said Matt Sniffen, the utility\u2019s chief engineer for electrical distribution. Among those changes are plans to build higher walls and flood-proof concrete barriers at its 14th Street-East River substation, which exploded during Sandy; to install submersible equipment in areas prone to floods; to build new utility poles able to withstand winds of up to 110 miles per hour; and to bury more than 30 miles of overhead power lines in the five boroughs and in Westchester County by 2016.Teaching ResiliencySo far, 15 communities have been chosen to receive more than $200 million in federal money through New York Rising, in grants of between $3 million and $25 million each. In the adjoining Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brighton Beach, Coney Island, Manhattan Beach and Sea Gate, for example, community leaders have proposed the creation of a vocational high school that would teach students resiliency, sustainability and emergency preparedness skills. In Howard Beach, Queens, near Kennedy Airport, leaders have recommended creating a public education program to help homeowners and business people get technical training and counseling on how to make their property more resilient.The Next DisasterHave all these projects truly made New Yorkers safer? Will the city be better able now to withstand a big storm than it was two years ago? The consensus among architects, engineers, academics and urban planners is a qualified yes.Instead of separate, interlocking efforts by city, state and federal officials, Dr. Rodin recommended a single plan that would take advantage of the untapped powers of the city\u2019s business community and capital markets. In San Francisco, she said, municipal officials have developed a broad-based plan against mudslides, drought and earthquakes, involving traditional corporations like Comcast and Pacific Gas and Electric, as well as those from the local sharing economy like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb.\u201cWe haven\u2019t sufficiently engaged the private sector yet, which is a huge piece of the puzzle,\u201d Dr. Rodin said. \u201cAs for the markets, there\u2019s a lot of money sitting on the sidelines that could be brought into building resilient infrastructure.\u201dTo other experts, the key to making the city more resilient is not more money, but the understanding that disasters like Hurricane Sandy are not caused by nature alone, but by human beings, too.\u201cThe driving force behind New York has always been limitless growth,\u201d Professor Steinberg said. \u201cBut the unpleasant truth is that for all its wealth and development, New York is still vulnerable.\u201d\u201cWe need to retreat, especially intellectually,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom the idea that we can keep on building anywhere we want. New Yorkers are tough. They can take whatever nature throws their way. But you just can\u2019t grow forever at the expense of the sea.\u201dAn article last Sunday about New York\u2019s plans for coastal defenses because of Hurricane Sandy described incorrectly the funding for six proposals chosen through Rebuild by Design, an international contest soliciting ways to protect the city. The money for the proposals, including one called the Big U, came from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and was given to government officials. It did not come from Rebuild by Design, and it was not given to the teams behind the winning plans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Of Virtue and Vice, and a Vatican Priest", "Date": "2014-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a clear, warm day, a motorcycle zoomed through a quiet, narrow passageway in the old section of Salerno on Italy\u2019s southwestern coast. The rider slowed in front of an elegant house with a baroque stone gate just long enough to shout \u201cThief! Thief!\u201d before racing off.The object of derision, Msgr. Nunzio Scarano, was behind the thick walls of his house and did not hear the rider. But the insult would not have surprised him. He has heard quite a few. He\u2019s been called a \u201cconsummate delinquent\u201d and a \u201cpleasure-loving prelate.\u201d Even Pope Francis cracked a joke about him, saying that \u201cfor sure he did not enter prison because he acted like Blessed Imelda,\u201d before calling events in which the monsignor was involved \u201ca scandal that hurts me.\u201d Before his arrest in June 2013, the monsignor was a top accountant at the Vatican office that, at that time, managed the Holy See\u2019s real estate and investments. He is currently on trial, accused of money laundering \u2014 most notably, of trying to smuggle $26 million from Switzerland to Italy in a private plane, with the help of an Italian secret service agent. An Italian judge calculated Monsignor Scarano\u2019s wealth at more than $8.2 million, though the Vatican paid the priest just $41,000 a year. Italian authorities seized the 17-room, $1.7 million house in Salerno, where he is now under house arrest, along with many bank accounts; two of them, at the Vatican Bank, were seized by Vatican authorities.The monsignor\u2019s arrest made front-page news in Italy. \u201cScandal at the Vatican Bank,\u201d screamed La Repubblica, a Rome-based newspaper. Within a few days, the Vatican Bank\u2019s second and third in command resigned in disgrace. More than a dozen bankers, regulators, prosecutors, lawyers and Vatican insiders were interviewed for this article, and a majority of them consider Monsignor Scarano a small fish in the pond of the Vatican financial system, the accusations against him a mere symptom of much larger problems that Pope Francis is now energetically trying to correct.A number of official Italian inquiries into money-laundering operations by organized crime or by corrupt politicians and businessmen have led to the doors of the Vatican Bank. The bank itself is not huge: It has just $7.9 billion in assets and 17,419 customers. Only the Holy See and religious entities, charities, members of the clergy and employees are supposed to hold accounts there. What made it appealing to those who prefer to operate in the shadows were its location \u2014 there are no border controls between the Vatican and Italy, allowing cash to flow virtually unchecked \u2014 and an opaque money transfer system. That system has undergone a major overhaul. Pressure came from Italy\u2019s central bank when it required Italian banks doing business with the Vatican Bank to ask for transaction details, including the names of people moving money. And there was internal pressure to reform, started under Pope Benedict XVI, in 2009. Expanding on efforts started by his predecessor, Pope Francis announced in the last few months a series of reforms to make the Vatican financial system more transparent and accountable.In what Italian prosecutors welcomed as an unusual move, the Vatican also cooperated with the Italian judiciary on the Scarano case, turning over documents about the monsignor\u2019s financial activities. The Holy See, it seemed, was determined to step out into the light.The charges against the cleric convey the unpleasant suggestion that priestly vestments provided cover for disreputable transactions. The monsignor sees it differently, and agreed to speak last December to tell his version of the story that had brought him so low. \u201cI spent my whole life doing good deeds,\u201d said the monsignor, who is 62, as he sat upright on a white couch in his living room. \u201cSometimes I took advantage of the rich to help the poor \u2014 I behaved somewhat like Robin Hood.\u201d Tall and slender, he was dressed in a light blue pullover sweater, simple trousers and black shoes, his gray hair neatly combed. His vast apartment was furnished with white and gold baroque furniture and filled with decorative china and hundreds of books. \u201cSometimes I told some lies, too,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut what mattered to me was to help someone.\u201dProsecutors say he was, indeed, trying to help someone. But while the monsignor seemed to be suggesting that he has helped only the poor, prosecutors say he used his position to try to help his rich friends \u2014 and earn the fruits of their generosity. His trial in Salerno began on Sept. 29 and is expected to continue for several months. In early January, he was barred from talking to the news media, and I have not been able to speak with him directly since December. \u201cI\u2019ll never tell anyone the names of the people whom I helped,\u201d the monsignor told me then. \u201cAs Jesus said: When you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right is doing, so that your almsgiving may be secret. And your Father who sees in secret will repay you.\u201d\u2018The Calling by God\u2019Born in Salerno, the monsignor had an eventful youth. \u201cAs a teenager, I was a leftist, a rabid anticlerical,\u201d he said with a smirk. What brought him back to the mother church was something he called \u201ca miracle.\u201d The monsignor tells the story this way: At 17, he learned that he had a rare circulatory system disorder called Buerger\u2019s disease. Doctors warned, he said, \u201cthat I would have lived on just for six more months.\u201d The surgery he needed was very expensive, and he did not want to bankrupt his family. He considered suicide. According to Monsignor Scarano\u2019s recounting, he climbed to the balcony of his parents\u2019 house, ready to leap to his death. His parents restrained him and persuaded him to go to Naples for surgery. \u201cWhile entering the operating theater, my Aunt Titina put an image of the Virgin Mary under my pillow,\u201d the monsignor recalled. \u201cI felt the Virgin\u2019s mantle covering me. I saw her upon me.\u201dSix months later, the young Scarano was declared out of peril. He told me that he dropped to his knees to confess after having shunned that sacrament for years.But the conversion did not immediately lead him out of temptation. He liked nice things and traveling. He dressed well, cultivating the image of a carefree bon vivant, and had \u201ca number of romantic relationships,\u201d he told me. \u201cLet\u2019s say that I lived it up.\u201d Rita Occidente Lupo, a journalist based in Salerno who has known him since he was a young man, confirmed that he liked to have a good time. \u201cHe was the most handsome guy in Salerno,\u201d she added.At 30, Nunzio Scarano was ready to settle down. Skillful with money, he had become an executive in a commercial bank and was engaged to be married. During a five-day spiritual retreat in a Benedictine abbey, however, he had what he refers to as \u201cthe calling by God.\u201d At the end of the retreat, he decided to give up all his worldly possessions to become a priest. As he tells it, he moved to Rome to study theology. His family opposed his decision. Returning to Salerno for Christmas in 1982, just a few months into the seminary program, his mother refused to let him in the house. \u201cShe told me there was no room for me,\u201d he said, using the same phrase as the innkeepers who turned away Mary and Joseph. And he recalled suffering. He said he slept at the train station, eating a piece of bread that a passenger had tossed away and sneaking onto the train back to Rome. \u201cI spent the whole trip in the toilet to escape the ticket inspector,\u201d he said, \u201cfor I had no money to pay for the trip.\u201d Some friends stepped in to help him \u2014 particularly, Monsignor Scarano said, \u201cmembers of the D\u2019Amico family.\u201d Antonio D\u2019Amico was the co-founder of a shipping company and had known him since he was a child. The priest in training thus was able to meet many of Mr. D\u2019Amico\u2019s wealthy friends: bankers, entrepreneurs and members of the nobility. After his ordination in 1987, he was sent to tend to the parish of St. Cecilia in Eboli, a town southeast of Salerno. In the five years he spent there, Monsignor Scarano improved the local church\u2019s relationship with parishioners and secured donations to upgrade parish facilities, according to both him and the Rev. Daniele Peron, who served with him and is still pastor of the parish. \u201cPeople were constantly offering Scarano a lot of money,\u201d Father Peron said. \u201cDon Nunzio knew how to deal with people.\u201d Father Peron remembered Monsignor Scarano helping convert a local bully, who was subsequently killed by the local Mafia. The monsignor said he became a target of the mobsters and was shot at three times. He said his archbishop asked him to leave Eboli and to go to the Vatican for his own safety. \u201cI tried to protest the decision,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut then I yielded to serve the church.\u201d More Than BroccoliDuring his years as a chief accountant at the Vatican, Monsignor Scarano cultivated his relationships with wealthy benefactors. He became a close friend of counts, marquises and businesspeople, too. He said he christened newborns of the Roman elite, officiated at high-society weddings, hobnobbed at important receptions and accepted these people\u2019s generous gifts for charity. \u201cI worked tirelessly,\u201d he said, \u201cand I did not take advantage of my position \u2014 not even to get a free cup of coffee.\u201dMonsignor Scarano conceded, though, that his status in the Vatican bureaucracy had its advantages. \u201cWhen I was the pastor of the parish in Eboli, my parishioners presented me with fresh broccoli,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut if you officiate at the wedding of a princess, or of a marquis, they easily give you 10,000 to 50,000 euros. You know, the divine providence has always been very generous with me.\u201dMany times, providence bore the name of the D\u2019Amico family. Over nine years, according to court records in Salerno, members of the D\u2019Amico family transferred more than $6.9 million into Monsignor Scarano\u2019s accounts at the Vatican Bank: his personal one and the one he called \u201caccount for the elderly.\u201d All the transfers were labeled donations. One acquaintance of the monsignor was Giovanni Carenzio, a financial broker from Pompeii who was married to a Spanish noblewoman. Mr. Carenzio promised investors mind-boggling returns \u2014 up to 20 percent in three months, according to La Provincia, a Spanish newspaper. Spanish prosecutors said they thought this investment was a Ponzi scheme, and Mr. Carenzio is currently under investigation. A number of wealthy people, including Paolo D\u2019Amico, gave Mr. Carenzio a lot of money. According to a court filing, Mr. D\u2019Amico said he invested millions simply because the monsignor told them that Mr. Carenzio was a \u201ctrustworthy man.\u201dIn May 2012, Mr. Carenzio phoned the monsignor. The broker said Spanish prosecutors were investigating him\u00a0for possible\u00a0fraud. He hinted that prosecutors might find out about a suspicious transaction he said he had made in favor of Cesare and Paolo D\u2019Amico, according to court filings in Rome. \u201cThere are proofs in the bank accounts,\u201d he told Monsignor Scarano in a wiretapped conversation that is now part of court filings.Monsignor Scarano felt that he could not leave his friends \u2014 and generous donors \u2014 in the cold, said his lawyer Silverio Sica. The monsignor asked Mr. Carenzio to avoid mentioning the D\u2019Amicos to Spanish prosecutors, according to a transcript of a phone call filed in Italian courts. He also discussed repatriating to Italy \u2014 in cash and tax-free \u2014 $26 million that, according to the monsignor, the D\u2019Amicos had invested with Mr. Carenzio and that was kept in Switzerland. According to prosecutors and wiretap transcripts, the monsignor\u2019s plan was to give the money back to his friends, tell them he had steered them away from a potentially dangerous situation and accept their generosity for his unsolicited help. According to prosecutors and court filings, Monsignor Scarano, in order to carry out this plan, asked for help from another friend, Giovanni Zito, who was a member of the Italian secret service. Mr. Zito agreed to take the risky assignment of bringing back the D\u2019Amicos\u2019 cash on a private plane, in exchange for a refund of his expenses that a judge in Rome later characterized as \u201crealistically marked up.\u201d On July 16, 2012, Mr. Zito went to Switzerland and waited. But Mr. Carenzio made excuses. The D\u2019Amicos never saw their money again. Still, when the D\u2019Amicos learned that the monsignor had tried to help, they thanked him with a donation, according to wiretapped conversations that are part of court filings. That was in mid-November 2012. By that time, officers of the Guardia di Finanza \u2014 Italy\u2019s law enforcement agency for financial crime \u2014 had been tapping Monsignor Scarano\u2019s conversations and checking all his transfers for months. They had been tipped off by an anonymous source who had written, in part, \u201cHow could this man, in just a few years, buy a whole floor of a prestigious building in Salerno\u2019s city center, worth at least $4 million?\u201dThe Charity DefenseAt 6:30 a.m. on June 28, 2013, officials of the Guardia di Finanza pulled up in front of a rectory where Monsignor Scarano was staying in Palidoro, a town west of Rome, and rang the bell. The monsignor, who had been sleeping, opened the door and was told that he was under arrest. A few hours later, in an elegant gray suit, he entered a cell in the most crowded prison in Rome. After several weeks in jail, the monsignor was released and put under house arrest. Prosecutors in Rome have charged him with corruption while, in Salerno, he has been charged with money laundering. In the interview in December, the monsignor contended that the millions of dollars that had accumulated in his accounts were all for charity. This is also a defense that his lawyer will present.\u201cI was saving it to build a house for terminally ill patients. Why would I have kept it in a bank account otherwise?\u201d he asked, his voice rising in disdain. \u201cI would have spent it. Astronomically expensive trips to the Bahama Islands, a boat in Amalfi \u2014 guess what: I did not do any of these things.\u201d Prosecutors challenge that explanation, and others who knew him say he has a penchant for embellishment. Father Peron, who worked with him in Eboli, said Monsignor Scarano \u201cnever got shot in Eboli \u2014 not even once.\u201d Nor did he need convincing to go to the Vatican: \u201cHe had always wanted to work there,\u201d Father Peron said, adding that the monsignor \u201csaid he wanted to use the money to build a recovery facility for the terminally ill. But if I had to do that, I would use the money people give me for that purpose, not to buy a house in the center in Salerno, or to have real estate companies. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u2018I Am the One on the Cross\u2019In the 16 months after the monsignor\u2019s arrest, Pope Francis has made significant changes in the Vatican financial system. He created a secretariat for the economy and hired consulting firms to conduct reviews of the entire financial system. The Vatican Bank\u2019s fortifications against money laundering have been strengthened by closing many accounts and clarifying qualifications for account holders. The Financial Information Authority, the Vatican\u2019s financial watchdog, has also been revamped. The pope recently threw out the whole board of the F.I.A., replacing five Italians with experts from all over the world, including a Switzerland-based philanthropist, the former managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and a former counterterrorism adviser to President George W. Bush. But change from the board to the F.I.A.\u2019s operations may take more time. The authority still has only four employees, none of whom are anti-money-laundering experts. Mr. Ringguth said the authority \u201cneeds to engage additional staff with the appropriate training and experience so it can carry out its new tasks effectively.\u201dA former top representative at the F.I.A, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about this subject, said: \u201cNow the Vatican has a solid regulatory anti-money-laundering framework \u2014 yet we don\u2019t know if this would be enough to single out the next Scarano. Nor do we know how many Scaranos \u2014 actually far worse than Scarano himself \u2014 were there.\u201d The monsignor sees himself as a scapegoat. \u201cRight now, I am the one on the cross,\u201d he told me. When he feels that he is drowning, he said, he finds solace in the Gospel \u2014 and especially in two passages about money, wrongdoing and salvation. The first is the calling of Matthew \u2014 a former tax collector \u2014 by Jesus. The second is the parable of the prodigal son. In it, a boastful young man wastes half of his father\u2019s fortune, then repents and goes back to his family house, where his father is ready to embrace him again.The monsignor faces up to 20 years in prison, according to his lawyer. The monsignor himself played down the seriousness of the charges. The plan to repatriate $26 million from Switzerland, he told me back in December, \u201cwas just helping someone who needed a favor.\u201d He then stopped and leaned back on the sofa for a moment. He resumed speaking in a low tone: \u201cI am no saint, no. I am a sinner, like everyone else. I trusted the wrong people. I have been stupid. I made a mistake. That\u2019s it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Energy Boom Ends, a Political Identity Crisis in Alaska", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStates in PlayFAIRBANKS, Alaska \u2014 A gleaming $23 million complex of office buildings, dormitories and workshops has risen from the boreal forest just outside town over the last decade, aimed at training workers for a natural gas pipeline that was supposed to snake from the Arctic to serve energy markets around the world and make Alaska rich all over again.But the pipeline was never built, the victim of a worldwide glut of natural gas that has reduced demand for Alaska\u2019s supply. On a recent weekday afternoon, the meeting rooms and dorms were empty, with just one welding class breaking the silence on the Fairbanks Pipeline Training Center Trust\u2019s sprawling 63-acre campus.To make matters worse, the government tax dollars that built and sustained the complex are also in danger, amid pressure to cut spending in both Juneau, the state capital, and Washington. Not surprisingly, fears over what comes next are rising for residents, who saw the training center as the embodiment of their hopes for high-paying pipeline jobs.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there,\u201d said Jim Sampson, a former borough mayor and labor leader who is director of the training center. \u201cYou can feel it in the community and see it in the for-sale signs on the houses.\u201dEconomic anxiety in Alaska is roiling an already sharp-edged political season here, focused on one of the most competitive Senate races in the country: an endangered Democratic incumbent, Mark Begich, against a hard-charging Republican challenger, Dan Sullivan, a former state attorney general and natural resources commissioner.The worries start with energy extraction, for decades a pillar of the state\u2019s economy that provides about a quarter of its gross state product. These days, Alaska is producing and shipping less natural gas because of market forces, and pumping less oil from the aging wells in Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope, reducing jobs and tax revenues.In 2012, North Dakota surpassed Alaska in crude oil production, providing a psychological shock to Alaskans long accustomed to thinking of their state as second only to Texas on the energy frontier.At the same time, federal spending has tightened in the aftermath of the recession, a military drawdown and budget-cutting fervor in Washington. Despite its image of feisty independence, Alaska has long relied heavily on those dollars: It led the nation in per capita federal aid to state and local governments in 2010, the most recent data shows.That aid helped build roads, buildings and tiny rural airstrips across the state\u2019s vast expanses, while also providing well-paying jobs at 20 national parks, preserves and monuments, in numerous wildlife management programs and at nine major military bases.But bit by bit, economists, politicians and residents say, the realities of the decline of oil here and federal retrenchment are being felt as a kind of economic lethargy: Alaska was the only state where the total number of nonfarm jobs and gross domestic product both fell last year, even as the national economic recovery gained steam, according to the most recent federal figures.\u201cThings look pretty good, if you\u2019re just kind of looking superficially,\u201d said Jonathan King, an economist in Anchorage. \u201cIt\u2019s when you peel back and look at the guy behind the curtain you realize that you\u2019re not where you think you are. There\u2019s an unsettled feeling up here \u2014 when is the party over?\u201dThose difficult questions about the future are shaping the Senate contest. In a state long dominated by Republicans, Mr. Begich, a former Anchorage mayor who won his Senate seat in a tight three-way race in 2008, is widely regarded as an underdog against Mr. Sullivan, though many analysts also say the race is very close.Both men are evoking, in different ways, the rough seas ahead that each insists could imperil Alaska. Mr. Begich, a son of Alaskan schoolteachers, asserts that Senate seniority and carefully built relationships will enable him to work across partisan barricades to ensure the state gets its fair share of federal spending.Mr. Sullivan argues that he will protect the next wave of resource development in oil, gas or minerals from meddlesome regulators, the Obama administration and the Democratic leadership in the Senate that he says Mr. Begich is beholden to.Nick Melambianakis, 60, who came to Alaska from Greece during an earlier energy boom that led to construction of the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline in the 1970s, is among those uncertain about the best way forward.As Anchorage\u2019s Greek festival surrounded him with a syncopated dance beat from the stage and the smell of frying onions, Mr. Melambianakis described himself as a Republican, but one who has voted for Mr. Begich in the past and is undecided about his vote in November.\u201cAlaska is a great state, we have a lot of resources, but we need new figures and providers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then again, when you\u2019re choosing new people you\u2019re not sure. I want to take a risk, but I\u2019m scared.\u201dThe Sway of PracticalityAlaska might appear politically conservative, and measured by election results, especially on the presidential level, it is. It is the only state that has supported a Republican for president in every election since statehood except President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s landslide in 1964.But many Alaskans say that ideology is in fact a shallow measure of things here, and that hard-nosed practicality \u2014 what does Alaska need from the outside world and who is best at getting it \u2014 can often hold as much sway.The late Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican who lost to Mr. Begich in 2008 after 40 years in the Senate, defined the model of rainmaker, many Alaskans say. As his ability to slip federal dollars for highway projects, hospitals and bridges into legislation became legend, he helped fortify Republican dominance at both the state and federal level. In rural areas where jobs, not to mention roads, were few, pork meant progress.\u201cHe knew how to take care of us,\u201d said John Penayah, 50, an unemployed construction worker and truck driver, who was born on a remote Alaskan island and came to Anchorage as a child. Mr. Penayah, sitting in an Anchorage soup kitchen called Bean\u2019s Caf\u00e9 as a television blared on the wall, said that compared with leaders like Senator Stevens and former President Ronald Reagan, all politicians seem small to him, and that he does not plan to vote in November.For people like Mr. Penayah, the deeper Alaskan political brand is prickly independence and resistance to labels. Registered Republicans and Democrats are both only about half as big a percentage of the electorate here as in the rest of the nation, with independents in the majority. And the Tea Party, for all the panache that former Gov. Sarah Palin gave it in recent years on the national stage, is also less dominant here than in many other Republican-controlled states.The candidates for Senate are thus at least partly battling in the arena Mr. Stevens created, over questions he would likely ask: Which candidate can best provide? And who has the sharpest elbows to protect Alaska\u2019s interests?A frequently repeated line by Mr. Begich on the campaign trail, and a nod perhaps to Mr. Stevens, is that the money train of grants and payroll from Washington has barely slowed over the last six years on his watch.\u201cI\u2019m going to work with whoever can help Alaska \u2014 I don\u2019t care who they are, where they come from, who their party is,\u201d Mr. Begich said in an interview. Voters, he added, \u201crecognize what Senator Stevens did, but they also recognize where we are today.\u201dMr. Sullivan frames his role in a sharply different way, focusing not on bringing federal aid to Alaska, but on protecting the state from what he calls an obstructionist federal bureaucracy led by President Obama, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, and Mr. Begich himself.\u201cThe country clearly is going in the wrong direction,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said in an interview. \u201cThe federal government does not try to look at ways to partner with us, but they\u2019re trying to put more obstacles and delays in terms of opportunity \u2014 so that is an anxiety.\u201dBut it is not a fear of too much government that makes for a frequent buzz of conversation at Busy Beans Coffee in Anchorage, near the entrance to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, but rather the opposite \u2014 how much might the government shrink, and where?The total number of active duty military personnel has declined statewide by about 1,500 from a peak of 24,449 in 2009, according to state figures, and Elmendorf-Richardson is expected to lose hundreds more soldiers next year. But the Pentagon has also announced its intent to base two squadrons of F-35 fighter jets at Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks, a move that could bring hundreds of jobs and that Mr. Begich trumpets as proof of his prowess.\u201cIt\u2019s hanging over our heads,\u201d said M. K. Reeder, 23, a barista at Busy Beans, whose husband is a second lieutenant in the Army, about the talk of further cuts.The troubled trajectory of oil haunts Eric Weatherby, 38, a tech worker for an Anchorage company that supplies communications systems to the industry.Mr. Weatherby said he has seen a recent uptick in investment by oil companies on the North Slope oil fields, where he commutes for weeks of work at a time, more than 600 miles from home. But he worries that the improvement could be short-circuited by politics.\u201cAll the companies I work for were extremely worried,\u201d Mr. Weatherby said of the referendum. \u201cWe really need to get a hint and go, \u2018hey, there\u2019s other states and other countries that are charging less taxes and making it easier.\u2019 \u201dMr. Sullivan opposed repealing the tax overhaul, while Mr. Begich declined to take a stance, saying the decision should be left up to voters. Yet Mr. Weatherby said his vote in the Senate race remained undecided.A Wave of NewcomersThe long list of things that make Alaska different starts with two: the Arctic Circle, which belly-cinches the state and defines the stark seasons of darkness and light, and the immense stretches of roadless tundra and mountainscape that make human presence seem paltry.Difficulty in predicting elections is just another part of the terrain, with few reliable polls. But by some measures the historical differences between Alaska and the rest of the nation are also shrinking, amid economic changes and an influx of newcomers, especially young people who are ethnically more diverse, and more likely to want a townhouse apartment in Anchorage than a backwoods cabin.Alaska, along with other Western states, is deep red. But Alaskans are different from other red staters in important ways.The Great Recession did not cause widespread pain in Alaska, but it did produce a demographic tide, bringing newcomers like Shanna Zuspan, 37, and her husband, Jarrett, 40. After Mr. Zuspan lost his job as a home inspector in Sacramento, Calif., the couple drove north in 2010 with their son, Jack, who is now 5, looking for a new start in Alaska and to reconnect with family already here. The Zuspans brought their Democratic leanings, and their wounds, with them in relocating to Anchorage.\u201cWe still feel vulnerable because of what we experienced down there,\u201d said Ms. Zuspan, who works for a small consulting firm, helping organizations plan and apply for grants.\u201cBoth Alaska and Anchorage within it are evolving,\u201d said Eddie Hunsinger, the state demographer. \u201cI can\u2019t really say whether they\u2019re becoming closer or farther apart because they are integrated.\u201dBut an echo of Alaska\u2019s past is reverberating, too, in ways that could help Mr. Sullivan.Rheanna Freese, 21, a welding student, practiced on a piece of pipe at the\u00a0 Fairbanks Pipeline Training Center. The center was built with the aim of\u00a0 training workers for a natural gas pipeline that was supposed to make Alaska rich all over again. But it was never built.Alaska\u2019s greatest years of net in-migration coincided with the building of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in the 1970s \u2014 a vast engineering project that required highways, housing for thousands of workers and, of course, the skilled builders themselves, many of whom came from the oil patch states of Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.Between 1974 and 1976, more newcomers arrived than in any two years between the end of World War II and 2012, according to state figures. And as with the Zuspans, the wave of newcomers brought their politics with them \u2014 in this case, a more conservative outlook that pushed Alaska further to the right in the 1980s and especially since the 1990s.Now the children of the pipeline cohort are of voting age, and may be keeping to the conservative values they grew up with, some political experts say. A yearlong survey by Ivan Moore Research, an Anchorage group that works with Democrats and Republicans, found in 2004 that younger voters in Alaska described themselves as conservative in higher proportions than elsewhere in the country. That suggests the political legacy of the pipeline era, said the firm\u2019s owner, Mr. Moore.But whether the new or the old Alaska determines next month\u2019s election remains far from clear. Either way, Shanna Zuspan, a representative of the new, wants greater stability in the rocky present.\u201cWe just have this economy based on one industry, oil, and it\u2019s declining,\u201d said Ms. Zuspan, who worries she may have to move again if jobs continue to disappear. \u201cI think this could be the first election that people have recognized the uncertainty out there, and are thinking about it.\u201dStates in Play: Articles in this series are examining\nvoters and issues in seven\nstates with the most competitive\nSenate races.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why 2016 May Be Mitt Romney\u2019s Year", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byManager-in-ChiefOne of the main problems with Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential candidacy was that it was never clear what he wanted to do if elected.That didn\u2019t fly in 2012. But it might actually work pretty well in 2016.The 2012 election had to be about the big \u201cwhat is government for?\u201d questions because huge policy decisions loomed in 2013. The Affordable Care Act would be implemented, or not; parts of the Bush tax cuts would expire, or not; entitlements would be greatly reformed in an effort to shrink deficits, or not. A large fiscal adjustment was needed, if not right away, sometime within the next few years.Barack Obama defended the principle that government ought to take a strong and active role in the economy, by using fiscal policy to offset the effects of recessions, by regulating the financial sector more tightly, by offering a near-universal health care entitlement, and by taxing the rich more.That failure sounds like a good reason for Mr. Romney not to run again. But in 2016, he might actually be able to bracket the big ideological questions and run on the small stuff.The big questions from 2012 mostly got resolved in 2013. Tax rates went up, the spending cuts known as sequestration went into effect, and the Affordable Care Act is proceeding. The federal budget deficit has fallen below $500 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt will be stable as a share of the economy over the next decade. As a result, Congress will probably leave the federal budget more or less on autopilot for the next several years.While \u201cwhat will government do?\u201d was very much an open question in 2012, greater policy certainty means there will be more room to run on \u201cI\u2019ll be a better manager\u201d in 2016. That will be especially true if the news continues to be dominated by stories of managerial and technical failure in the government.Even the big scandal obsessions of the conservative fever swamps \u2014 the Benghazi attack, the I.R.S. scandals and Fast & Furious \u2014 are, after you strip away the conspiracy theories, fundamentally stories about managerial failure. And while foreign policy debates obviously have huge ideological components, there\u2019s a lot of room for dissatisfaction with this administration\u2019s execution on its strategies in Ukraine and the Middle East.Whether the increase in gaffes is real or just perceived, there have been a lot of news stories that might lead voters to say, \u201cGee, this looks like the sort of problem Mitt Romney might have handled better.\u201dOf course, to get to the point of making this case in a general election, Mr. Romney would first have to be renominated. The Republicans haven\u2019t renominated a losing presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1968, but then, no losing Republican nominee has sought renomination during that time either.In most of the last 50 years, there has been a clear heir apparent for the Republican nomination, whether a sitting vice president or a runner-up in a former primary campaign. The existence of a strong next-in-line candidate has been one reason not to try again. In this case, nobody is next in line. Especially if Jeb Bush does not run for the nomination, the Republican establishment figures who backed Mr. Romney in the last campaign will have no obvious place to go, putting him in an unusually good spot to seek renomination.Candidates run all the time on airy ideas about leadership and competence, and win. Look at Rick Snyder\u2019s election as governor of Michigan in 2010, or Mr. Romney\u2019s own election as governor of Massachusetts in 2002. It\u2019s standard to say Washington is \u201cdysfunctional,\u201d but that can mean several different things. If people mean the government has the wrong priorities, Mr. Romney has already shown his difficulty in convincing voters he has the right ones. But if people mean the government is not executing well on the priorities it has, Mr. Romney may find himself on favorable ground.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Picket Fence: Younger Adults Opting to Rent ", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA, Va. \u2014 On a recent sunny afternoon, a half-dozen grinding and spinning cement trucks helped lay the foundation for what many real estate developers see as the most promising housing opportunity in postrecession America: apartment living.Here in suburban Vienna, about 16 miles west of downtown Washington, Joshua Solomon\u2019s DSF Group is remaking a congested but nondescript intersection into a haven for young adults of the millennial generation. Like many other developers who survived the housing bust, he now expects a coming wave of renters who intend to stay that way for a while to help lead the industry to a brighter future.\u201cThat generation of folks has seen people really get hurt by homeownership,\u201d said Mr. Solomon, president of the company, which is based in Waltham, Mass. \u201cThe petal has really fallen off the rose as it pertains to homeownership. People don\u2019t want to be tied down to a mortgage they can\u2019t get out of quickly.\u201dThat is true of Cabell Dickinson, 30, who had rented an apartment in Arlington, Va., for eight years when she and her boyfriend decided in May to get more serious about their relationship. Instead of marrying and buying a home, however, they followed friends to Mr. Solomon\u2019s complex, known as Halstead Square, moving into a $2,000-a-month apartment.They often watch football in the lounge and have friends over for barbecues around the rooftop grill. \u201cI can pretty much do my whole life in the building,\u201d Ms. Dickinson said.The developer\u2019s bright red and yellow rental high rises \u2014 three already filled with young tenants \u2014 are a modern mix of glass, metal and fashionable ipe wood. The complex has fire pits and waterfalls, and each unit has a built-in iPod docking station hard-wired to speakers that pipe music throughout the apartment and link to TVs. When a fourth, 200-unit building is finished next year, it will have a residents-only bowling alley.Since 2008, the year Lehman Brothers collapsed and home prices dropped precipitously, there has been a steady increase in the number of people ages 18 to 34 renting instead of buying homes. About 875,000 more households are now made up of young adult renters than would have existed if the 2008-era trend had held steady, according to an analysis of census data by Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia, a real estate marketing website.Moreover, as the economy slowly improves and job growth picks up steam, the millions of 20- and 30-somethings who shared living quarters with friends or nestled in their parents\u2019 basements to ride out the economic shock waves from the Great Recession are beginning to branch out on their own. But they are still largely shut out of the mortgage market.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to go from living with their parents to buying a home,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, speaking at a housing conference in Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re going to rent an apartment.\u201dDevelopers and builders are responding to a rising demand not just from young adults but also from the larger population of Americans who do not have the means or the desire to buy a house.\u201cA lot of people 10 to 15 years ago who were able or willing to get a mortgage, now they can\u2019t,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThey\u2019re caught in an awful Catch-22 trying to get a down payment\u201d now that they\u2019re spending on rent.Mr. Zandi said the nation needed even more new rental units, especially affordable ones. Vacancy rates for rentals are as low as they have been in more than two decades, and the price of renting, in turn, is climbing.\u201cOur problem in the next three to five years isn\u2019t a surfeit of multifamily housing but a shortage,\u201d Mr. Zandi said.In California, SCM Construction Management Services built single-family homes for 30 years, but after the recession it began building rental complexes in the state\u2019s Central Valley region, which was hit hard with foreclosures, as well as the San Francisco Bay Area, which never really stopped growing.Renters abound in both regions, said Steve Mothersell Sr., president of SCM. Young, educated technology workers with good salaries want to live in San Francisco, where home prices are out of reach for all but dot-com millionaires. \u201cAnd out here in the Central Valley, we\u2019re seeing families come back together as kids are moving out after living with their parents,\u201d he said.Developers are zeroing in on the generation of people in their 20s and early 30s, who now outnumber baby boomers. Many new amenity-laden complexes are updated versions of the 1990s soap opera \u201cMelrose Place,\u201d where socializing takes place at bocce courts and outdoor movie theaters next to swimming pools.Developers are particularly creative in finding sites with cheaper land costs that give them the ability to offer more affordable near-luxury units. The Parkway Lofts in a scruffy neighborhood near a commuter train station in Bloomfield, N.J., opened in January and offers 17-foot ceilings, a roof deck and a movie screening room. \u201cIt\u2019s not your typical suburban, four-story, wood-built apartment building,\u201d said Eugene Diaz, principal at Prism Capital Partners, which developed the 361-unit building from an old multistory factory.Mr. Solomon\u2018s company, the DSF Group, has new apartment buildings on the outskirts of New York as well as a 445-unit complex in Danvers, Mass., near Boston. All locations were selected because of their proximity to public transit. His modern apartment buildings in Vienna are a short walk to the Washington Metro line.The Halstead Square apartments in Vienna, which rent for as much as $3,000 a month, include granite countertops and access to a smartphone app that allows residents to check on deliveries and request repairs. Focus groups of young people told the developer they want an almost hotel-like experience.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in this demographic is they are really looking for a Four Seasons level of service but without ever looking up from their iPhone,\u201d Mr. Solomon said.The buildings\u2019 lobbies are scented with a white tea and thyme fragrance. Residents can play a round of virtual golf in the 24-hour gym or go to Zumba and Brazilian Butt Lift classes on the basketball court. They can watch movies on plush couches arranged in stadium seating or let their dogs roam in a small dog park. The complex hosts wine tastings and cooking classes in common areas.\u201cEveryone gets together around the pool and plans for the rest of the night,\u201d said Gabriela Gomez, 36, who pays about $1,400 for her studio apartment.Ms. Dickinson, who moved in with her longtime boyfriend, said she expected to eventually put together a down payment so she could emulate her few home-buying friends.But she is in no hurry. And for now her savings are taking a beating: She has to buy gifts for the 13 weddings she has been invited to in the next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Halfway House", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Vladimir Yevtushenkov, an oligarch under house arrest in Moscow since mid-September on charges of money laundering, may or may not be guilty of any wrongdoing. But he is different from many of his ilk in one important way: He is one of the rare moguls who lives and pays taxes in Russia but directly owns a major stake in his London-listed company Sistema. The vast majority of his peers operate through chains of shell-companies that lead to obscure off-shore havens. Yevtushenkov had been thought to enjoy special protection. But the fate of the once-powerful billionaire, No. 15 on the Forbes list of Russia\u2019s richest men, has clearly changed. We will never know exactly why he lost favor \u2014 the infighting among high-power business and political figures is as obscure as ever. Russia is a halfway house. It has private companies, markets and all kinds of consumer wares, but it lacks crucial institutions that help us enjoy all those material goods. There are no such things as impartial courts, honest law enforcement or respect for the rules. Many Russian businesses are incorporated abroad for a reason. The ability to trade, transfer assets across borders and to come and go as you please were among the most visible post-Soviet achievements that stayed untouched under Vladimir Putin. Although he curtailed many other rights, including freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, borders stayed open. This was not because people wanted to travel freely, but because Russia\u2019s political system needed a vital safety valve. The lack of political clout from businesspeople and civil rights groups has allowed the Kremlin to respond quickly to isolated cases of resistance while staving off comprehensive reforms of the judiciary, the police and most public services. The pressure has been low because, paradoxically, Russia\u2019s business community has never really championed private property rights in any substantial way. Most businesses have long been registered in offshore jurisdictions, most entrepreneurs have long ago acquired foreign residency permits, and their money has been safely parked abroad. The elite have learned to use the education and healthcare systems of other nations while ignoring the deterioration of those services at home. Thus the Kremlin could afford to keep Russian institutions conveniently incomplete.\u201cThe people who are the most likely to be upset by the poor quality of governance in Russia are the very same people who are the most ready and able to exit Russia,\u201d the political scientist Ivan Krastev warned in the Journal of Democracy back in 2011. \u201cFor them, leaving the country in which they live is easier than reforming it. Why try to turn Russia into Germany, when there is no guarantee that a lifetime is long enough for that mission, and when Germany is but a short trip away?\u201d Relative ease of access to Western jurisdictions has prevented pressure within the Russian political system from growing. But this safety valve may soon malfunction. Moscow\u2019s moves on Ukraine, the West\u2019s response, and Putin\u2019s countersanctions have dealt a blow to Russia\u2019s openness. Opportunities for political, social and business integration are narrowing and some doors are being shut entirely. Various Western countries have placed roughly 100 Russians and a few dozen Russian and Crimean companies under direct sanctions. On its end, the Kremlin has been compiling blacklists of foreign officials, restricting food imports and introducing informal travel bans for some categories of its own citizens, mostly law-enforcement officials and judges. Parliament is preparing comprehensive legislation limiting foreign travel for all high-ranking officials. A draft law banning them from receiving medical treatment abroad was moved recently but failed to pass. Senior officials are already prohibited from opening and operating bank accounts in foreign financial institutions. But these measures are only the tip of the iceberg. Many Western banks have introduced internal restrictions on any business with Russia just to steer clear of potentially toxic assets. The access of Russian firms and lenders to foreign financing has been severely limited while they have to repay $134 billion in external debt before the end of 2015, according to the Russian Central Bank. Unless foreign sanctions are relaxed Russian companies will face a credit crunch in 2016, the ratings agency Moody\u2019s said recently. Ordinary individuals also have felt the bite of the sanctions and the general deterioration of the economic outlook. The ruble early this month reached historic lows against the dollar and the euro. Many Russians had to put plans for big purchases and foreign travel on hold. These are just some preliminary signs of things to come if Russia continues its drift toward isolation. The price of closing the channels of exchange with the West may prove huge not just for the economy but for the political system. If more businessmen are forced to abandon their Western havens the demand for the protection of their rights within Russia will grow dramatically. Theoretically, this may even lead to gradual improvement in the quality of courts and law enforcement. But in reality, the shadowy case against Mr. Yevtushenkov is a more likely example of what might ensue. (It appears that the Kremlin wants his conglomerate, Sistema, to spin off its Bashneft oil holdings to Rosneft, which is heavily in debt, particularly to the Chinese. Mr. Yevtushenkov objects, hence his house arrest.)Given the half-built state of the institutional system, isolation will make whatever legal protections Russians still possess an even more scarce resource. This, in turn, will lead to a heightened role for informal \u201cguarantors\u201d of property and safety \u2014 the Kremlin and the high-ranking security officials it relies on. These guarantees are always ambiguous. If Russia, helped by sanctions, closes its doors, the country will degenerate in wild infighting, the outcome of which it will be impossible to predict.

{"Headline": "The Hunt for Dividends May Shift to Europe", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFundamentallyFOR much of the past five years, a simple strategy for beating the market has been to focus on dividend-paying stocks.That\u2019s because the Federal Reserve has been holding down interest rates \u2014 by keeping short-term rates near zero while buying longer-term Treasuries. This drove yield-starved investors out of the fixed-income market and into dividend-paying equities with higher payouts.And when valuations on the highest-yielding areas of the stock market, like utilities, began to soar a couple of years ago, many investors tweaked their approach, shifting from the highest-yielding shares into those of companies that could consistently make their dividends grow.Today, market watchers fear that another transition is at hand \u2014 and that risks for dividend investors are climbing.What\u2019s more, the Fed plans to end its bond-buying program this month, and most members of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee say they expect to start raising short-term rates before the end of 2015.The implications of these Fed moves are clear: Short- and long-term rates could start to rise soon, which means that bond investors may no longer need to buy stocks in order to buttress their fixed-income yields. And that means dividend-paying stocks could suffer. This may already be happening. In the third quarter, the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Total Return index lost 3.2 percent of its value, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index of blue-chip stocks rose 1.1 percent. Even the SPDR S.&P. Dividend exchange-traded fund \u2014 which tracks an index of dividend-paying domestic companies that have raised payouts for at least 20 consecutive years \u2014 lost 1.6 percent. Although investors clearly aren\u2019t giving up on dividends, value-minded managers are searching more selectively for dividend-paying stocks still trading at reasonable prices.One place they are looking is overseas, particularly Europe, Ms. Lester said.The average stock fund that invests primarily in Europe lost 7.3 percent of its value in the third quarter, versus a gain of 0.04 percent for the average domestic blue-chip equity fund. That means valuations of European stocks, depressed for the last two years as a result of the region\u2019s slow growth, are even more depressed now. The price-to-earnings ratio for the MSCI Europe Index ended the third quarter at around 14, based on projected future earnings. That compares with 17 for the S.&P. 500. Moreover, European equities have traditionally returned more of their profits to shareholders. The dividend yield on European equities was 3.7 percent at the end of the third quarter, versus less than 2 percent for domestic stocks.Perhaps the strongest reason to consider Europe is that it is at a different point in its economic cycle than the United States. The American economy is showing signs of vigor, as gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the second quarter.In Europe, however, the economy is teetering on the edge of what could be yet another recession, and policy makers are racing to jump-start growth. The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, has indicated that it may provide even more stimulus to the economy \u2014 perhaps in the form of so-called quantitative easing, the policy used by the Fed for several years, with its outright purchases of fixed-income securities.The upshot is that the same policy prescription that drove yield-hungry investors into domestic dividend-paying stocks may begin to push them into such stocks in Europe.Mr. Gray points to BMW, which sells nearly as many luxury cars in the United States and China as it does in Europe. BMW shares yielded 3 percent at the end of the quarter, yet traded at a P/E ratio of less than 10, based on projected profits.Another example, he said, is the French energy giant Total, with its global operations and markets. The stock yielded more than 5 percent at the end of the quarter and traded at a P/E of around 11.In some ways, said Mr. Kirby at Thornburg, it makes more sense to invest in the absolute highest-yielding shares in Europe, like Total, because \u201cEurope is still in the early innings of its stimulus program and there\u2019s less concern about rates going up there.\u201dMoreover, if rates in the United States were to rise more than those in Europe, more investors would park their cash in dollars rather than euros, driving up the dollar\u2019s value. That, in turn, makes goods sold by European companies abroad more affordable to foreign buyers, which should lift their sales.\u201cThe holy grail,\u201d he said, \u201cwould be finding a European-domiciled high-yielder whose costs are based in Europe, but that exports mostly to the U.S.\u201d IN the United States, the calculus is very different.These are companies like Johnson & Johnson, the health care giant whose shares yield about 2.7 percent, \u201cthat raise their payout, on average, every year,\u201d she said.Other examples are companies that investors may not regard as traditional dividend sources, like Hasbro, the toy company. With a market value of around $7 billion, it is considered more of a medium-capitalization stock and not a big blue chip. \u201cNobody thinks of Hasbro as a dividend play,\u201d Ms. Kempler said, but it yields about 3 percent. Apple is another example, she said. Though not known as a dividend play, it yielded 1.8 percent at the end of the quarter, and has huge amounts of cash on its balance sheet, she said. That gives the company plenty of room to raise its dividend. Even if Apple is slow to do that, it still may deliver the type of earnings and revenue growth that traditional dividend payers rarely see.Paul J.

{"Headline": "LVMH Flaunts Its Billowing Gehry Trophy in Paris", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The luxury goods conglomerate LVMH showed off its foundation\u2019s new museum here on Friday, a vast center for contemporary art designed by Frank Gehry with silver, glass and aluminum sails billowing above the treetops of the Bois de Boulogne. Construction of the private museum has taken more than six years, at a reported cost of $135 million. The project is overseen by Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of the LVMH and the richest man in France.\u00a0The design grew out of a flurry of sketches in 2002 on an 11-hour flight to California, said Mr. Gehry, 85, who on Friday walked through the museum, savoring the sculpted views from every angle. The design is a \u201cwork in progress,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look finished purposely, and I think that invites people to interact with it over time.\u201dWith steady cutbacks in state spending on the arts in France in recent years, companies are playing a more ambitious role in cultural projects, and Mr. Arnault is clearly putting his mark on the French capital. When environmentalists opposing the museum project obtained a court order in 2011 to annul its building permit, lawmakers passed special legislation to declare the project in the public interest.\u00a0This week, Mr. Arnault prevailed again when a court ruled that work could resume on the demolition of La Samaritaine, a former department store on the city\u2019s Right Bank that LVMH purchased in 2001. Preservationists had objected to a design by the Japanese firm Sanaa for a new complex that includes a luxury hotel, designer stores, offices, and apartments and a wavy etched-glass facade on the side facing the rue de Rivoli.Mr. Arnault , who attended the preview on Friday, has said that his interest in commissioning a work by Mr. Gehry dates back to 2001, when he saw the architect\u2019s Guggenheim Bilbao museum in Spain.\u00a0The 126,000-square-foot center formally opens on Oct. 27. Admission will be free for a few days and then rise to 14 euros (nearly $18) for an adult, compared with the 12 euros charged by the Louvre for viewing its permanent collection.\u00a0It includes 11 galleries and a soaring auditorium where the pianist Lang Lang and the band Kraftwerk are booked for an inaugural performance. Mr. Gehry, whose name is inextricably linked to the \u201cBilbao effect,\u201d a sense that ambitious architecture can buoy a local economy, said he was unsure whether the Paris center would yield similar benefits. But he noted that the city of Bilbao experienced immediate financial gains after the museum opened there in 1997.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a real life there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear it came from this one building. But that\u2019s Bilbao \u2014 Paris isn\u2019t exactly a sleepy little industrial town.\u201d\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Getting Real About China", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorChina\u2019s harsh suppression of political dissent, from Hong Kong to Xinjiang, and its close ties to Russia, Iran and North Korea, have finally laid to rest the dream many Western leaders have had since the 1990s: that \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d would eventually, inevitably lead to more openness and democracy.Instead, the opposite has occurred: China is more confident, more assertive, and also more closed. Thirty-five years after Deng Xiaoping freed up the economy, the Communist Party is using material prosperity and nationalist ideology to maintain its legitimacy in the face of the wrenching social tensions. It has rejected both the move toward democracy and the acceptance of human and civil rights that Americans had hoped would emerge from China\u2019s astonishing economic rise. Even more worrisome, China\u2019s foreign policy relies on keenly calculated self-interest, at the expense of the international institutions, standards and obligations the United States has sought to champion. It increasingly views the United States as a rival and potential adversary.What went wrong?In the late 1970s, when the United States and China fully normalized relations, Beijing sought a strategic partnership with Washington, to deter a perceived Soviet threat. By the late 1980s, China was unconcerned about the Soviets, though willing to listen and learn from the United States military. The Chinese were especially impressed by our prowess in the 1991 Persian Gulf war. All the while, China built its agricultural, industrial and technological strength; military modernization was a second-tier priority. As late as 2005, China\u2019s admiration for the United States \u2014 and awareness of its own rising power \u2014 were such that a young, well-connected Communist Party leader told me, \u201cChina knows that you and Britain were best friends, and Britain gave you leadership of the world; China wants to be America\u2019s best friend, so you will give us leadership of the world.\u201dIf there was a turning point in China\u2019s assessment of America, it could be found in the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. While still respectful of our military might, China began to see the United States as a failing system, with a debt-saddled economy and a dysfunctional government, vulnerable to being replaced as the world\u2019s leader. In 2011, a well-placed Chinese associate told me that the country\u2019s new leadership intended to dominate the South China Sea; that its regional rivals, like Vietnam, would bow to its ambitions or \u201cbe taught a lesson\u201d; and that if the United States interfered, our assets would be targeted.By 2013, this associate\u2019s warnings had become even more ominous: \u201cWe can see your stealth aircraft\u201d; \u201cwe have our own GPS and can shoot down yours\u201d; \u201cwe know your technologies from all your companies and from NASA, because Chinese scientists work these for you\u201d; \u201cyou will not have any military relations with the Philippines unless we allow it, because China provides them $3.5 billion per month in remittances through Hong Kong\u201d; \u201cChinese shipyards are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week\u201d; \u201cmore than 30 ships were launched between October 2012 and April 2013\u201d; \u201cby 2019 China will have four aircraft carriers deployed.\u201dChina doesn\u2019t seek conflict \u2014 it can achieve most of its goals by adroitly combining traditional diplomacy with its vast economic power. But neither will it avoid conflict. It has in the past used its military \u201cpre-emptively\u201d rather than defensively. A danger is that an ascendant China seeking recognition of its power and rights, will, whether deliberately or through miscalculation, spark conflict.But the deeper strategic problem for America is China\u2019s more fundamental challenge to the global architecture of trade, law and peaceful resolution of disputes that the United States and its allies created after World War II. China\u2019s strategic rise \u2014 patient, nuanced and farsighted \u2014 threatens all of this. Just as the United States has sought the worldwide adoption of democratic values and American norms for international behavior, China will seek structures and relationships that support Communist Party rule at home, and its policy that countries should not intervene in one another\u2019s affairs.The ascendancy of naked and direct self-interest as an organizing principle would mean a fundamental weakening of Western institutions and values, including the rule of law. This would be a step backward, toward 19th-century ideas of the balance of power and spheres of influence. The question, as Henry A. Kissinger has framed it, is \u201cwhether China can work with us to create an international structure in which, perhaps for the first time in history, a rising state has been incorporated into an international system and strengthened peace and progress.\u201dIn analyzing China, the United States must look beyond historical parallels. In scale, China\u2019s economic growth, and the challenge it presents, is vastly greater than that of Japan in the 1980s. A century ago, Germany was an ascending power willing to wage war, but it never had the population or industrial capacity of the United States, or, until the 1930s, the leadership of a single political party, above the rule of law. Nor is China like the Soviet Union, economically isolated from the larger world. There is no historical precedent.For over two decades, the American strategy toward China has balanced between \u201cengagement\u201d and \u201ccontainment,\u201d a version of American policy toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The Obama administration\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia, announced in late 2011, was perceived as being directed against China, a shift toward containment. The United States has not only shifted forces but also updated defense treaties as part of this pivot. The United States is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an effort to create a large free-trade zone encompassing 11 other countries, but not China.As China presses its territorial claims on the South China Sea and East China Sea more forcefully \u2014 including even a claim, in some quarters, of jurisdiction over Okinawa, where American forces are based \u2014 the United States is being drawn into regional controversies. In the past few years we have found ourselves courted by Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries in the region, which are anxious for reassurance and support against China\u2019s new assertiveness, but also wary of provoking it. It will be in China\u2019s interest to force us progressively to choose, on issue after issue, between China and the interests of our allies in the region.The United States will emphasize multilateral forums for resolving disputes through international law, and fulfill our commitments to allies. China, in contrast, views this international order and these formalized obligations as being heavily tilted against it.We should be under no illusions about the difficult road ahead. China operates on a long-term vision, driven by its own interests. By some estimates, China\u2019s gross domestic product could surpass that of the United States sometime in the next decade. By then, Chinese military strength \u2014 including aircraft carriers, land-based aviation, submarines, and ballistic missile technologies, all of which could be directed against American aircraft carriers in the East and South China Seas \u2014 will be formidable. Even without any military confrontation, the balance of power in the western Pacific will shape the Chinese predisposition to push, threaten or compromise.The Chinese must understand that their expanding military capabilities have consequences. For example, the United States must not rule out the need to strengthen its ballistic missile defense system, as China rattles its intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities. We should be very candid in explaining this to the Chinese. China is closely observing events in Ukraine, and what our statements and actions there may mean for Asia. We must help China understand that a closer, more assertive alignment with Russia will only provoke the United States and our allies. The pivot to Asia makes sense, but must not come at the expense of our obligations to our allies in Europe and elsewhere.Even more important, America must work to persuade China that its interests lie not in narrow self-aggrandizement, like expanding its territorial reach, but in assuming shared responsibility for global leadership, commensurate with its wealth and power. The institutions of global governance \u2014 the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the like \u2014 have not been perfect, but they remain the best framework for securing peace and prosperity around the world. A China that turns its back on these institutions will find itself isolated and defensive, no matter how great its economic and military might.While Americans should hope that China embraces democracy and human rights in the long term, in the short run, we must accept that China has a right to its own system of government and its own standards for political legitimacy and social justice. The United States should insist that China, like every other member of the United Nations, abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We must help China see a distinction between its principle of \u201cnoninterference in internal matters of other states\u201d and respect for basic human rights and dignity. (For our part, we must also demonstrate our own acceptance of the responsibilities of global leadership by, for example, joining the International Criminal Court and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.) But we cannot assume that political development in China will happen as quickly as Americans would like.The view, increasingly prevalent in China, that it will inevitably replace the United States as the world\u2019s leading power is far from assured. Our natural resources, the rule of law, our entrepreneurial culture, and our vast head start in higher education and science are strong factors in our favor. People from all over the world want to live and work in the United States \u2014 including wealthy Chinese. They seek the protection of our laws and the individual freedoms they find here. China does not provide these attractions.If we are to retain our global leadership, and be a constructive, countervailing force as China rises, America needs a long-term strategic vision of our own: a strong, growing economy built on a foundation of energy independence; a vibrant, effective democracy; assertive, patient diplomacy backed by supportive allies; and a military capable of standing toe to toe with China in a crisis. With these pieces in place, we can succeed in helping China assume its rightful place as a global leader, and perhaps an equal of the United States, in a manner that promotes global prosperity and stability. Perhaps then China\u2019s leaders will feel secure enough to grant real democracy to its people. But it will be a long journey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Draft Budget Aims to Ease Austerity Measures", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 After four years of austerity, the Greek government on Monday heralded a series of tax cuts and benefits in a draft budget forecasting a steady return to growth as it moved to shore up its flagging popularity and avert early general elections.The economy, which has shrunk by a quarter since 2008, is expected to grow 2.9 percent in 2015 \u2014 buoyed by an increase in consumption, tourism and exports this year \u2014 after a contraction of 3.9 percent in 2013, according to the budget. It was presented in Parliament by Finance Minister Gikas Hardouvelis.With a projected budget deficit of 0.2 percent of gross domestic product next year, Mr. Hardouvelis\u2019s blueprint is essentially the first balanced budget presented by Greece in several decades. Included in the package of promised relief are 30 percent reductions in both a tax on heating oil and on a so-called solidarity levy on income.The pledges to ease up on austerity come as an increasing number of countries, including France and Italy, challenge the strict fiscal discipline championed by Germany.Greece\u2019s budget still requires the approval of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, known as the troika, whose representatives have been in Athens since last week inspecting the government\u2019s progress in enforcing economic overhauls.The troika of creditors has extended Greece two loan programs worth 240 billion euros, or about $300 billion, since 2010 in exchange for painful austerity measures that have slashed households\u2019 income by a third and pushed unemployment to 27 percent.The troika is not the only obstacle. In the midst of mounting political and social tensions, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras on Monday requested a parliamentary vote of confidence in his government.The move is a bid to secure the backing of wavering coalition lawmakers and to quash mounting speculation about early elections as the leftist opposition party Syriza, which opposes the onerous terms of Greece\u2019s bailouts, is leading in opinion polls. Syriza has pledged to block the government\u2019s candidate for president in an election scheduled for February, a move that would lead to snap elections.The vote of confidence is scheduled for Friday after three days of debate in Parliament, where the coalition has a slim majority of four seats.Independent economic analysts said that the draft budget presented by Greece was ambitious and likely to be revised by the troika, adding that growth figures have been inflated by the French and Italian authorities, too.However, Greek political instability could encourage foreign auditors to make some concessions, probably allowing the tax cuts to remain in place.\u201cIt is unlikely the troika will back down on structural reforms Greece is still pursuing, but they have to give Samaras some rope,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, a director at the London-based Eurasia Group, referring to a pending second overhaul of the pension system and to changes in the labor market.With the markets paying attention to Greece again in view of the political upheaval, the government is likely to win backing for its fiscal policy, Mr. Rahman said.\u201cIt is easier for creditors to work with a New Democracy-led government than a Syriza-led administration,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Samaras\u2019s conservative party, which leads the fragile coalition. Mr. Rahman noted, however, that there was a sense that Syriza was \u201cmoving towards the center.\u201dIn addition to the proposed tax cuts, the government promised an increase in the number of installments in which Greeks can pay off tax debts to the state. The authorities have also set aside \u20ac541 million to reverse cuts to the salaries and pensions of Greek judges and of employees of the police and armed forces.The country\u2019s level of debt, the highest in Europe, is expected to fall to 168 percent of G.D.P., from 175 percent this year.Describing the apparent upturn as \u201cthe result of the unprecedented sacrifices of Greek society, households and businesses,\u201d Mr. Hardouvelis said the government was in a position to introduce \u201cthe gradual lightening of tax burdens on citizens\u201d after six years of \u201cdeep and protracted recession.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin and the Pope", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReading the papers these days I find that the two world leaders who stir the most passion in me are Pope Francis and Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia. One is everything you\u2019d want in a leader, the other everything you wouldn\u2019t want. One holds sway over 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, the other over nine time zones. One keeps surprising us with his capacity for empathy, the other by how much he has become a first-class jerk and thug. But neither can be ignored and both have an outsized influence on the world today.First, the pope. At a time when so many leaders around the world are looking to promote their political fortunes by exploiting grievances and fault lines, we have a pope asking his flock to do something hard, something outside their comfort zone, pushing them to be more inclusive of gays and divorced people.Yes, Francis was rebuffed by conservative bishops at a recent Vatican synod when he asked them to embrace the notion that \u201chomosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community,\u201d adding, \u201care we capable of welcoming these people, guaranteeing to them a fraternal space in our communities?\u201d\u201cHostile inflexibility?\u201d Whose leadership does that describe? Look at Putin\u2019s recent behavior: His military was indirectly involved in downing a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine and his K.G.B. has not only been trying to take a bite out of Ukraine but is nibbling on Estonia, Georgia and Moldova, all under the guise of protecting \u201cRussian speakers.\u201dI opposed NATO expansion because I believed that there are few global problems that we can solve without the help of Russia. By expanding NATO at the end of the Cold War, when Russia was weak, we helped to cultivate a politics there that would one day be very receptive to Putin\u2019s message that the West is ganging up on Russia. But, that said, the message is a lie. The West has no intention of bringing Ukraine into NATO. And please raise your hand if you think the European Union plans to invade Russia.Yet Putin just exploits these fears for two reasons. First, he has a huge chip on his shoulder \u2014 no, excuse me; he has a whole lumberyard there \u2014 of resentment that Russia is no longer the global power it once was. But rather than make Russia great again by tapping its creative people \u2014 empowering them with education, the rule of law and consensual politics to realize their full potential \u2014 he has opted for the shortcut of tapping his oil and gas wells and seizing power from his people.And instead of creating a Russia that is an example to its neighbors, he relies on the brute force that his oil and gas can still buy him. While he rails against NATO, he is really afraid of European Union expansion \u2014 that Ukrainians would rather embrace the E.U. market and democracy rules than their historical ties to Russia because they know that through the E.U. they can realize potentials that would never be possible with Russia.By seizing Crimea and stoking up nationalism, Putin was not protecting Russia from NATO. He was protecting himself from the viruses of E.U. accountability and transparency, which, if they took hold in Ukraine, could spread to Moscow, undermining his kleptocracy.Normally, I wouldn\u2019t care, but when the world is dividing between zones of order and disorder, and the world of order needs to be collaborating to stem and reverse disorder, the fact that Putin is stoking disorder on Russia\u2019s borders, and not collaborating to promote order in the Middle East, is a real problem. What\u2019s more worrying is that the country he threatens most is Russia. If things go bad there \u2014 and its economy is already sagging under Western sanctions \u2014 the world of disorder will get a lot bigger.\u201cThe best leaders don\u2019t set timid and selfish goals that are easy to meet but instead set bold and inclusive goals that are hard to achieve,\u201d remarked Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics, who has just written a book on leadership, \u201cFully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all looking for ways to make sense of a world without a center, but we\u2019ll only find that in people who lead with authentic humility and reckless generosity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Elections Approach, a Desire to Roll Up the Welcome Mat", "Date": "2014-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From BritainBritain\u2019s efforts to restrict immigration have become \u201ca very, very large obstacle\u201d to hiring the best scientists, he said. \u201cWe should be thinking hard about making Britain a more welcoming place.\u201dThat is precisely the opposite of the current mood in Britain, seven months before an election, where immigration, the economy and the health service are the hottest issues.Before the elections in 2010, David Cameron, now prime minister, had vowed to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year by 2015, including migrants from within the European Union, which has a fundamental principle that all citizens may live and work in any member country. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to reduce the figure to tens of thousands.But there is a long and awkward way to go. While the government has set targets, it has little control over the variables. In the year ended March 2014, the government reports, 265,000 non-European Union citizens moved to Britain, ending a steady decline since the recent peak of 334,000 in 2011. Net immigration to Britain from the European Union rose to 130,000 in the year through March, up from 75,000 two years ago.Total net immigration in the year through March was 243,000. That is back up to the 10-year average of nearly a quarter of a million people, said Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch U.K., which advocates restrictions. \u201cIf allowed to continue,\u201d he said, the population will increase by 12 million \u2014 two more Scotlands \u2014 in 20 years. \u201cThat\u2019s huge,\u201d he said, arguing that three-quarters of British voters \u201cwant to see it reduced.\u201dSo immigration is a fertile topic for the right and for the nationalist U.K. Independence Party, which is squeezing Mr. Cameron, and it is so sensitive with voters that even the opposition Labour Party has little to say about it.By-elections are famous for protest votes that don\u2019t usually carry over to the general election. But UKIP, an essentially English nationalist party, is making headway against both main parties on the issues of sharply reducing immigration and quitting the European Union. Britain is an attractive place to live and find work, said Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Not only that, as a colleague, Heather Rolfe, points out, Britain benefits in the long run from immigrants, who provide flexibility for employers and pay more in taxes than they take from public funds.Even Philip Hammond, the Conservative foreign secretary, was slightly abashed on the subject at the recent party conference. Britain should be proud of being so attractive, he conceded. \u201cBut we are answerable to an electorate which is uncomfortable with destabilizing mass immigration.\u201dSetting a target is a bad idea, Mr. Portes said, since no country can control emigration and Britain cannot now control immigration from the European Union. \u201cAnd then the British labor market has performed very well\u201d to create jobs, unlike in Continental Europe, \u201cso the goal turned from almost impossible to impossible.\u201dAt the party conference, Mr. Cameron vowed to negotiate limits on European migration, saying that he \u201cwould not take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer.\u201d But as Mr. Green pointed out, \u201cHe didn\u2019t say what the question was.\u201dAfter meeting Mr. Cameron in London last week, Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France said freedom of movement and labor were treaty commitments, and that the European Union had other priorities, like growth and jobs.It might be possible for Mr. Cameron to get a deal limiting migration from any new members, but there are none on the horizon. What would help Mr. Cameron is to change the rules for existing members, but as Mr. Valls pointed out, that is \u201cunrealistic\u201d and would be opposed by many. The other option, of course, is the nuclear one favored by the U.K. Independence Party and about 100 of Mr. Cameron\u2019s own members of Parliament: to leave the European Union altogether.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly paraphrased from comments by Jonathan Portes. He said no country could control emigration, not immigration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Merkel Hints at Economic Policy Shift in Germany", "Date": "2014-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Germany in fact gives itself a bit more spending latitude, it would no doubt fuel the demands from its eurozone neighbors, most notably France, to have more budgetary flexibility to stimulate their own economies.Mainly, though, its neighbors are counting on Germany to lead by example.As the biggest economy in the 18-member eurozone and the one that in recent years was growing enough to at least partly offset economic softness elsewhere in the region, Germany drives demand in the bloc. Other countries in the region have watched with growing alarm as indicators have suggested that the standard-bearer might be stumbling. International economists have repeatedly called for Germany to stop worrying about balancing its budget and instead invest in economic stimulus.On Thursday, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said in effect that eurozone countries that have enough money should spend it \u2014 a clear reference to Germany.His comments echoed remarks this week from Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.Discouraging data in recent days, as well as a warning on Thursday by the nation\u2019s leading economic institutes that German growth was slowing, also seem to have increased Ms. Merkel\u2019s willingness to listen to the advice of Mr. Draghi and Ms. Lagarde.Faced with what she acknowledged were \u201csomewhat worsened\u201d forecasts for the German economy, Ms. Merkel said her government was examining how to encourage investment, particularly in the \u201cdigital sphere\u201d and the energy sector.Ms. Merkel did not elaborate, but she could have been referring to ways the government could encourage more Internet start-ups. Germany, like Europe in general, has never produced anywhere near as much digital innovation as the United States or South Korea.The reference to energy suggested a new push to Germany\u2019s program to abandon nuclear power and expand renewable energy sources. It might be a recognition, too, that lower energy costs in the United States have been luring away investment by German companies. While energy prices in Europe have fallen recently, the region is highly dependent on imported gas and oil, often from countries like Russia or in the Middle East that are unstable partners.The German national statistics office said on Thursday that exports slumped 5.8 percent in August compared with July, more than expected. It was the sharpest drop since 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. And it was the latest in a series of indications that Germany\u2019s export-driven economy was losing momentum, in part because the conflict in Ukraine has made businesses cautious and unwilling to invest.American policy makers and economists increasingly are worried that Europe\u2019s economic problems will weigh on domestic growth by reducing demand for exports from the United States and by suppressing price inflation.Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Thursday that the Fed was watching closely, but it was premature to consider policy adjustments.\u201cWe have to take into account the impact on aggregate demand,\u201d Mr. Fischer said at the Brookings Institution, where he shared the stage with Mr. Draghi. \u201cWe\u2019ll be judging what\u2019s happening to output and inflation, and acting on that basis.\u201dIn Berlin, Ms. Merkel said her government, a grand coalition of the political center-right and center-left, had discussed the economy at a meeting late on Tuesday.\u201cThis course we will now pursue very decisively, and also discuss within Europe,\u201d she added, apparently referring to a meeting of European Union leaders later this month in Brussels.Ms. Merkel\u2019s remarks may have been less a declaration of policy change than a signal that her thinking on stimulus was evolving.Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, speaking in Washington on Thursday, insisted that \u201cwriting checks\u201d was no way for the eurozone to increase growth, according to Reuters. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble urged France and Italy to do more to overhaul their economies instead.His statement could indicate that Germany\u2019s willingness to deploy fiscal stimulus might depend on whether its eurozone partners did their part by deregulating their labor markets and making other politically painful changes to encourage entrepreneurship.It is clear in any case that the debate in Europe has shifted away from single-minded emphasis on budgetary austerity. Mr. Draghi has also become increasingly frank in expressing the European Central Bank\u2019s determination to use all the powers at its disposal to reverse a slide in inflation to levels considered dangerously low.In his remarks in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Draghi said he was optimistic that eurozone political leaders would undertake difficult economic changes, because their survival depended on it.\u201cIt seems to me that now all of these governments have a very powerful incentive to do the right things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is: If they don\u2019t do the right things, they will disappear forever from the political scene because they will not be re-elected.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s remarks in Berlin came after four of Germany\u2019s most respected economic institutes revised their projections for growth sharply downward. Gross domestic product this year is expected to expand 1.3 percent, compared with a forecast of 1.9 percent six months ago, the institutes said in a joint statement. Next year, growth is forecast at 1.2 percent instead of a previous 2 percent, they added. Along the way, they predicted, the German economy will show zero growth for the current quarter and will barely eke out 0.1 percent growth in the fourth quarter.Separately, some economists are predicting a quarter or two of contraction before German growth resumes.German leaders have faced criticism for their obsession with reducing the budget deficit at a time when the country is able to borrow money at record low rates, and when roads, bridges and university campuses are deteriorating. At times, German bonds have carried negative interest rates, meaning investors are effectively willing to pay the government to keep their money safe.Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sch\u00e4uble have a habit of hinting at policy shifts almost in asides before announcing action. The chancellor\u2019s remarks on Thursday came in response to a question about economic prospects, at a news conference with the new prime minister of Poland, Ewa Kopacz.Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I kind of vaguely sort-of maybe half-knew, and that was embarrassing. I didn\u2019t know what they meant until I was in my late 40s.\u201d Mr. Lanchester, now 52, was speaking over lunch at Delmonico\u2019s, an old-school restaurant of dark wood paneling, hushed conversation and big slabs of meat in the heart of the New York financial district. Outside, the stock market was having what appeared to be some kind of seizure. If you were just an innocent bystander, so to speak, it was hard to understand what was happening, other than that it was not good at all. \u201cThere is a gigantic gap between them and us \u2014 people who understand these forces and this language, and the rest of us,\u201d Mr. Lanchester said. So, back around the time of the 2008 crisis, he embarked on a self-taught immersion course in the language and mechanics of money. \u201cThe first obstacle, and the main obstacle, was the words themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to admit if you literally don\u2019t know what a word means.\u201d So he began to ask and ask, and ask again. He shares his findings in \u201cHow to Speak Money: What the Money People Say \u2014 And What It Really Means,\u201d out this week from W. W. Norton & Company. In it, he explains some of the barriers to understanding, lays out the case for financial literacy and then provides an essential glossary of terms for those who would like to achieve this happy state. Here we find easy-ish concepts (amortization) harder ones (credit default swap, high-frequency trading) and ones we know are super-important in some complicated but confusing way (Libor: the London Interbank Offered Rate).And yes, also included are those pesky terms fiscal and monetary. For the record: \u201c\u00a0\u2018Fiscal\u2019 means to do with tax and spending, and it is controlled by the government; \u2018monetary\u2019 means to do with interest rates, and it is controlled by the central bank,\u201d he writes. But Mr. Lanchester wanted to put the research he did for \u201cCapital\u201d to good use, and he did not want it to clog up that novel or any others. (He is about to start work on a new one.) \u201cThe thing about research is that you end up using it whether you should or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not careful, I\u2019ll have scenes in a novel where, you know, \u2018As Nigel looked out his office window towards the lights of Canary Wharf in the distance, he struggled to remember the definition of a collateralized debt obligation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d So in 2010 he published \u201cI.O.U.: Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay,\u201d as succinct an account of the world\u2019s financial mess as you are likely to find. The British critic Tim Adams said in an email that \u201calong with Michael Lewis, I think John is the best we have at describing how Wall Street and the square mile of the City of London hijacked the world\u2019s economy to feed itself,\u201d adding that \u201chis writing may have the economic erudition of The Financial Times or The Wall Street Journal, but his satirical intent quietly laces every sentence and observation.\u201d Mr. Lanchester then began writing about finance and business for The London Review of Books \u2014 where he is known, Mr. Adams said, as \u201cthe pre-eminent polymath\u201d in a field crowded with them \u2014 and found he was suddenly in demand as an explicator and demystifier in the news media and as a public speaker. After he wrote \u201cI.O.U.\u201d (British title: \u201cWhoops!\u201d), he said, \u201cI thought: \u2018That\u2019s it. I\u2019m never writing about money ever again. I\u2019m done.\u2019\u00a0\u201d But he found could not get away from it. \u201cAs tabloid journalists say in Britain, no is just an emotional way of saying yes,\u201d Mr. Lanchester said. The language of money is full not just of off-putting aphorisms, incomprehensible jargon and obscure technical terms, but also of what Mr. Lanchester calls reversification, in which words mean something suspiciously like the opposite of what they ought to mean. For example, you might think \u201csecuritization\u201d would have \u201csomething to do with security or reliability,\u201d Mr. Lanchester writes. But you would be wrong. It describes \u201cthe process of turning something \u2014 and in the world of finance it can be pretty much anything \u2014 into a security,\u201d he writes. That is, a \u201cfinancial instrument that can be traded as an asset,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou\u2019ll never find a memo where they say, \u2018Hee hee hee, let\u2019s use all these complicated words that civilians can\u2019t understand,\u201d Mr. Lanchester said. \u201cSometimes there is intent, and sometimes there isn\u2019t, but it\u2019s moot. The crucial thing is the effect on outsiders, which is systematically excluding.\u201d Mr. Lanchester said he believes that even the scared and the clueless have the capacity to understand financial language, if they can just get over their psychological problems. \u201cMost people\u2019s default setting is that they would prefer never to think about money,\u201d he went on. He likened it to a \u201cPeanuts\u201d cartoon in which Charlie Brown talks wistfully about being a child in the back seat of a car and not having to worry about anything because \u201cyour parents are in the front seat, and they do all the worrying.\u201d \u201cThe trouble is,\u201d Mr. Lanchester said, \u201cwe\u2019re in the front seat of the car.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "LEDs, Energy Efficiency and Consumption", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus say there\u2019s a problem with energy efficiency \u2014 increases in consumption, or \u201crebounds,\u201d will undo its benefits \u2014 yet they also praise energy efficiency. Their point is unclear.Energy efficiency improvements are not instead of advancing energy supply; they complement it. With population and economic growth, including much-needed poverty reduction in developing countries, the world\u2019s energy consumption will rise. The issue is by how much and at what cost to the environment and public health.Energy efficiency\u2019s goal isn\u2019t absolute reduction in energy use. It is to use energy more productively and cleanly. Without efficiency improvements since the 1970s, the United States\u2019 economy would need over 50 percent more energy to achieve current gross domestic product, with concomitant cost, energy security and environmental impacts.The energy needed and pollution emitted to make a ton of steel, heat a home, drive to Grandma\u2019s or watch a video continue to decrease. Energy-efficient technologies beget other benefits too; in the case of LEDs, better quality and performance and, in developing countries, replacing dirty kerosene lamps and diesel generators with solar-powered lighting.Energy efficiency is a win-win. So what\u2019s the problem with energy efficiency?The writer is director of research and regulatory affairs for the Alliance to Save Energy.\u00a0To the Editor:The quest for fire, and hence for light, is a defining characteristic of humankind. Far from being a problem, making light cheaper and more efficient is good news all around.While the rebound effect has been known for over a century, we also know its limits. In the case of developed countries, there\u2019s only so much lighting one can consume \u2014 you don\u2019t add more lamps in the living room after replacing an inefficient bulb with an LED.For billions of light-starved citizens in the developing world, lower costs will speed the journey from darkness \u2014 and that is a very good thing. What\u2019s more, efficiency helps solve a core dilemma of climate protection: how developing countries can grow their economies without following the emissions-intensive path we did.Energy inefficiency is never good. Focusing on the \u201cbackfire\u201d is a mere distraction. LEDs alone won\u2019t solve global warming or global poverty, but they are a step in the right direction for both.Mr. Wagner is lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, and Mr. Gillingham is an assistant professor of economics at Yale.\u00a0To the Editor:Michael Shellenberger and Rod Nordhaus take a small dollop of fact and stretch it beyond recognition. It is true that LED lighting will permit many people in developing countries who live in underlit homes to upgrade their lighting. But since LED lighting is roughly six times more efficient than incandescents, lighting energy use will go up only if the average household increases the amount of light it uses by 600 percent. That\u2019s an unlikely possibility, even in many developing countries. And it\u2019s very unlikely to happen in developed countries like the United States, where homes are already well lit.Mr. Shellenberger and Mr. Nordhaus go even further by claiming that many other energy-efficiency investments suffer this supposed fatal flaw of leading to increased energy use, something that numerous studies over many years have refuted. LED lighting is an innovative tool in the energy efficiency arsenal, which includes a huge variety of proven technologies and strategies that any nation, including developing ones, can use to create a cleaner and more prosperous future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investigation Into Missing Iraqi Cash Ended in Lebanon Bunker ", "Date": "2014-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Not long after American forces defeated the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein in 2003, caravans of trucks began to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on a regular basis, unloading an unusual cargo \u2014 pallets of shrink-wrapped $100 bills. The cash, withdrawn from Iraqi government accounts held in the United States, was loaded onto Air Force C-17 transport planes bound for Baghdad, where the Bush administration hoped it would provide a quick financial infusion for Iraq\u2019s new government and the country\u2019s battered economy.Over the next year and a half, $12 billion to $14 billion was sent to Iraq in the airlift, and an additional $5 billion was sent by electronic transfer. Exactly what happened to that money after it arrived in Baghdad became one of the many unanswered questions from the chaotic days of the American occupation, when billions were flowing into the country from the United States and corruption was rampant. Finding the answer became first the job and then the obsession of Stuart W. Bowen Jr., a friend from Texas of President George W. Bush who in 2004 was appointed to serve as a special inspector general to investigate corruption and waste in Iraq. Before his office was finally shut down last year, Mr. Bowen believed he might have succeeded \u2014 but only partly \u2014 in that mission.Much of the money was probably used by the Iraqi government in some way, he concluded. But for years Mr. Bowen could not account for billions more until his investigators finally had a breakthrough, discovering that $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion had been stolen and moved to a bunker in rural Lebanon for safe keeping. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the money got to Lebanon,\u201d Mr. Bowen said. \u201cIf I knew that, we would have made more progress on the case.\u201d Mr. Bowen kept the discovery and his investigation of the cash-filled bunker in Lebanon, which his office code-named Brick Tracker, secret. He has never publicly discussed it until now, and his frustration that neither he nor his investigators can fully account for the missing money was evident in a series of interviews. \u201cBillions of dollars have been taken out of Iraq over the last 10 years illegally,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this investigation, we thought we were on the track for some of that lost money. It\u2019s disappointing to me personally that we were unable to close this case, for reasons beyond our control.\u201dHe is equally frustrated that the Bush administration, apart from his office, never investigated reports that huge amounts of money had disappeared, and that after his investigators found out about the bunker, the Obama administration did not pursue that lead, either. Mr. Bowen said his investigators briefed the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. on what they found. But Mr. Bowen added that he believed one reason American officials had not gone after it was \u201cbecause it was Iraqi money stolen by Iraqis.\u201dSpokesmen for the F.B.I. and C.I.A. declined to comment for this article.The Iraqi government has also not tried to retrieve the money, and has kept information about the Lebanese bunker secret. Mr. Bowen said that he talked to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki about the missing money and his discovery of the bunker and that Mr. Maliki never took any action, while expressing anger at the way the United States had handled the airlifted cash.The money so assiduously carried to Iraq from a vast facility in New Jersey operated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York came from the Development Fund of Iraq, which was created by a United Nations resolution in May 2003 to hold Iraqi oil revenue. The fund was to be used in Iraq\u2019s reconstruction, and the United Nations resolution called for the creation of a monitoring board to make sure the United States-led Coalition Provisional Authority, which governed Iraq in 2003 and the first half of 2004 and ordered the cash flights, used the money properly for the benefit of the Iraqi people. For the C.P.A., an advantage of using the cash from the Development Fund instead of money appropriated by Congress for Iraq was that there were not a lot of rules governing its use, and no federal regulations or congressional oversight of what happened to it. It was Iraqi money, not anything from American taxpayers. In an interview, Paul Bremer, who was the head of the C.P.A., defended the agency\u2019s handling of the funds, and said the money was badly needed to keep Iraqi government ministries in operation. In particular, he defended the decision to accelerate the cash flights in June 2004, just before the provisional authority closed and was replaced by an interim Iraqi government. In the last two weeks of June, the C.P.A. ordered $4 billion to $5 billion in cash to be flown to Baghdad from New York in a rapid-fire series of last-minute flights. The Iraqi government \u201cwas broke at that point,\u201d Mr. Bremer said. \u201cCivil servants had not been paid for about three months. We had to get funds there right away.\u201d He said that there was a budget process in Baghdad that determined how much cash was requested from the Federal Reserve.\u201cThe issue is what happened to the money once it was distributed through the minister of finance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a very clear record of funds going to the Iraqi system.\u201dMr. Bowen was dismissive of Mr. Bremer\u2019s defense of the C.P.A. Accounting for the funds was so lax, he said, that there were few credible records of how it was spent. \u201cOur auditors interviewed numerous senior advisers of the C.P.A., and we learned from them that the controls on the Development Fund of Iraq money were inadequate,\u201d Mr. Bowen said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make this up; we learned this from C.P.A. staff.\u201dFormer Treasury Department officials also questioned the need for the flights. Treasury had already sent $1.7 billion in cash from Iraqi government accounts in the United States to Baghdad in the first weeks after the invasion, and then had developed a new Iraqi currency that was introduced that October. They say the new currency ended the need for further cash infusions from the United States. \u201cWe did not know that Bremer was flying in all that cash,\u201d said Ged Smith, who was the head of the Treasury Department team that worked on Iraq\u2019s financial reconstruction after the invasion. \u201cI can\u2019t see a reason for it.\u201d Mr. Bowen said that Brick Tracker, his office\u2019s most sensitive investigation, began in 2010 when Wael el-Zein, a Lebanese- American on his staff, received a tip about stolen money hidden in Lebanon. An informant told him about the bunker, which in addition to the cash, was believed to also have held approximately $200 million in gold belonging to the Iraqi government. But by this time, official Washington had long since forgotten about the flights from Andrews. The C.I.A. expressed little interest in pursuing the matter, and the F.B.I. said it lacked jurisdiction, Mr. Bowen recalled. And when Mr. Bowen and his staff tried to conduct an investigation of the missing cash in Lebanon, they also met with resistance from the United States Embassy in Beirut. Mr. Bowen was not allowed to travel to Lebanon on official business. Two of his investigators who did travel to Lebanon were denied permission from the embassy to see the bunker themselves because it was too dangerous. When Mr. Bowen\u2019s staff members met in Beirut with Lebanon\u2019s prosecutor general, Said Mirza, he initially agreed to cooperate on an investigation, but later decided against it. The office of the special inspector general for Iraq closed in 2013, and Mr. Bowen is now working in the private sector. Mr. Bowen thinks at least some of the money has been moved, and said it is impossible to say whether any of it is still in the bunker. He says he is still frustrated by the lack of cooperation he got from his own government in his efforts to pursue the missing cash. \u201cWe struggled to gain timely support from the interagency as we pursued this case,\u201d Mr. Bowen said.This article is adapted from \u201cPay Any Price: Greed, Power and Endless War\u201d by James Risen, to be published Tuesday by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Union Officials Urge Nations to Submit Draft Budgets", "Date": "2014-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUXEMBOURG \u2014 European Union authorities on Wednesday warned eurozone countries like France and Italy to hand in their draft budgets by the end of the day under rules aimed at staving off future financial crises.Since the revelation of a huge hole in Greek finances five years ago set off a devastating debt crisis, member states of the currency bloc must submit draft budgets to the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, by mid-October.By early Wednesday evening, Austria, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain had handed in their budgets. But countries including France and Italy \u2014 where concerns about the economy are greatest \u2014 still had not.\u201cThose documents need to be sent to us by today,\u201d Simon O\u2019Connor, a spokesman for the European Commission, said at a news conference.\u201cThere are no sanctions\u201d for missing the deadline, but \u201cwe don\u2019t expect countries not to comply with this requirement,\u201d he said.He emphasized that the tougher rules for reviewing budgets had been approved by the member states themselves.This year, the requirement to submit a draft budget applies to 16 of the 18 countries using the single currency. Greece and Cyprus are exempt because they are already under close scrutiny as part of their international bailout programs.If the commission decides that France or Italy should make changes to bring their deficits or debt in line with European Union rules, then it must make that request within two weeks of receiving the documents, or by the end of October, assuming that France and Italy make the Wednesday deadline.The eurozone economy is again a source of global concern since France, the currency union\u2019s second-largest economy after Germany, has failed to grow as hoped; Italy is still trying to reduce its enormous debt; and Germany, the bloc\u2019s economic engine, is at risk of stalling.\u201cThe government is reneging on its past commitments with a bewildering lack of compunction,\u201d Bruno Cavalier, the chief economist for Oddo Securities, wrote in a client note on Wednesday. Mr. Cavalier branded the country \u201ca serial fiscal delinquent.\u201dThe French stance has rattled European Union officials intent on ensuring that the fiscal rule book calling for budget deficits of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product is respected. The 2015 budget, as recently announced by the French government, would have a deficit of more than 4 percent next year, and France would not meet the 3 percent target before 2017.European Union officials fear a repeat of what happened in the middle of the last decade when large countries like Germany flouted rules meant to ensure that disparate economies can operate on a single currency by having all governments adhere to basic debt and deficit guidelines.The recent declarations by the French government were cause for \u201csome worry,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the group of eurozone finance ministers, told reporters this week at a ministerial meeting in Luxembourg.Yet there is little appetite for a prolonged showdown with France that would force it to swallow more austerity and that could make the already unpopular government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande even weaker while strengthening the appeal of the far-right National Front, led by Marine Le Pen.Obliging France to make further cuts also could hurt the economies of its big trading partners, like Germany.This week, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister known for his hard line on fiscal issues, told reporters at the gathering in Luxembourg that it was important to await the details of the French plan. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble also said he was \u201cconfident that a solution can be found in the case of France.\u201dIf the commission remains unhappy with the French budget, Jyrki Katainen, the commissioner for economic and monetary policy, would have two weeks to ask Paris to submit a new one.If that happened and France failed to make an improved offer, Mr. Katainen could recommend that member states impose a fine of up to 0.2 percent of its G.D.P., in theory as soon as November.But France would still have plenty of room to avoid a fine by making a case that a weak economy, including the threat of deflation, is creating exceptional challenges, and by moving ahead with promised economic overhauls.Another way out of the impasse might be a bargain in which the German government would pledge to spend more to revitalize demand in the eurozone and more widely, while France would do some additional, painful belt-tightening.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pay Disparities Today", "Date": "2014-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySunday DialogueReaders debate whether workers typically are concerned about their own pay but not that of top executives.\u00a0To the Editor: My firm has surveyed about 8.6 million workers over five decades, and with one important exception workers almost never mention comparison with their executives\u2019 compensation as a reason for discontent with their own pay.They just don\u2019t care except when the company is doing poorly, the problem is seen to be the result of executives\u2019 incompetence or chicanery, and the workers are suffering (such as layoffs, elimination of salary increases and reductions in benefits), but senior executives are still raking it in. That is indeed galling to employees.But few if any complaints are heard among American workers about the stratospheric incomes of people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates or Michael R. Bloomberg. After all, \u201cthey built their companies\u201d and have created tens of thousands of jobs; it would be almost un-American to resent those achievements or the compensation that goes along with them.The focus on income inequality by politicians and intellectuals is therefore largely off the mark when it comes to workers. Workers are interested in their own financial condition and not that of top executives unless it can be shown that the two are related \u2014 that workers will be significantly better off if executives earn less (or are taxed more). We think that in America that\u2019s a hard sell.The writer is chairman emeritus of Sirota Survey Intelligence and senior author of \u201cThe Enthusiastic Employee: How Companies Profit by Giving Workers What They Want.\u201d\u00a0Readers ReactDavid Sirota\u2019s central claim \u2014 that workers don\u2019t care about their own company\u2019s executive compensation \u2014 is irrelevant to the larger question of societal inequality. It would be so even if one granted the claim. We should, however, question the claim. The answers would probably be quite different if workers were asked: \u201cAre you aware that your company\u2019s executives now earn 300 times the median pay for your fellow workers, whereas 40 years ago, it was only 30 times median pay?\u201dFurther, there remains the question of worker awareness. Do workers connect their diminished prospects for a middle-class life to the actions (including executive pay) of their own chief executives? That workers might be blind to this reality does not, in any way, lesson the burden of inequality.The writer is a retired adjunct professor of economics and finance at Stevens Institute of Technology. \u00a0Mr. Sirota believes that it is a hard sell in America to show \u201cthat workers will be significantly better off if executives earn less (or are taxed more).\u201d But economic history can make a good case. In the last century we have had two periods of high inequality and low taxes on executives \u2014 the years leading up to 1929 and 2008. Both ended in economic disaster.We have also had a long period of low inequality and high taxes on executives \u2014 1946 to 1973. This period is known as the Great Prosperity. For example, real median household income surged 74 percent. Of course there were other factors behind the Great Prosperity \u2014 strong unions, persistent deficit spending and regulation of speculation \u2014 but low inequality and high marginal rates played an important role.\u00a0In my view, no issue is more of a distractive red herring than how much executives are paid. They have generally always been paid well, perhaps too well, for the so-called results they claim to achieve. The real issue is whether pay scales are sufficiently high for others. Companies can readily profit less and still be sufficiently profitable while paying their workers livable wages. Without a middle class made hopeful by the prospect of earning of a livable wage, we create a society that will slowly self-destruct as the gap between the haves and have-nots increases. Let\u2019s forget about overpaid C.E.O.\u2019s; it is the others who deserve our attention.\u00a0\u00a0The roots of employee attitudes about compensation fairness don\u2019t just start once they enter the world of work. My over 30 years working in elementary schools taught me that young children play the \u201cWha-ja-get\u201d game early in their schooling, making comparisons between their test grades or report card grades and the grades of their peers.That might explain why employees don\u2019t typically look at higher-level officials when considering the fairness of their pay. The peer comparisons continue because habits ingrained early in life are enduring. Unless, as Mr. Sirota noted, some grossly unfair compensation practices are occurring that give workers a raw deal, one should not expect a strong connection between employee dissatisfaction and income inequality. But that doesn\u2019t mean that intellectuals and politicians are off the mark.\u00a0Workers would care about the enormous gulf between their pay and executive salaries were they given an accurate picture of the disparity. But it\u2019s been a useful strategy by politicians, business leaders and the corporate media to obscure these numbers, or to smear those illuminating them as \u201cjealous.\u201d For more than three decades we\u2019ve been living under the fiction that funneling the majority of gains and opportunities upward to a small percentage of Americans will somehow, someday magically trickle down to benefit the rest of us. Americans celebrate success. They do not celebrate rigging the game so a tiny percentage can reap all the benefits at their expense.\u00a0Mr. Sirota says most workers believe that executives deserve the pay they receive, pointing to Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg. But these examples are entirely inapposite. Those three are entrepreneurs who built global companies from nothing. The complaint about executive pay is lodged against C.E.O.\u2019s who come to companies that have been thriving for a generation and then claim sole credit for their continued success.When a company\u2019s stock rises, the board of directors attributes the gains to the C.E.O. and uses them to justify an increase in pay. When the stock falls, the C.E.O. is often fired. Both reactions are wrong.Empirical studies have demonstrated repeatedly that very little of a company\u2019s stock price movement is due to the C.E.O.\u2019s actions; most of the variance stems from broader economic trends and industry-specific factors. It is time to stop lionizing (and demonizing) C.E.O.\u2019s for results that are largely beyond their control.The writer is a professor at Southwestern Law School and the author of \u201cIndispensable and Other Myths: Why the C.E.O. Pay Experiment Failed and How to Fix It.\u201d \u00a0The Writer RespondsThe most frequent themes in the letters are that our growing income inequality is unjust and is dysfunctional for the economy, that workers don\u2019t know this, and that they would be much less content with their compensation if they did. In other words, \u201cIf only they knew.\u201d If only they knew, as Ms. Sizer says, that C.E.O.-to-worker compensation in 2013 was an \u201coutrageous\u201d 295.9 to 1. (The ratio was about 40 to 1 in 1980.)While we have never asked a direct question about executive compensation, as Mr. Stoeckert suggests we do, it is clear from our studies that workers\u2019 interest in their pay causes them to be very knowledgeable indeed about it, such as how much workers in other companies are paid for similar work and, in times of high inflation, how the inflation rate compares to their own pay increases. But top management\u2019s pay rarely comes up, either negatively or positively.For those wondering whether workers on our surveys fear making negative comments about senior management, be assured that on many matters \u2014 such as executive competence and leadership \u2014 their comments are often scathing.Mr. Peskoe\u2019s letter is right on the mark when he says that the emphasis on executives\u2019 salary is a \u201cdistractive red herring.\u201d He asks for a focus instead on the actual pay scales of workers and the measures that will increase those, especially at the lowest levels. That is far from an easy task but will fall on much more receptive ears than attacks on the high pay of executives. It\u2019s not too different from Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s concentrating on getting universal prekindergarten education going in New York City and effectively abandoning his proposal that the very rich must pay for it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pentagon Signals Security Risks of Climate Change ", "Date": "2014-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon on Monday released a report asserting decisively that climate change poses an immediate threat to national security, with increased risks from terrorism, infectious disease, global poverty and food shortages. It also predicted rising demand for military disaster responses as extreme weather creates more global humanitarian crises.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, speaking Monday at a meeting of defense ministers in Peru, highlighted the report\u2019s findings and the global security threats of climate change.\u201cThe loss of glaciers will strain water supplies in several areas of our hemisphere,\u201d Mr. Hagel said. \u201cDestruction and devastation from hurricanes can sow the seeds for instability. Droughts and crop failures can leave millions of people without any lifeline, and trigger waves of mass migration.\u201dThe report is the latest in a series of studies highlighting the national security risks of climate change. But the Pentagon\u2019s characterization of it as a present-day threat demanding immediate action represents a significant shift for the military, which has in the past focused on climate change as a future risk.Before, the Pentagon\u2019s response to climate change focused chiefly on preparing military installations to adapt to its effects, like protecting coastal naval bases from rising sea levels. The new report, however, calls on the military to incorporate climate change into broader strategic thinking about high-risk regions \u2014 for example, the ways in which drought and food shortages might set off political unrest in the Middle East and Africa.Experts said that the broadened approach would include considering the role that climate change might have played in contributing to the rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State.\u201cClimate change and water shortages may have triggered the drought that caused farmers to relocate to Syrian cities and triggered situations where youth were more susceptible to joining extremist groups,\u201d said Marcus D. King, an expert on climate change and international affairs at George Washington University. The Islamic State, often referred to as ISIS, has seized scarce water resources to enhance its power and influence.As the Pentagon plans for the impact of climate change, it is conducting a survey to assess the vulnerability of its more than 7,000 bases, installations and other facilities. In places like the Hampton Roads region in Virginia, where there is the largest concentration of American military sites, rapidly rising sea levels have led to repeated flooding.The new report does not make any specific budget recommendations for how the military will pay for its climate change agenda, but if the Pentagon does request funding from Congress for its initiatives, it will clash with congressional Republicans, many of whom question the established scientific evidence that human activities are causing climate change.The Pentagon\u2019s increased emphasis on the national security threats of climate change is aimed in part at building support for a United Nations agreement, to be signed next year in Paris, that would require the world\u2019s largest producers of planet-warming carbon pollution to slash their emissions.Climate change negotiators from around the world will meet in Peru in December to draft that deal. Mr. Hagel\u2019s speech on Monday appeared intended to build support for that effort.\u201cIn two months, the United Nations will convene countries from around the world here in Peru to discuss climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cDefense leaders must be part of this global discussion. We must be cleareyed about the security threats presented by climate change, and we must be proactive in addressing them.\u201dExperts say that Mr. Hagel\u2019s increasingly prominent role in pushing for a new global climate change treaty is a sign that the urgency of the issue is starting to drive changes in the political debate.Today, Mr. Hagel\u2019s efforts to lay the groundwork for a new global climate deal signal a remarkable shift. \u201cIt\u2019s significant that the secretary is focusing his remarks at the defense ministers\u2019 meeting of the Americas on natural disasters and climate change,\u201d said Sherri W. Goodman, senior vice president at the CNA Corporation. \u201cHis making it a priority among the many other things he has to address \u2014 ISIS, Ebola, Russia \u2014 is a signal that the administration intends to place a priority on this in international climate change negotiations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hong Kong Leader Refuses to Resign, but Deputy to Meet With Protesters", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA student protester pleaded for a peaceful resolution. The protesters faced a dilemma Thursday in the face of a government strategy to wait them out, as they considered whether to escalate their confrontation with the authorities by storming a government building or to begin searching for an exit strategy.HONG KONG \u2014 As demonstrators massed outside his offices on Thursday night, Hong Kong\u2019s embattled chief executive rejected demands that he resign and tried to ease public anger by assigning his deputy to meet with student protesters to discuss their calls for democratic reform.But the chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, who was anointed by Beijing to lead Hong Kong two years ago, said the talks would have to be in accordance with an earlier ruling by the Chinese leadership limiting the scope of political change here \u2014 a ruling that has been a target of the mass protests that have shaken this former British colony for nearly a week.\u201cI will not resign because I have to continue my work on universal suffrage,\u201d Mr. Leung said, referring to a proposal to allow residents of Hong Kong to elect his successor in 2017 from among a limited number of candidates approved by Beijing. He also defended the police\u2019s handling of the protests, which included an attempt to disperse crowds using pepper spray and tear gas that infuriated residents.Hours later, one of the two main student groups behind the demonstrations, the Hong Kong Federation of Students, issued a statement agreeing to meet with Mr. Leung\u2019s deputy, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, but called for the talks to be held in public. It added that the protesters\u2019 \u201coccupation\u201d of key parts of Hong Kong would continue, and that the outcome of the talks would determine whether they adopted more aggressive tactics.Another protest group, Occupy Central, also welcomed the offer of talks but repeated demands that Mr. Leung step down and Beijing withdraw its ruling limiting political change.Mr. Leung\u2019s remarks, made at a late-night news conference, were greeted with skepticism by some of the protesters camped outside his offices.\u201cWe think he\u2019s playing for time to see which side can outlast the other,\u201d said Tiffany Ko, a student at the Hong Kong Institute of Education. \u201cThe dialogue will not be a real dialogue \u2014 that\u2019s clear already,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s just going around in circles.\u201dSeveral students took exception to Mr. Leung\u2019s comment that the police had exercised maximum restraint. \u201cWe were just being peaceful, so why say we must be tolerated?\u201d said one, Yan Chen-man. \u201cThat shows his thinking.\u201dEarlier in the day, the police carried containers of rubber bullets, tear gas and other riot control gear into the complex where Mr. Leung\u2019s offices are, and organizers called on protesters to converge on the buildings, warning that the authorities could be preparing to clear the area to allow the government to reopen on Friday after a two-day holiday.Tensions climbed as the crowd swelled. Some student leaders have called on protesters to surround and occupy government buildings if Mr. Leung does not step down. But the police warned that any attempt to do so would not be tolerated.Several protesters said that while they would not storm the buildings, they intended to prevent Mr. Leung from entering his office on Friday morning. That set up a potential showdown with the government, which said that it had a \u201cresponsibility to protect these government offices so they can resume normal operation,\u201d but stopped short of saying whether the police would try to drive the protesters away.A Hong Kong official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the subject, said the government was concerned about access to buildings, especially Police Headquarters, and wanted to warn the students not to defy police officers but could not do so easily because of limited communications.Prospects for reaching a compromise in the government\u2019s talks with the students appeared limited. Mrs. Lam met in the evening with four pro-democracy lawmakers, and no progress was reported.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a leader,\u201d said Irene Ng, an English major at Hong Kong Baptist University. \u201cThis is trying to be a democracy, but then you try to reach a decision and you can\u2019t. Nobody can decide. The ultimate problem is it might split us apart.\u201dThe protesters interviewed gave no indication that a retreat was imminent. But many wondered how long they could sustain the turnout necessary to block crucial roads in the city and just what would constitute an acceptable victory.Tim Lam, an engineer who said he had joined the sit-ins every day since Sunday, said he expected the occupation to last another week at most. \u201cThat\u2019s about how long the protesters\u2019 passion can last,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter one, two weeks of occupation, protesters would start to think about how it affects the economy, the everyday lives of people.\u201dFurther escalation by the protesters could alienate members of the public resentful of a demonstration that affects their daily lives. But without more aggressive steps, the protests could fade. \u201cIf we take rash actions, we may lose people\u2019s sympathy,\u201d said Niko Cheng, a recent college graduate and protester in Mong Kok, a densely populated area of Hong Kong on the Kowloon Peninsula. \u201cBut if this drags on \u2014 it\u2019s already turning into a carnival, with people dancing, singing and all that \u2014 people may forget what they\u2019re here for.\u201dProminent voices in the pro-democracy campaign have indicated that there is no consensus on what, short of an unlikely reversal of the central government\u2019s position, would lead to an end of the protests.\u201cWe have to achieve something that will enable the crowd to claim victory,\u201d said Albert Ho, a lawmaker. \u201cThey must retreat with dignity, but that may not necessarily be complete victory. There must be a sense of achievement.\u201dBut many in Hong Kong shrugged off the commentary and said they would continue pressing for genuine elections. \u201cAll the protesters here and Hong Kong people know it is extremely unlikely the Chinese leaders will respond to our demands,\u201d said Joseph Cheng Yu-shek, a political-science professor at the City University of Hong Kong and a longtime advocate of fuller democracy in the city. \u201cWe are here to say we are not going to give up, we will continue to fight on. We are here because as long as we fight on, at least we haven\u2019t lost.\u201dChris Buckley and Alan Wong contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Working Nation", "Date": "2014-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring the Cold War era, Western economies delivered broad and growing prosperity for the middle class. This nurtured a general faith in political institutions and culminated in the democratic triumphalism of the 1990s.A tree known by its fruit, democratic capitalism, Galston observes, has not produced the expected crop. This has led to a loss of confidence in the regime. Galston\u2019s essay is about how economic problems degrade the national spirit and lead to a loss of faith in the whole enterprise.I think the malaise can be pinned down more precisely. In our meritocratic culture, satisfying and stretching work has become a psychological necessity. More than ever before, we are defined by what we do. If you are of prime age and you are not in the labor force, or engaged in some deeply stretching activity like parenting, then you will begin to feel drained inside. If you are in a dysfunctional workplace with bad personal relationships and no clear purpose, a core piece of you will begin to degrade. If you are not earning enough money so you can feel respected, and live without desperate stress, you will begin to lose confidence and \u00e9lan.And that is what\u2019s happening today. The labor force participation rate is at its lowest in decades. Millions are in part-time or low-wage jobs that don\u2019t come close to fulfilling their capacities. Millions more are in dysfunctional or unhealthy workplaces, but they don\u2019t feel they can leave because they don\u2019t think there are other jobs out there that pay the same amount.The country is palpably in the middle of some sort of emotional recession. Yet over the past five years, the political class has done essentially nothing. That will fill future generations with astonishment and should fill the current generation with rage.It is precisely at this moment that leaders are called upon leap past the current moment and to point the way to the sun-drenched path ahead. You may disagree with every policy they ever uttered, but Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher leapt beyond the stagnant mood of the late 1970s.If you get outside the partisan boxes, there\u2019s a completely obvious agenda to create more middle-class, satisfying jobs. The federal government should borrow money at current interest rates to build infrastructure, including better bus networks so workers can get to distant jobs. The fact that the federal government has not passed major infrastructure legislation is mind-boggling, considering how much support there is from both parties.Other shifts are more fundamental, but should be the signature themes of the next political era. First, the government should reduce its generosity to people who are not working but increase its support for people who are. That means reducing health benefits for the affluent elderly. But it means, as Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute recommends, increasing wage subsidies when employers hire the long-term unemployed and issuing relocation subsidies so people in high unemployment areas can move.Second, the tax code could do a lot more to encourage work and investment. Ideally, we\u2019d move to a progressive consumption tax. But at least we could have the sort of tax reform that Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee have suggested, which would simplify the code while subsidizing middle-class families. The fact that Washington hasn\u2019t even made a run at serious tax reform is another sign of utter political malpractice.Third, the immigration system should turn into a talent recruiting system, a relentless effort to get the world\u2019s most gifted and driven people to move to our shores.Fourth, there has to be a doubling-down on human capital, from early-education programs to community colleges and beyond. Today, too many people are focused on the top 1 percent. As the economist David Autor has noted, if you took all the gains in share of income of the top 1 percent from1979 and 2012 and spread it among the bottom 99 percent, each household would see an increase of $7,000. But if you take a two-earner, high-school-educated couple and get them college degrees, their income goes up by $58,000 per year. Inequality is mostly a human capital problem.This isn\u2019t rocket science. Vast majorities support every idea I\u2019ve mentioned here. It just takes a relentless focus on job creation, bold political leadership and a country willing to be shaken out of its fear.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Birthplace of the Arab Spring, Discontent Opens a Door to the Past", "Date": "2014-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From TunisiaTUNIS \u2014 Chaima Issa, a poet and the daughter of a former political prisoner, is determined to keep Tunisia\u2019s revolution alive.She is running as a candidate for a small democratic party in parliamentary elections next weekend in one of the most populous constituencies of the capital. A 34-year-old who wears purple-frame glasses, a tight white T-shirt and jeans, she is an outsider but a passionate one as she crisscrosses the old quarter of Tunis reaching out to voters.Almost four years after a popular uprising that overthrew President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and set off the Arab Spring in 2011, Tunisians are grappling with price increases, unemployment and rising terrorism \u2014 and roundly blame their politicians for the mess. The frustration is such that people often say they wish for a return of the Ben Ali era.Tunisia has been torn by ideological divisions between Islamists who won the first elections after the revolution in 2011 and secularists who led a protest movement against the Islamist government last year after the assassination of two members of Parliament. Now riding on the wave of discontent, former officials from the Ben Ali government, who are free to run for office for the first time since the uprising, are attempting a comeback. It is a prospect that incenses Ms. Issa.\u201cIt is horrible, shameful,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are profiting from our revolution; they are picking our flowers. It is they who spilled our blood.\u201dIn the capital\u2019s old city recently, Ms. Issa found voters in an angry mood and vowing not to vote at all for the politicians, whom they clearly distrust. \u201cAll they want is a position, and then they never let go!\u201d shouted one market worker striding past a group of workers from Ms. Issa\u2019s National Democratic Alliance party who were wearing white party T-shirts and handing out leaflets and waving flags. \u201cLong live Ben Ali!\u201d shouted a vendor when he saw her party flags.Tunisians will elect a new Parliament on Sunday, and then a month later vote for a new president, with a possible presidential runoff on Dec. 28. The elections will end a transitional period that has seen four interim governments since 2011.Among those fielding candidates are seven or eight parties formed by officials of Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s government and four former ministers who are contesting the presidential election. Barred from running for office in the 2011 elections for a constituent assembly, those former officials have been allowed to take part in the 2014 parliamentary and presidential elections after a vote to exclude them was narrowly defeated in the National Constituent Assembly last year.Many of the smaller democratic parties feel threatened by the return of members of the former government and in particular associates of Mr. Ben Ali from the former governing party, the R.C.D., who they say have retained their business and political connections and command substantial wealth.The main Islamist party, Ennahda, voted to allow the return of former officials despite internal opposition, calculating that to include them in politics would reduce the antagonism that has been aimed against their party. Rather than exclude them, let the electorate decide, said Rachid Ghannouchi, Ennahda\u2019s leader.Some of the former officials have been feted on their return. An effusive crowd greeted Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s former health minister, Mondher Zenaidi, when he flew back to Tunis from self-exile in France last month. Party workers were hanging red bunting outside the newly painted campaign headquarters of the Destourian Movement on Saturday as former officials clustered around their presidential candidate, Abderrahim Zouari, 70, a stalwart of the Ben Ali government who was released from prison last year, acquitted of corruption charges.A larger number of former officials have also joined Nidaa Tounes, a party led by the 87-year-old statesman Beji Caid Essebsi, who served as a senior official under both of Tunisia\u2019s authoritarian leaders but who was nevertheless considered acceptable enough to serve as interim prime minister in 2011. Mr. Essebsi helped lead the backlash against the Islamists last year and is now the front-runner for the presidential election. His party is vying with Ennahda to win the most seats in Parliament.Opinions polls show Nida Tounes and Ennahda each garnering roughly a third of national support. Neither is expected to win an outright majority and so under Tunisia\u2019s parliamentary system the party with the most seats will need to find coalition partners to form a government. Many, including Western governments eager to see some stability brought to North Africa, are encouraging the main parties to join together in a government of national unity.The tumult of the last four years has made many Tunisians look back favorably on the certainties of the authoritarian governments of the past, in particular the era of Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia\u2019s first president after independence. People even express support for Mr. Ben Ali and his officials in a surge of nostalgia as they recall the low prices, security and clean streets under his governance.\u201cIf they come back, we will greet them at the airport,\u201d said Fatima Ben Hamem, a mother of five, who was attending a campaign rally for Ennahda in the neighborhood of Ibn Sina in Tunis on Saturday. \u201cThey say Ben Ali stole \u2014 God knows if he did \u2014 but he did not steal from the poor people.\u201d A survey conducted in the spring by the Pew Research Center found that 59 percent of Tunisians supported a leader with a strong hand, up from 37 percent two years ago. Meanwhile, only 38 percent prefer democratic government to solve the nation\u2019s problems, down from 61 percent in the same period.The nostalgia has alarmed some, leading a group of journalists to produce a documentary titled \u201cSeven Lives,\u201d which examines the phenomenon of nostalgia for Mr. Ben Ali \u2014 a mix of psychological insecurity; a typically human desire for routine; and ignorance of the uglier elements of his rule, including the torture and repression, but also something as basic as the economy, the film concludes.Those who have studied other societies in transition \u2014 namely post-communist countries \u2014 say it is to be expected that former officials will make a comeback after several years.\u201cThe second elections always see the return of the old regime,\u201d said Munir Dahfous, campaign manager for the centrist Al-Jamhouri party. Yet he, like many others, predicts that the achievements of the revolution, including freedoms enshrined in a new Constitution, cannot be undone. \u201cWe will see the return of the people, but not the system,\u201d he said.Mr. Zouari, whom many see as the most hard-line of Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s ministers running for office, is intent on reminding citizens that life was better under the former government. The Destourians could form a bloc in Parliament and are receiving overtures from other parties, he said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cWe will be not a majority, but a considerable group,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat is important now is that the machine, the machinery of the R.C.D., was sick and now there is oil in its engine and it is beginning to turn,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have experience, we know the land and the dossier, and we can be operational from tomorrow.\u201dMost political opponents and analysts predict, however, that the Ben Ali officials will make little showing and that voters will reject them at the polls.\u201cThey are not strong,\u201d said Samir Taieb, a legislative candidate of the social democratic party Al-Mossar. \u201cThey are spread across several parties.\u201dYet others warn that their influence is insidious. \u201cThe old regime always worked covertly,\u201d Ahmed Nejib Chebbi, a presidential candidate and veteran dissident, said in an interview. \u201cThere is a risk of a return, a masked return, of the old regime. In effect, there is a threat to the democratic process.\u201dFor Ms. Issa, the poet, it is personal. Her father, a painter, spent eight years in prison while she was a teenager for his support for the Islamist movement, a spell she blames for causing her mother\u2019s premature death.\u201cThey have the machine, they have the people, and money and that is what we fear,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Pot Inc., the Rush to Cash In Is Underway", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than a year before the first legal dose of marijuana will be dispensed in New York, a group of entrepreneurs gathered at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square in late October to discuss strategy with an influential state lawmaker. It was the weekly meet-up of the Cannabis and Hemp Association, which formed in May to get a jump on future business.The mood among the 18 people at the table was one of excitement. Oleg Maryasis, 30, a former financial adviser, said he had just met with a group of investors who were eager to sink tens of millions of dollars into the New York cannabis trade.The group\u2019s organizer, Scott Giannotti, a bald, heavyset 35-year-old from Long Island whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes selling cellphones and rapping, and who now sells LED grow lights from China, questioned the meeting\u2019s special guest, State Senator Diane J. Savino. Ms. Savino, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island, was a sponsor of the medical marijuana bill that New York passed last summer, 18 years after it was first proposed; her efforts led Elle magazine to name her one of its \u201c13 most potent women in the pot industry now.\u201d\u201cSenator,\u201d Mr. Giannotti said, \u201cwhat can we do to help you out?\u201dMs. Savino offered some cautionary words. The State Health Department, she said, had not yet written guidelines for the medical marijuana program, and the licenses available for companies keen to participate would be few and costly. And, she added, legalized recreational use, as proposed by State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, was unlikely any time soon.Still, Ms. Savino called the legislation a turning point, for the state and the industry. \u201cWe can probably take in a couple hundred million dollars a year, minimally,\u201d she said, referring to potential tax revenue. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have patients who are acclimated to medical marijuana, doctors who recognize it, communities who realize that if they have a dispensary it\u2019s not the end of the world. Then you\u2019re going to have more demand. In a state this size, the potential is huge.\u201dWhen Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed the Compassionate Care Act in July, it gave the Health Department 18 months to come up with regulations and choose up to five companies to grow and dispense medical marijuana.Now, for the state\u2019s would-be growers, private equity investors, labor unions, lawyers, lobbyists, consultants, branding firms, suits, stoners and hucksters, the rush is on.This is the moment when old-guard legalizers meet a new breed of capitalist.In October, 900 people flocked to a hotel in Midtown Manhattan for a $900-a-head, three-day East Coast Cannabis Business Expo, Educational Conference and Regulatory Summit, the first of its kind in New York. The event\u2019s organizers were two veterans of the tanning salon business; the crowd ranged from venture capitalists to chocolatiers to people currently growing illegally, with a smattering of doctors and representatives of at least one nursing home conglomerate. There were vendors of supply-chain tracking software, security services and malpractice insurance, as well as a manufacturer of precision-grade scales from the diamond district. Not a single bong in the house.\u201cThis is sexy, this is drugs,\u201d one speaker, Adam Bierman, a managing partner of MedMen, a California-based consulting company, told a crowded conference room. \u201cThis is something there\u2019s already demand for. This is selling pot.\u201dUnder New York\u2019s law, licensed companies will grow and sell their own product, from \u201cseed to sale.\u201d Doctors can recommend, but not prescribe, it to treat a limited set of conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis and AIDS. Though federal law still prohibits the sale and possession of marijuana, the Justice Department advised its prosecutors in 2013 that if state laws to legalize the substance properly limited its spread, and if companies complied with state laws, they should not be prosecuted.Because banks and credit-card companies are federally regulated, the purchase and sale of cannabis has so far been a cash business. New York\u2019s health commissioner will set the price of the drug, probably based on the street value.New York\u2019s law is among the most restrictive to be passed by the 23 states that have legalized marijuana use in some form. The 20 dispensaries set to open in a state of nearly 20 million people are likely to be high-volume centers, located away from schools or houses of worship, where patients or caregivers with state identification cards can get up to a month\u2019s supply of non-smokable product.The emerging industry has drawn people from unlikely precincts. Patrick McCarthy, a lobbyist who spent the last three years pushing legalization for cannabis companies, was once an aide to Gov. George E. Pataki and the executive director of the New York Republican State Committee. Dean Petkanas, who plans to seek a state license, was a chief financial officer at Stratton Oakmont, the penny-stock boiler room operation depicted in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d; Mr. Petkanas now runs a \u201cphyto-medical company\u201d called KannaLife Sciences that hopes to get F.D.A. approval of a cannabis-based treatment for two types of brain encephalopathy. At the conference, he wore a pinstripe three-piece suit and spoke in torrents.\u201cI did a lot of pharmaceutical work on Wall Street when I was in boutique investment banking,\u201d he said, skipping over his time at Stratton Oakmont. \u201cI spent a lot of time in merchant banking. I really dug in hard.\u201d Shares of KannaLife\u2019s parent company, Medical Marijuana Inc., have fallen by more than half since earlier this year.The competition to acquire the five available licenses will be fierce and expensive. Application costs alone could run to several hundred thousand dollars; start-up costs could top $20 million. \u201cI would suggest that anyone who wants to be serious be prepared to spend at least a million dollars\u201d on an application, said Evan Nison, 24, a lobbyist and consultant for cannabis companies and a founder of the New York Cannabis Alliance, which advocates changing the state\u2019s marijuana laws. Richard N. Gottfried, a Democratic state assemblyman from Manhattan who led the long fight to legalize medical marijuana, cited an unwritten formula of government regulation. \u201cWhen you make a statute very restrictive \u2014 and the governor did that in the last hours \u2014 you raise the stakes and create a need for more lawyers and consultants,\u201d he said.Out-of-state firms able to show they have run successful cannabis operations elsewhere will have an edge in the licensing process. But any hope for quick profits will be limited by the small number of conditions for which New York is allowing the drug\u2019s use.Still, the arrival of medical marijuana opens the door to a potentially huge market, said Derek Peterson, 40, a former senior vice president at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Mr. Peterson now heads Terra Tech, a publicly traded company that already operates a five-acre hydroponic growing facility in New Jersey turning out basil, kale and other produce while awaiting the opening of more local dispensaries, which Gov. Chris Christie opposes.\u201cWe don\u2019t love the way the New York policy works, but over time the legislation can change,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cEven if you can\u2019t make a significant profit now, you can invest in it for the future.\u201d He compared New York to Nevada, where Terra Tech had already spent \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d to apply for a license and hired Senator Harry Reid\u2019s son Rory as a lobbyist. The cost of applying in New York, he said, might run in the high six figures. Cannabis industry cash has begun to flow into New York. Ms. Savino said her campaign donations from out-of-state growers were \u201caround $10,000 or $15,000 \u2014 not much.\u201dThe amount of money at stake has attracted investors from across the spectrum; from Wall Street to High Times magazine, the 40-year-old counterculture survivor that earlier this year announced that it planned to create a private equity High Times Growth Fund to invest in the cannabis businesses.Unions have also claimed a share. In New York, all licensees will be union shops, a result of two years of lobbying by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which has also been successful in other states. Cannabis is a rare growth sector for organized labor. \u201cWe saw around the country that these jobs had the potential to be real middle-class jobs if the workers were organized,\u201d said Ed Draves, a lobbyist with Bolton St. Johns who led the push for the union. \u201cHere in New York, you saw the home health care industry develop, where a lot of the workers were health care workers who couldn\u2019t attain health care or pension benefits. We didn\u2019t want to see that as we developed this industry.\u201dFor investors, the business strikes a familiar chord, with the potential for huge growth and high risk. \u201cThere are a lot of parallels that I draw to what happened in the technology space in the late \u201990s and early 2000s,\u201d said Al Foreman, a former managing director of J.P. Morgan\u2019s growth equity fund Highbridge Principal Strategies. Since leaving Wall Street last December, Mr. Foreman helped start a private equity group called Tuatara Capital that plans to invest in cannabis industries across the Americas. \u201cFor lack of another term,\u201d Mr. Foreman said, \u201cit\u2019s a new frontier.\u201dTuatara has not yet started raising money, and Mr. Foreman declined to say how much it hopes to amass. But he said there was already interest among investors. And, he added, the nascent cannabis industry is ahead of where the technology sector was 20 years ago.Because people have been buying marijuana for years, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a more easily identifiable consumer base than what you might have seen in the early days of the Internet, when people were still trying to figure out how to get paying customers. We\u2019re talking about an industry with real assets and markets where there is existing demand.\u201dMr. Foreman noted that the cultural gap between Wall Street and the purveyors of products like Ghost Train Haze and Holy Grail Kush is not what it once was. Money changes everything. \u201cWhen I took a trip to Denver to walk the halls and the plants and the factories, you realize that these are not kids in the basement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stereotype is shattered by the level of professionalism. Some of these companies will grow into really large companies.\u201dHigh Times hopes to grow with them, said Michael Kennedy, its controlling owner. Mr. Kennedy, a criminal lawyer who at the magazine\u2019s inception represented its founder in an investigation into smuggling charges, said High Times was close to launching its private equity fund with two partners \u2014 so close that he would not discuss previously disclosed details for fear of violating government rules against soliciting business ahead of a launch. An interview with Mr. Kennedy published by Bloomberg Businessweek in June cited a target of $300 million for the fund.On a recent day, Malcolm MacKinnon, the magazine\u2019s silver-haired editor, presided over a staff of more than two dozen, with ages ranging from their 20s to their 60s, as they worked quietly on the February issue (the cover story: a showdown between cannabis sativa and cannabis indica). Professionally, Mr. MacKinnon uses the pseudonym Dan Skye, an artifact from less cannabis-friendly times, when he was raising children and coaching Little League.With its run-of-the-mill cubicles, the office felt more like the law firm that shares space with the magazine than the partying High Times suggested by its pages. Asked whether the staff smoked in the office, Mr. MacKinnon replied with a note of sarcasm, \u201cGee, we wouldn\u2019t do that because it\u2019s illegal.\u201dThe private equity fund continues the magazine\u2019s efforts to merge with the mainstream. These days, High Times organizes a sprawling trade show and smoke-off called the Cannabis Cup. Once limited to a single annual event in Amsterdam, where competitors vied to provide the most potent herb, the Cannabis Cup is now a domestic affair that draws tens of thousands of attendees to multiple locations. Versions were held in five cities in the United States this year, with speakers and vendors of everything a contemporary cannabis consumer might fancy, except, in some places, cannabis.High Times is now a legacy business, with four decades of experience in a field many are just entering, Mr. MacKinnon said.\u201cEverybody wants to talk to us now.\u201dThat group may include people like Ari Hoffnung, 40, who hopes to get one of the New York licenses. He named his fledgling company Fiorello Pharmaceuticals Inc., in tribute to New York mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, who opposed the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, when the substance was still legal. For now, Mr. Hoffnung has formed an investor group, while seeking to forge partnerships with companies that have grown and dispensed marijuana in other states.Mr. Hoffnung is a former managing director at Bear Stearns, and was a deputy comptroller when John C. Liu served as the city comptroller. He said he became interested in medical marijuana after seeing \u201cfolks in my family with A.L.S. and other conditions where cannabis has been proven helpful to relieve pain and suffering.\u201dBut he had another interest in legal cannabis. While working for Mr. Liu, he took part in a study that asked how many city residents might benefit from the legalization of marijuana, and how much money the city might reap. The numbers were big: 100,000 patients for medical cannabis, and tax revenue of $400 million if recreational use were legalized.The figures, Mr. Hoffnung acknowledged, will not be realized until well into the future, if ever. But the current regulatory conditions, with each state setting its own laws and no distribution across state lines, might be an advantage for smaller companies like his.\u201cNo major companies want to create a business model and have to replicate it in 23 states,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t allow economies of scale.\u201dThat could change, especially as businesses press state and federal legislators harder. In New York, the public is already on board, said Mr. McCarthy, the lobbyist, citing polls that show support for medical marijuana at 83 percent in the state, up from just 58 percent a few years ago. The support, he said, is widespread. \u201cThere\u2019s no drop off from a senior in Buffalo to an independent soccer mom in Suffolk.\u201dIn the meantime, at the Cannabis and Hemp Association meeting, the aspiring moguls had a regulatory request for Ms. Savino. They wanted more regulation, not less. Specifically, Mr. Giannotti worried about over-the-counter remedies being sold as non-psychoactive hemp oil or CBD oil (CBD, or cannabidiol, is one of the active ingredients in cannabis). Such products are largely unregulated and sell for as much as hundreds of dollars for a small amount. The attendees worried that such companies might taint the industry. Could the state crack down on them?Ms. Savino pulled a bottle of something called Green Cures CBD Oil from her purse, eying it skeptically. \u201cPeople believe what they want to believe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to protect people from what they think will help.\u201dMr. Maryasis said he hoped the over-the-counter products, which were plentiful at the recent trade show, were not a sign of things to come, especially before regulated medical marijuana becomes available.\u201cThis sets a bad standard for the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to lead with genuineness, and not just opportunism.\u201dHe added: \u201cIf we do this right, we can be an example to the nation. We don\u2019t have to be the first ones to legalize it. We just have to do it right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Should End the Embargo on Cuba", "Date": "2014-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialScanning a map of the world must give President Obama a sinking feeling as he contemplates the dismal state of troubled bilateral relationships his administration has sought to turn around. He would be smart to take a hard look at Cuba, where a major policy shift could yield a significant foreign policy success.For the first time in more than 50 years, shifting politics in the United States and changing policies in Cuba make it politically feasible to re-establish formal diplomatic relations and dismantle the senseless embargo. The Castro regime has long blamed the embargo for its shortcomings, and has kept ordinary Cubans largely cut off from the world. Mr. Obama should seize this opportunity to end a long era of enmity and help a population that has suffered enormously since Washington ended diplomatic relations in 1961, two years after Fidel Castro assumed power.The pace of reforms has been slow and there has been backsliding. Still, these changes show Cuba is positioning itself for a post-embargo era. The government has said it would welcome renewed diplomatic relations with the United States and would not set preconditions.Starting in 1961, Washington has imposed sanctions in an effort to oust the Castro regime. Over the decades, it became clear to many American policy makers that the embargo was an utter failure. But any proposal to end the embargo angered Cuban-American voters, a constituency that has had an outsize role in national elections.Fully ending the embargo will require Congress\u2019s approval. But there is much more the White House could do on its own. For instance, it could lift caps on remittances, allow Americans to finance private Cuban businesses and expand opportunities for travel to the island.It could also help American companies that are interested in developing the island\u2019s telecommunications network but remain wary of the legal and political risks. Failing to engage with Cuba now will likely cede this market to competitors. The presidents of China and Russia traveled to Cuba in separate visits in July, and both leaders pledged to expand ties.Given the many crises around the world, the White House may want to avoid a major shift in Cuba policy. Yet engaging with Cuba and starting to unlock the potential of its citizens could end up being among the administration\u2019s most consequential foreign-policy legacies.Normalizing relations with Havana would improve Washington\u2019s relationships with governments in Latin America, and resolve an irritant that has stymied initiatives in the hemisphere. The Obama administration is leery of Cuba\u2019s presence at the meeting and Mr. Obama has not committed to attending. He must \u2014 and he should see it as an opportunity to make history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gstaad: The Last Resort", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe wealthy residents of Gstaad, one of Europe\u2019s few remaining bastions of Old World refinement, are waging a war against newly minted billionaires determined to turn the idyllic mountain town into their own gaudy playground. But despite putting up a solid front, the locals are quaking in their fur-lined ski boots.The resort town of Gstaad likes to congratulate itself on its snow-globe-preserved Alpine charms. Here, change moves at a glacial pace. This has proved both boon and bane to this Galt\u2019s Gulch of billionaires, where from the road, every chalet looks pretty much the same, and they talk about Russians the way people used to talk about Jews in Darien, Conn. If locals ever wandered too far off-piste with the big decisions, Gstaad would risk tumbling into the same precipice as, well, St. Moritz, the girl next door who just couldn\u2019t say no and is now coping with noisy nightclubs and condominiums. And Russians. Anyone who lives in Gstaad also toyed with buying in St. Moritz, hence the rivalry between them; when a United Nations study in 2007 revealed St. Moritz\u2019s wastewater contained traces of cocaine, the local magazine GstaadLife immediately proclaimed, \u201cSt. Moritz is the drug capital of the Alps.\u201dIf you are even considering Gstaad as a destination, chances are you don\u2019t need the pronunciation key (that\u2019s Gstaad, with a K). Perhaps you don\u2019t even ski, in which case you are among the estimated 40 percent for whom Gstaad is solely about scene as scenery. And you are obviously not in college, or you\u2019d be leaning toward Verbier or Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. Gstaad is the place for people who have graduated to the big-big bucks \u2014 and their children with commensurate trust funds, many of whom are enrolled at Le Rosey, whose satellite winter campus is here. (The most expensive private school in the world, at about $110,000 a year, famously keeps students motivated by breaking midday for an afternoon schuss.)Twenty years ago, the German art collector Friedrich Christian \u201cMick\u201d Flick picked Gstaad over St. Moritz as his primary residence for the quiet. \u201cSt. Moritz is dramatic. This is soft, charming. The dinners are more private. The chalets, more expensive,\u201d he says in a surprising basso profundo. \u201cGstaad doesn\u2019t really act like the rest of Switzerland. It\u2019s unique, like an independent principality of Gstaad,\u201d explains Cedric Notz, the 40-year-old son of Peter Notz, one of a trio of Euro playboys invariably described as \u201cfounders of the town\u201d \u2014 the other two being Gunter Sachs, who killed himself here in 2011, and Flick, who misses the open house his great friend Peter kept for a decade.A sign banning all manner of casual attire is posted outside the Palace\u2019s revolving door in the evenings. When the hotel\u2019s uncharacteristically young, low-key owner and general manager, Andrea Scherz, spotted new-to-town Harvey Weinstein in the Grill downstairs, tails out, undershirt visible, he initially thought \u201ca waiter had gone crazy and was quitting.\u201d Weinstein was asked to please rethink the outfit in his room upstairs. (Through a spokesperson, Weinstein says the incident didn\u2019t happen.)\u201cWhen I came here after the war with my parents \u2014 and it was like this until the late \u201970s \u2014 every shop on the main street was either a cheese shop or a butcher or a vegetable market,\u201d laments the 78-year-old columnist Taki Theodoracopulos. Gstaad has been to Taki (as he\u2019s known locally and professionally) what the Lake District was to Wordsworth. But recently, he\u2019s considered forsaking Gstaad for Lauenen, the next village over: \u201cIt\u2019s Gstaad in the 1950s. The Russians won\u2019t come there because there are no boutiques.\u201dThere isn\u2019t a resident in Gstaad unaware of Taki\u2019s special contempt for jewelers, Russians (but not Romanoffs), Bernie Ecclestone et filles, Arabs and any nonskier who would presume to snare a balcony table at his own beloved Eagle. Wearing his ski vest with its Eagle Club patch, Taki carries on like he\u2019s the club\u2019s own Scylla and Charybdis. \u201cAnd it drives them crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t get in after spending $50 million on a chalet.\u201dAll around us are Le Rosey alumni visiting their children, parents who often decide to divert millions toward a chalet and stay a while. This is how Gstaad became Gstaad. One table over sits the preternaturally mature Christophe Gudin, 29, who was phased in last year as Le Rosey\u2019s fifth director in 134 years. Gudin is supervising the school\u2019s move to nearby Sch\u00f6nried, where he imagines they will break ground in three years once plans are approved.Three years is nothing around here: On the evening of April 11, 1995, the ramshackle Grand Hotel Alpina went down with a dynamite boom that resounded through the valley in more ways than one. There were ambitious plans for what would be the town\u2019s first big-league hotel built from scratch in a century, and its Swiss developer would not be stopped by an injunction. The Alpina\u2019s wealthy neighbors tied up the project in court for 13 years. The $325-million replacement popped out of the ground in time for Christmas two years ago. Gstaad, unique among Alpine villages, passed laws in the \u201950s banning any departure from the classic three-story Simmentaler style. And the Alpina is no different. But what chalet owners do on the inside and underground is a separate matter, and with the Alpina now sparing no expense for art and a Japanese restaurant, other hotels feel obliged to keep up.Not that anyone expects any of these places to make money. Hotels don\u2019t thrive where the high season consists of all of six weeks (though people are now coming here in August, exhausted after St. Tropez and Ibiza \u2014 but not so exhausted they can\u2019t use a polo field). However good the Alpina and any other newcomers prove at being hotels, they are calculated real-estate plays, more about apartments and chalets for sale elsewhere on the grounds.The epic delay at the Alpina turned out to be a stroke of luck for Marcel Bach, the public face of the project and a persevering man. (After a first failed frostbitten crack at Mount Everest, he bestrode its summit a year later.) Property prices in the area are up, up and away. When the project was completed, Bach had Cristal delivered to the Alpina plaintiffs as a thank you. Gstaad\u2019s first bona fide Russian oligarch, Dmitry Rybolovlev, bought two of the chalets, paying a reported $130 million apiece. This is the same Dmitry Rybolovlev penthoused in New York City\u2019s 15 Central Park West, a fertilizer magnate whom Taki calls the king of \u2014 well, use your imagination. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s built a chalet here with very thick bulletproof glass,\u201d he says, adding that he shares a builder with \u201cReebo.\u201dPeople say Bach runs this town. The son of a local farmer, he decides whose calls get returned and who will play well with the Bertarelli, Fayed, Flick and Goulandris families. I turn up at the Alpina, expecting to meet him in an ascot, drunk on the gl\u00fchwein of power. Bach, who is the cousin of the comparatively dandified Lorenz Bach, disappoints with a simple ruddy-faced geniality as he relates the saga of this controversially euthanized hotel and its flashy resurrection. The Alpina is just a one-minute drive from its arch-competitor, the Palace \u2014 practically across the street. \u201cVe are a bit higher,\u201d says Bach, checking his fingernails and grinning. \u201cImportant point.\u201d Another important point: Bach is now very, very rich.Despite Gstaad\u2019s billionaire tax exiles and their fortunes, most of the area\u2019s farming families, whose land the rich have been gnawing over the years, haven\u2019t fared nearly as well. \u201cWhich good-hearted millionaire would grant us a generous donation,\u201d asked an ad in the local newspaper Anzeiger von Saanen, \u201cso that we do not have to give up our farm?\u201d The majority investor in the Alpina is the Senegal sugar baron Jean-Claude Mimran, a Morocco-born Jew (something people around town tend to mention) and onetime co-owner of Lamborghini, some of whose children have attended Le Rosey. Unsurprisingly, the dealer Larry Gagosian has been seen sharking around the Alpina, hangout to Mimran\u2019s handsome 26-year-old son, Nachson, who controls the hotel\u2019s revolving art collection.Winning the favor of Bach is essential to anyone who wants to do business here: Bach mentions the powerful Swiss People\u2019s Party, popular with Gstaad\u2019s farmers and famous for getting minarets banned and a shockingly xenophobic poster showing black and brown hands grabbing at a pile of Swiss passports. Building projects still require a sign-off from the commune via big town meetings where \u201ceverybody goes and rises [sic] the hand,\u201d says Bach. The commune has another pressing concern: global warming. Gstaad is at a lower elevation than other \u201csnow secure\u201d resorts higher in the clouds, not that enough people ski here anyway. The Eagle had to acquire a majority stake in the nearby lift when its operator went out of business. To protect their own copious investment in the town, Bach teamed up with Ecclestone and Mimran to buy the rights to the glacier ski area next door, nattily rebranded Glacier 3000. It can be an irascible peak prone to gusting winds and sudden ice showers, but is skiable November through early May. Serious downhillers adore it. Some moguls commute by helicopter to the top, where they can see the Matterhorn and all the way to France and Italy. \u201cIt changes your heart, this view,\u201d says Paul and Linda McCartney\u2019s former ski instructor Thomas Ischer.The deep-pocketed arts patron Maja Hoffmann, who helped fund \u201cElevation\u201d and is lately a permanent resident, considers the show a success (even if she has dropped off the board of Les Arts Gstaad, waiting to see what happens). There are many blue-chip collections in this town, which makes it tantalizing to artists seeking buyers.A picture caption last Sunday with an article about the growing skirmishes between the old guard in Gstaad, Switzerland, and the village\u2019s newer inhabitants, using information from a photo agency, misidentified the building shown. It was the Grand Hotel Alpina, demolished in 1995 \u2014 not the Palace Hotel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beijing Is Directing Hong Kong Strategy, Government Insiders Say", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe drawn curtains of the speeding vans obscure the Hong Kong officials riding inside, headed for the luxurious Bauhinia Villa in Shenzhen, where throngs of Communist Party officials from Beijing wait to lay plans for handling the demonstrations.According to interviews with six current and former Hong Kong and Chinese government officials, as well as a range of experts, it is China\u2019s national leaders, more than Hong Kong\u2019s, who have been directing the broad strokes of the response to the crisis. With Beijing\u2019s needs foremost in mind, they have tried to balance a steadfast refusal to give ground on the protesters\u2019 demands for democratic elections with the need to avoid widespread bloodshed that would further destabilize the city.\u201cClearly, it\u2019s Beijing that is dominating the decisions about this movement,\u201d said Jin Zhong, the editor of Open, a Hong Kong current affairs magazine that focuses on Communist Party politics. \u201cOf course, they wouldn\u2019t admit that.\u201dThe Bauhinia resort is owned by the Central Liaison Office, an arm of the Chinese government that has played a prominent role in Hong Kong during the protests here. President Xi Jinping of China, who is also the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, has been briefed at least once a day on developments in Hong Kong, according to two people involved in Hong Kong\u2019s and Beijing\u2019s decision making.\u201cThey treat it as a challenge to Beijing\u2019s governing power in Hong Kong,\u201d Brian Fong Chi-hang, an assistant professor at the Hong Kong Institute of Education and a former city government official, said of the national leadership. \u201cBecause of this, I\u2019m sure that the Chinese government has basically controlled the whole process.\u201dThe Hong Kong authorities\u2019 response to the crisis has been notable for its improvisatory nature, veering between forceful and hesitant, vaguely conciliatory and dismissively critical. Many observers have seen those shifts as the missteps of a confused local government, but in fact they reflect the dilemmas created by China\u2019s rival priorities, experts and current and former officials said.The Chinese leaders want to avoid bloodshed in Hong Kong that, even on a much more modest scale, could echo the 1989 crackdown on protests in Beijing, which left deep political scars. A harsh crackdown under the glare of the international news media would damage China\u2019s reputation and alarm Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry, the core of its economy.Yet Beijing is also deeply averse to concessions that could defuse the protests, out of fear that the least sign of compromise would embolden other challenges across China. They have also indicated that they will not abandon Hong Kong\u2019s embattled leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, known as C.Y.\u201cI suspect the central government\u2019s line to C.Y. is: No compromise on political reform, but also no bloodshed,\u201d said Joseph Wong Wing-ping, a former senior official in Hong Kong. \u201cThe central government doesn\u2019t like any substantial sign which may indicate or may suggest that they are willing to be a little bit soft.\u201dInitial measures to forcibly disperse the protests, including the use of tear gas, provoked strong public revulsion in Hong Kong, so officials switched to a \u201cwait them out\u201d approach that has put immense pressure on the city\u2019s police force, interspersed with occasional moves to clear street barricades.\u201cIn a way, the government is asking the police to do a political job,\u201d Mr. Wong said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political problem which is not being solved politically.\u201dMainland officials try to maintain the appearance that they are staying at arm\u2019s length, reflecting the city\u2019s special status in China. They do not take part in the daily meetings of the Hong Kong government\u2019s interagency security committee, according to a person heavily involved in Hong Kong\u2019s decision making.\u201cThey don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are in very close contact.\u201dThe Hong Kong and Chinese officials interviewed for this article spoke on condition of anonymity, citing strict bans by both governments on any public discussion of Beijing\u2019s role here.On the underlying political issue \u2014 the protesters\u2019 demand for open elections for Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive \u2014 both the city administration and Beijing have been more forthcoming. Beijing rejects the demand as unlawful and politically unacceptable, and Mr. Leung has stressed publicly that Beijing sets the rules for how his successors will be chosen.Beijing has also warned publicly that the demonstrations in Hong Kong, which have come to be called the Umbrella Movement, must not become a \u201ccolor revolution,\u201d a term it uses for anti-Communist uprisings that it says are orchestrated by the West.\u201cBeijing has increasingly adopted a national security perspective towards Hong Kong issues,\u201d said Mr. Fong, the former city official. \u201cThe overriding objective of the whole Communist regime now is how to preserve and stabilize Communist power.\u201dBeijing has pressed that agenda through the Central Liaison Office, whose director, Zhang Xiaoming, has been more outspoken on Hong Kong policies than his predecessors were. His critics here see his public stance as an affront to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.In late 2012, Mr. Zhang argued in a paper that the central Chinese government must improve and regularize policies for Hong Kong officials to report to their mainland counterparts.The Chinese government declined to comment on the role of the Central Liaison Office in managing the protests. \u201cIt is very natural that the central government is paying high attention to what is happening in Hong Kong,\u201d a mainland Chinese official said.Chinese officials have often used the Bauhinia Villa as a forward camp for dealing with bouts of political tensions in Hong Kong.The resort stands next to a pristine reservoir in a wooded government reserve, with tall trees to shield guests from the noise and dust of Shenzhen, a frenetic commercial city. With several hundred rooms, 10 villas, tennis courts and a large swimming pool, it is a comfortable, if isolated, place to spend time during the protests.Only government officials and business leaders on a specially approved list are allowed to rent rooms there, a receptionist at the resort said. She said the resort was now fully booked and that it was impossible to say when a room might become available.As the policies set there have been carried out by the local government in Hong Kong, the protesters have focused their ire on Mr. Leung, the city leader, especially after video images became public this week showing what appeared to be police brutality. They have demanded his resignation or dismissal, but Mr. Leung seems unlikely to lose his job.He won an unusually forthright endorsement from Beijing on Wednesday, in a front-page commentary in People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s top newspaper. His handling of the protests has \u201cwon the full affirmation\u201d of central leaders, the paper said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the status of Hong Kong at one point.

{"Headline": "Ukraine and Russia Reach Accord on Natural Gas Deliveries", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Russian and Ukrainian officials reached an agreement on Thursday night to resume Russian deliveries of natural gas to prevent shortages over the winter.The deal caps months of laborious talks under the aegis of European Union authorities on how much, and how soon, Ukraine needed to pay Russia for gas it has already consumed, and on the terms for future deliveries.The standoff between Moscow and Kiev also prompted concerns in Europe that Russian gas piped across Ukraine, a former Soviet state, could be interrupted.There is \u201cno reason for people in Europe to stay cold this winter,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, said at a news conference. Ukraine and Russia should \u201cact as reliable partners,\u201d he said.The shuttle diplomacy reached its climax on Thursday night when Alexander Novak, the Russian energy minister, flew to Brussels for a signing with Yuri Prodan, his Ukrainian counterpart.A week ago, the two men were at loggerheads when Mr. Novak demanded that the European Union help Ukraine pay $1.6 billion to help cover its debts, and after Mr. Prodan demanded that Russia sign a binding agreement to sell gas until next spring at $385 per 1,000 cubic meters.On Thursday night, the ministers signed a deal guaranteeing Russian gas deliveries to Ukraine until March 2015 against a backdrop of the Russian and Ukrainian flags. A second signing took place between the chief executive of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, and his counterpart at Ukraine\u2019s Naftogaz, Andriy Kobolev. Mr. Novak, the Russian minister, told the same news conference he was satisfied that Ukraine \u201cdoes have the funds\u201d to pay for gas during November and December. He said the Ukrainians would pay $3.1 billion in two tranches by the end of the year to cover debts.E.U. officials said those tranches would be based on a preliminary price of $268.50 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas.Mr. Prodan, the Ukrainian minister, told the news conference the deal allowed his country to purchase additional Russian gas at a cost of $378 per 1,000 cubic meters until the end of the year, and at a cost of $365 per 1,000 cubic meters from January to March next year. But Mr. Prodan said any final resolution of the gas feud would need to be settled at international arbitration.G\u00fcnther H. Oettinger, the European Union energy commissioner who has already brokered several rounds of talks, said the European Union and the International Monetary Fund would continue to assist Ukraine financially with its budget, its gas debts, and future gas payments.E.U. officials said they expected Ukraine to pay about $1.5 billion for deliveries of around 4 billion cubic meters of Russian gas by the end of this year.Keeping gas flowing to homes and businesses could be critical to keeping in power in Kiev the kind of pro-Western administration favored by the United States and the European Union, which have staked enormous political and financial capital on Ukraine\u2019s future.The signings were \u201cperhaps the first glimmer of a relaxation in the relationship between the two neighboring countries,\" Mr. Oettinger told the news conference. But Moscow and Kiev may struggle to enforce the deal.The Ukranian economy is still hobbling eight months after the ouster of President Viktor F. Yanukovych in the face of bloody street protests over his decision to align more closely with Russia. And pro-Russian rebels and forces allied with the government in Kiev are contesting parts of eastern Ukraine.The main concern for the European Union was its reliance on the shipment of gas through Ukraine for about one-fifth of its supplies. Gazprom, Russia\u2019s natural gas giant, shut the taps in 2006 and 2009 because of disputes with Ukraine, leaving many homes in Central and Eastern Europe without heat and forcing rationing for industrial customers.The deal was \u201csomething of a coup for E.U. negotiators given the real reluctance on the side of both Ukraine and Russia,\u201d Timothy Ash of Standard Bank in London wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. While \u201cneither side wanted to put pen on paper, neither wanted to be blamed for being the party responsible for vetoing any deal and then being named and shamed,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Ash speculated that German pressure on the government in Kiev may have pushed Ukraine to conclude a deal while the government in Moscow may have been wary the European Union could tighten sanctions and stymie the business interests of Gazprom. The current round of talks began in early May after Gazprom sharply raised the price of gas to Ukraine in March. The price rose after Russia annexed Crimea and imposed an export tariff. In response, Ukraine ceased all payments.By June, Russia had cut supplies again, demanding that Kiev settle its outstanding bills and pay upfront for future deliveries.David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leader Taps Into Chinese Classics in Seeking to Cement Power", "Date": "2014-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 When China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, recently warned officials to ward off the temptations of corruption and Western ideas of democracy, he cited Han Fei, a Chinese nobleman renowned for his stark advocacy of autocratic rule more than 2,200 years ago.At the same time, Mr. Xi has vowed to overhaul the economy, promote social equality, and build a fairer, cleaner legal system, which will be the main topic at a meeting of the party\u2019s Central Committee this month.In his campaign to discipline wayward and corrupt officials, Mr. Xi has invoked Mencius and other ancient thinkers, alongside Mao. Most often, he has embraced Confucius, the sage born around 551 B.C. who advocated a paternalistic hierarchy, to argue that the party should command obedience because it represents \u201ccore values\u201d reaching back thousands of years.\u201cHe who rules by virtue is like the North Star,\u201d he said at a meeting of officials last year, quoting Confucius. \u201cIt maintains its place, and the multitude of stars pay homage.\u201dMr. Xi wants party power to be applied more equitably and cleanly, but he does not want law to circumscribe that power, said Mr. Schell. This has created an \u201cenormous amount of misinterpretation in the West that thinks \u2018rule of law\u2019 is rule of law in a very Western Enlightenment sense of the term,\u201d he said.Mr. Xi\u2019s reverence for Confucius is a far cry from Mao, who attacked Confucian traditions as feudal dregs, to be erased by revolutionary fervor. By reviving tradition, Mr. Xi is riding China\u2019s nostalgic zeitgeist. Its people have increasingly turned to pre-Communist values while they navigate giddying, contentious changes driven by expanding commerce and inequality.\u201cWhere can China\u2019s leaders find their ideas?\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t possibly find them nowadays from Western liberal thought, and so the only source they can look to is ancient Chinese political thinking.\u201dWhere Mr. Xi absorbed his enthusiasm for the classics is not so clear. He entered adulthood during the Cultural Revolution, when ancient tradition was under assault. But Mr. Xi has said he always liked to read, including Chinese classics, even as a teenager sent to labor in the countryside. Professor Yan of Tsinghua, who also came of age in the Cultural Revolution, said Mao\u2019s campaigns against Confucius helped introduce those very ideas to the young.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Changing Demographics May Tip Balance in Race for Mayor in Washington", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A street sign downtown promoting the mayoral candidacy of Muriel Bowser has a single word next to her name: Democrat. Over the four decades that this overwhelmingly left-leaning city has been electing mayors, that has been the only qualification voters have needed to hear.But the surprising strength of Ms. Bowser\u2019s main opponent, a Republican turned independent, reflects the tectonic shifts in the city\u2019s demographics and economy over the past several years. Combined with a weariness over continuing corruption scandals that have plagued Democrats, the contest seems to herald a new era of competitive races here, regardless of the outcome of this one.Ms. Bowser\u2019s competitor, David Catania, is trying for a triple: to become the first white mayor since 1872, the first to be openly gay, and the first non-Democrat since 1974, when residents here began voting in public elections after a century of federal control.In the weeks before Election Day, Mr. Catania has trailed Ms. Bowser in the polls somewhere between 4 and 17 points \u2014 numbers that usually spell death in most races for the underdog, but in a city in which Democrats make up 76 percent of 456,633 registered voters, count as remarkably close.A surge of new residents in the past few years, roughly 80,000 of them new voters; a large number of undecided voters; and the presence of a third candidate, Carol Schwartz, another independent, combine to make the outcome less certain than the traditional two-way two-party contest.\u201cThis race has a fascinating set of circumstances,\u201d said George Derek Musgrove, a historian at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who is writing a book on race and democracy in the District of Columbia.Chief among them, Professor Musgrove said, is the shrinking black population in this city of about 650,000 people. It declined 11 percent from 2001 to 2011, while the white population increased by 31 percent, and the Asian population increased, too.\u201cNo one knows how many new residents will vote, or in what numbers,\u201d Professor Musgrove said.Further, he said, residents, particularly the poor, have looked at the record of the past three administrations on the key issues of education and affordable housing and seen little progress. \u201cFolks don\u2019t quite know if Muriel Bowser can deal with those two problems, so there is a critical mass of people who are willing to try something new.\u201dWhile on the Council, Ms. Bowser has tended toward low-flying legislative targets like regulations on pawn shops. Her focus on neighborhood issues is her special sauce, her campaign says. \u201cShe has made a grass-roots effort to reach the entire district,\u201d said Joaquin McPeek, her spokesman. \u201cIt\u2019s what won her the primary and what we believe will win her the election next week.\u201dMr. Catania, 46, is from Kansas City, Mo., and has served on the City Council for 17 years in several prominent roles, such as chairman of the Health Committee, where he helped increase immunization rates for children citywide.Both candidates are focused on the city\u2019s schools, which have been a central issue in mayoral races over the past decade as the rest of the city\u2019s fortunes have improved.While Ms. Bowser has far stronger support among the city\u2019s black voters, predominantly black neighborhoods do feature some of Mr. Catania\u2019s signs, perhaps in a nod to his work in poorer areas on the eastern side of the city, where he announced his exploration committee for the mayor\u2019s race.Mr. Catania has been frequently criticized for his temperament, which many who have worked with him have described as abrasive.\u201cNo one in the beginning of this campaign gave us much of a chance,\u201d Mr. Catania said. \u201cBut for 17 years in public service, I have been a workhorse serving the needs of people. The establishment candidate is just offering more of the same.\u201dThe mayoralty of the District of Columbia holds a bit of outsize political importance here, because the city has no real voice in Congress and because of the hard-fought history of the job. In 1802, Congress made Washington an incorporated city and permitted residents to elect its Council, but it gave them a mayor appointed by the president. In 1872, residents lost the right to elect local leadership and it was not restored until 1973 when Congress passed the Home Rule Act, paving the way for city residents to elect a mayor and Council the next year.If elected, Ms. Bowser would carry on the tradition that began that year: serving as a black mayor in what was once a predominantly black city, something many voters of all races believe is important. As a Democrat, she would also represent the political leanings of the city.Others are less sure that the mayor\u2019s party really matters. \u201cI always vote for Democrats,\u201d said Andrew Wiseman, 35, a cartographer who blogs about his gentrifying neighborhood, Columbia Heights. However, he is supporting Mr. Catania. \u201cCatania doesn\u2019t seem like a mainstream Republican at all. I don\u2019t think Bowser has been very effective. A lot of people who vote Democrat agree with me.\u201dThe outcome may rest on how many new voters feel the same. \u201cA lot of Democrats may say, \u2018I am not excited, but I will turn out for her,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Professor Musgrove said. \u201cBut I have absolutely no idea how exactly this is going to turn out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Finds Many Corpses, but Not Lost 43", "Date": "2014-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIGUALA, Mexico \u2014 With borrowed shovels and pick axes, the farmers drove their battered pickup trucks to a series of suspicious clearings in the countryside, jumped out and started digging.\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s a spine,\u201d one of the men, part of a citizen police patrol, called out last week, fishing out what appeared to be a piece of spinal column. Soon came other fragments \u2014 a rib? a knee bone?Even with hundreds of soldiers, federal officers, state personnel and local residents on the trail, the search has still not confirmed what happened to the missing students. Instead, it has turned up something just as chilling: a multitude of clandestine graves with unknown occupants right on the outskirts of town, barely concealing the extensive toll organized crime has taken on this nation.The students were reported missing after the local police, now accused of working with a local drug gang, shot to death six people on Sept. 26. Prosecutors say they believe that officers abducted a large number of the students and then turned them over to the gang. The students have not been seen since.Relatives of the students, who were training to be teachers and planning a protest against cuts to their college, agonize over the discovery of each mass grave. Some have given up searching on their own, convinced that a mafia of criminals and politicians knows where they are but are not saying.8 PhotosMany still believe the lost students are alive, joining the distressed fraternity of relatives of the thousands still missing from the drug war in Mexico. Such cases are rarely solved.Hours before the latest possible graves were found, Mar\u00eda Oliveras, the mother of Antonio Santana, one of the missing students, lit a candle and prayed at the campus where she and other relatives are holding a constant vigil.\u201cI just want to know how he is, where he is and what he is doing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they find remains, I don\u2019t want to believe it is him. You have to believe he is alive and for some reason they haven\u2019t turned him over.\u201dIn his first two years in office, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has focused on revamping the economy and drawing foreign investors, earning praise from some economists who say he has set the stage for future growth.But critics argue that in the process, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has largely overlooked the lawlessness of towns like this one, 120 miles south of Mexico City, the evidence of which lies literally just under their surface.\u201cImpunity is the main motivation for these numerous disappearances,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a former Mexican intelligence official. \u201cWe must remember that only one in every five murder cases is solved in Mexico, whereas in the U.S. it\u2019s two out of three cases. This is due to impunity, weak institutions and a decentralized search and localization process.\u201dMembers of the farmer brigades searching for the students \u2014 calling themselves \u201ccommunity police\u201d who have stepped into the vacuum of authority in southern Mexico \u2014 said they were acting on a rash of tips from residents who do not trust any of the professional police.Leaning on a shovel, Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez, a leader of the community police, said he doubted the students could have been buried in this spot because the growth of weeds over it looked thicker than a few weeks would produce.\u201cBut even if it is not them, we can\u2019t let these graves go unsolved,\u201d he said, bringing a halt to the digging. \u201cOnce we find some bones, we stop and let the forensic investigators come in.\u201dIt will take a couple of weeks for the authorities to test all of the new remains discovered in recent days. Prosecutors have confirmed that the corpses and remains in at least five mass graves uncovered so far are human, but they have not yet tied them to any of the students.On Friday, acting again on tips from residents, the farmer brigades searched a hilly trail, looking for caves in which residents believe bodies were left. Along the way, they found what appeared to be a safe house for a gang, littered with bottles, old clothes, candles and a portrait of Jes\u00fas Malverde, a gang icon.Later, a local guide working with them got a threatening telephone call as he headed down the trail from the cave. \u201cStop going up there,\u201d the voice said over and over before hanging up, the man said.The school the students attended, the Escuela Normal Rural Ra\u00fal Isidro Burgos, is a teacher college with radical roots, steeped in revolutionary ferment and slogans.Now parents and other family members of the missing bide their time there, sipping coffee, chatting in clusters and sleeping on mattresses stuffed into classrooms and other spare space.The students had been organizing an Oct. 2 protest against cuts to their state-financed school, but they appear to have gotten into a skirmish with the police when they tried to steal buses to travel to and from the demonstration, human rights groups said.\u201cSometimes I can\u2019t just sit and think,\u201d said the mother of one student at the school, declining to give her name out of fear. She clutched a piece of paper with a prayer for \u201cthe Protection of the Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d written on it.Her husband scoffed at what he considered a big charade on the part of the authorities. \u201cWe can\u2019t search; we don\u2019t know the terrain,\u201d he said with anger. \u201cBut they already know where they are. Just bring him to us.\u201dEleucadio Ortega, another father, said his gut tightened with each report of a grave being found. In the days after his son, Mauricio Ortega, went missing, he searched parts of Iguala with other parents. But they found the effort futile and believe that only informants in the criminal world can provide real leads.He wonders if somehow the students got mistaken for any number of groups in conflict in the state, including a range of guerrilla groups and gangs. But, he said, his son was simply a peasant farmer who wanted to be a teacher to get ahead.\u201cSomebody knows what happened to him and the others,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody needs to bring them back.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico CityAdvertisement"}

Mr. Obama, she told dozens of Democratic donors, has brought a \u201cpassion\u201d to the presidency that would \u201cbe one of the most important and scrutinized and looked at.\u201dShe rambled on about why she considers herself his biggest supporter, including his endorsement of equal pay for women, which the millionaire movie star said was \u201cvery important to me as a working mother.\u201dThen came what was apparently on her mind all along. \u201cYou\u2019re so handsome that I can\u2019t speak properly,\u201d she said before handing the microphone over to Mr. Obama.The crowd \u2014 which included the actors Julia Roberts and Bradley Whitford \u2014 erupted in laughter and cheers.\u201cI\u2019m taking her to the next event,\u201d Mr. Obama said. He then embarked on a roughly 20-minute speech that he has given dozens \u2014 if not hundreds \u2014 of times at fund-raisers in the homes of the rich and famous across the country.He ran through the issues confronting the country. He praised the growth of the economy under his watch. Then he complained about the Republicans\u2019 reluctance to work with him. And he finished by saying that the congressional elections next month were critical to the country\u2019s future.The fund-raiser capped an uneventful day for Mr. Obama, who began a three-day swing through California on Thursday. Earlier, he held a town-hall meeting at Cross Campus, a tech entrepreneurs\u2019 center in Santa Monica, where he discussed issues confronting the generation known as millennials, those born between 1978 and 1997.He reiterated that he was \u201cunequivocally committed\u201d to net neutrality \u2014 the idea that all Internet content is treated equally. \u201cIt has unleashed the power of the Internet, and we don\u2019t want to lose that,\u201d he said.He also addressed the immigration fight, predicting that Republicans would be committing political \u201csuicide\u201d in the long run if they did not act on an overhaul.The president followed up with a surprise visit to the cramped campaign office of Ted Lieu, a Democratic state senator who is running for the House seat being vacated by Henry Waxman, a Democratic stalwart.Mr. Obama, in a reference to his own history as a state politician in Illinois, told the Lieu volunteers that \u201cstate senators make outstanding members of Congress.\u201d He praised the volunteers, adding, \u201cIf I\u2019m not directly shaking your hand, you should be on the phone,\u201d he said.But it was the Democratic National Committee fund-raiser at Ms. Paltrow\u2019s home that was the day\u2019s memorable event. Guests paid $1,000 to simply listen to Mr. Obama\u2019s speech, and $15,000 to have dinner with him.It was not the first fund-raiser that Ms. Paltrow has hosted for Mr. Obama \u2014 although it was the first one he has actually attended. In 2012, Ms. Paltrow held an event for the president\u2019s re-election campaign in London, where she was then living with her ex-husband, Chris Martin of the band Coldplay.Mr. Obama said that he did not attend that fund-raiser because it would not have done him any good to knock on Londoners\u2019 doors. He sent his campaign manager, Jim Messina, in his place.Ms. Paltrow\u2019s home appeared like something created by Restoration Hardware on a multimillion-dollar budget. The brick exterior is painted gray, and there is a gravel driveway, an outdoor fireplace and a small fountain in the backyard.As the actress spoke, waiters wearing all black stood behind the crowd holding hors d\u2019oeuvres. Many guests held glasses of wine or cocktails as they listened.Other than her remarks about the president\u2019s looks, Ms. Paltrow stayed on message. She said that the president needed a Congress controlled by Democrats to move the nation in the right direction.\u201cIt would be wonderful if we are able to give this man all the power he needs to accomplish the things he needs to,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said.After handing the microphone to the president, she sat down next to her two children \u2014 Moses and Apple \u2014 to listen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big-Ticket Fliers Poised to Gain Still More Miles", "Date": "2014-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: A Cut AboveWith 1,275 aircraft and flights to 369 destinations, Delta Air Lines is considerably larger than Swiss International Air Lines, which operates 90 aircraft and flies to 84 destinations. But it is neither Delta\u2019s size nor its route map that is challenging the Swiss flagship carrier on flights between America and Europe. Luring premium flyers from Swiss and other international airlines could be one of the consequences of a big change in how the Atlanta-based Delta and Chicago-based United treat their loyalty club members, according to several industry executives. In 2015, Delta and United will start linking the price that people pay for a ticket to the number of award miles they receive. Enhancing the rich-get-richer approach, passengers with elite status will earn double or even triple the number of miles actually flown, while economy-fare customers will see their mileage awards dwindle 28 to 43 percent, according to analysts\u2019 projections.\u201cIn an industry where everything is plain vanilla, Delta and United have tossed a bunch of strawberry into the pile,\u201d said Jay Sorensen, founder of the airline marketing company IdeaWorks, based in Wisconsin. Keeping with the ice cream analogy, Mr. Sorensen called the move a \u201cdelicious lab experiment\u201d because so much of what will happen is unknown. Airlines around the world, Mr. Sorensen said, are \u201cabout to see the power of loyalty on the top and the bottom end.\u201dWithout actually denying that part of Delta\u2019s strategy was to poach customers from other international carriers, a company spokesman, Anthony Black, said the changes were made with American travelers in mind, since they are the majority of Delta\u2019s customers \u2014 though, he added, \u201cnon-U.S. premium customers can benefit as well.\u201d Regardless of nationality, Mr. Black said, \u201cthe 2015 SkyMiles program will more fairly reward customers who spend more on Delta.\u201d Unlike other businesses, airlines had long ignored the relationship between price and benefits, granting the same number of miles regardless of ticket price, which can vary considerably. But over the past decade, airlines around the world started changing their practices, from Qantas in Australia to WestJet in Canada. Economy-class passengers may not have liked the change, but airline economics are such that premium-class customers are disproportionately larger contributors to revenue, so airlines are eager to secure them. But with the American carriers offering so many bonus miles to their most valuable customers, Mr. Sorensen predicts, companies such as Singapore, Cathay Pacific and British Airways, which are known for superior customer service, still could lose those passengers on lucrative international flights. Delta and United \u201chave relied upon the payoff associated with frequent flier programs to entice passengers to stay with them,\u201d Mr. Sorensen said. \u201cThey have been unable to complete on the basis of service. If you really wanted service, you would never fly a U.S. airline.\u201dAt Swiss, the push is on to present the airline not just as a way to get from A to B, but as a cultural experience that begins at the airport \u2014 or what Patrick Heymann, its senior director for the Americas, calls the airline\u2019s \u201cSwissness.\u201d Swiss competes with Delta on many routes and, like other airlines in the same situation, it is assessing just how much of a threat the loyalty program changes at Delta and United will be. \u201cWhat we are viewing internally at the moment is how can we compete as an alliance, as a joint venture,\u201d he said.Swiss and United are members of the 27-airline Star Alliance, where squabbles have already erupted over differences in how individual airlines calculate elite passenger status \u2014 a perk based on the number of flights rather than miles flown. Within the alliance, airlines agree to honor partners\u2019 status programs by giving their members access to airport lounges and upgrades, among other benefits. \u201cIn the end, it is basically you provide an add-on and it makes people rebuy your product. That\u2019s the basic equation,\u201d said Harald Deprosse, managing director of Miles & More, Lufthansa\u2019s frequent flier program.But when the Star Alliance members Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines had a falling out last year over Lufthansa\u2019s accusation that Turkish was saturating the German market, the German company made it harder for its Miles & More members to accrue miles for flights taken on Turkish. The alliance promises passengers flying on member airlines a seamless experience, but the tussle was just one of the most recent examples of how the struggle to work with competitors can expose the stitches holding alliance members together.Frequent flier programs and status awards \u201chave always been and will continue to be a marketing tool with which carriers will try to differentiate themselves from others, even if they are in the same alliance\u201d said Markus R\u00fcdiger, a Star Alliance spokesman. To further entice loyalty, \u201ca lot of them are adding a tier above gold, which you can only achieve if you fly on that airline\u2019s metal.\u201dStephen Nicols, an Australian businessman, has seen the policy differentiation first-hand. On his travels around Asia, he will sometimes fly Asiana Airlines, which is in the Star Alliance, and sometimes Cathay Pacific or Qantas, both members of Oneworld. He recalled comparing the prices from Sydney to Seoul and finding that an economy ticket on Qantas was $1,500 more than a business-class ticket on Asiana. \u201cFrom a personal point of view, I don\u2019t see any value in having something cost twice the amount of money for the same service,\u201d he said. \u201cI am flying enough that I just accumulate points and I\u2019m not looking at them in terms of \u2018I need to maximize the points I get.\u201d\u2019 Mr. Nicols and a colleague, Klaasjan Tukker, spoke from Singapore, where they were attending a training session held by their employer, Adobe Systems. (Only in rare circumstances does the company policy allow them to purchase premium tickets.)Mr. Tukker, who lives in the Netherlands, flies within Europe about 80 percent of the time, on short flights of 1,000 miles or less. When he buys discount-fare tickets, he reckons that his mileage accumulation is reduced by 25 to 75 percent. \u201cFrom an airline perspective, I think it is reasonable,\u201d said Mr. Tukker, who mostly flies on KLM, a member, like Delta, of the SkyTeam Alliance. He says he likes KLM for its convenience and because, making 70 to 80 flights a year, he has premier status, since this is based on number of trips, not miles flown. \u201cMy main hub is Amsterdam, and the majority of service is out of Amsterdam,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I would move to the U.S. for business, I would have to re-evaluate my whole loyalty to see if it is more beneficial to start flying with a different group.\u201d With so many moving parts in the airline programs worldwide and so many categories of traveler, predicting how and when the latest changes in loyalty programs will ripple through the industry is difficult. Rewarding the best customers means penalizing others, and that could have unintended consequences. An airline such as Lufthansa, which flies large-capacity airplanes like the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747-800, cannot afford to forget the passengers in the cheap seats.\u201cWhether this turns out to be successful, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Deprosse said. \u201cWe have to take care of our status customers, but if you take care only of this segment you will not be able fill a 400-seat aircraft.\u201dAdvertisement"}

While the Chinese flag flies over Hong Kong, the demonstrations there spring from a very different political system influenced by the British, who ruled the territory from 1841 until 1997.Demonstrators in Hong Kong are engaged in a peaceful extended protest in the heart of a Chinese city.But there are major differences.Beijing is the capital of China, and the protests in 1989 were intensely embarrassing for its leadership, coinciding with a historic summit meeting with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.Hong Kong is more than 1,200 miles away from Beijing. And in the ensuing quarter-century, China\u2019s economy has globalized. Hong Kong is China\u2019s financial window to the world, and any violent crackdown in Hong Kong would have stark effects on financial markets around the world and could hurt China\u2019s economy.Hong Kong is not an independent country. It does not have ambassadors, and the People\u2019s Liberation Army garrisons troops in the city. Any changes to the Basic Law require ratification by the country\u2019s legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress, which is controlled by the Communist Party.For a candidate to appear on the ballot for chief executive, he or she would have to get more than half the votes of the nominating committee, which would be identical to the election committee that had picked previous chief executives. This ensures that only candidates approved by Beijing would be nominated.For nine days, waves of pro-democracy protests engulfed Hong Kong, swelling at times to tens of thousands of people and raising tensions with Beijing.The decision in August to limit, not expand, access to the election provoked pro-democracy activists.Advertisement"}

I should have known better than to try to score some thousand-dollar face cream, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself.I took rolls of toilet paper from nightclubs I worked at in the 1980s and legal pads from television shows that employed me in the 1990s. I find it impossible to return from a hotel stay without a suitcase\u2019s worth of soaps and shampoos, and when I have treated myself to a $35 lip stain, I feel compelled to try to get just a little bit more for the money I shouldn\u2019t be spending in the first place. Even though it defies the logic of both capitalism and my own ethical code, I would also like to get stuff free. I am not alone.We had recognized something of ourselves in Ms. Aniston\u2019s portrayal of a woman who once had more-remunerative employment but was now working as a housekeeper, grasping to enjoy even a smidgen of the daily amenities afforded her clients and tonier friends. The memory of counting pennies can stay with you, and if you\u2019re part of the new freelance economy, that memory can be as recent as last week and may also be part of your immediate future. The siren song of the luxe life compels Kia owners to test-drive Teslas, and renters to crash open houses we can\u2019t afford. But Sample Nation beware: The cosmetic companies are onto us. Gone are the days when Kiehl\u2019s, once known as one of the most generous of suppliers, doled out shower gels and moisturizers that lasted for weeks. At one of the brand\u2019s stores recently, I was required to provide an email address and ZIP code before being permitted to \u201csign out\u201d those now ubiquitous single-use foil packets.\u201cWe used to give out deluxe-size samples,\u201d said the comedian Brian Finkelstein, who worked at Kiehl\u2019s for seven years, until 2002. \u201cWhen Jami Heidegger owned the store [now a division of L\u2019Or\u00e9al], she encouraged us to give to people who looked like they couldn\u2019t afford to purchase. We\u2019d judge them by their shoes.\u201d That explains why I was often on the receiving end in the \u201980s. I regularly stopped in to enjoy the store\u2019s air-conditioning while toiling in the avant-garde theaters on the blocks adjacent to the flagship East Village store, wearing cowboy boots held together with duct tape. If I am any example, gifting can build brand loyalty. All these years later, when I\u2019m feeling flush, I\u2019ll indulge in a bottle of Kiehl\u2019s coriander shower gel.But those determined to track down the elusive contemporary swag will find it an unpredictable and ethically fraught pursuit.

Maybe there\u2019s a hedge fund manager who takes on clients because they really, really like them, and you can be \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d without anyone\u2019s feelings getting hurt. But if you\u2019re looking for a free reliable source of a cherished product, or even a sampling with a purchase, you\u2019ll have to depend on luck and the kindness of strangers. Based on my own admittedly unscientific quest, lines like Dior and Clarins may bestow their prepacked multiuse freebies upon you, but you will need to cruise the counter at just the right hour, on just the right day, and not right after a gifting event in which samples are offered \u201cfree with a purchase,\u201d which isn\u2019t really free at all, now is it? As I watched a Dior representative carefully pumping serums into what looked like Barbie-size beer steins, I imagined the carpal tunnel she\u2019ll develop if she doesn\u2019t find a new line of work. By the time she finished, not only was it impossible not to purchase something, it was also hard to resist offering to underwrite her physical therapy.The more expensive the line, the more elaborate the process. At Armani, a tenacious representative told me that the company\u2019s deluxe Crema Nera was such a coveted prize, it was not advertised anywhere; it was a \u201cword of mouth\u201d product. With tousled hair and quavering voice, one associate at La Mer looked as if she had barely escaped being trampled by stampeding rhinos. The line regularly offers coupons in fashion magazines redeemable for a $20-value sample jar, minus the cost of the magazine, of course, and she had just survived a swarm of extreme couponers who had become irate when she announced her supply was depleted. Taking pity on me, she scooped me a scooch and I was schooled in all things La Mer. \u201cDid you know that if you don\u2019t heat up the miracle broth, you might as well be slathering chicken broth on your face?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you know that you must always use upward strokes when applying skin care?\u201d\u201cI think I did know that,\u201d I said, filing instructions into the recesses of my brain for the \u201cnever\u201d day in the nonexistent future when le miraculous is within my reach.

I found myself feeling that I couldn\u2019t in good conscience accept more than a few. By the time I unloaded my purse, all the handmade sample labels had smeared. That is why I now have a collection of Chiclet-size vials of Laminated Sofa Cloth (La Mer Soft Cream?), Nomad Moratorium (Normal Moisturizer, brand unknown) and Right Serafim (Night Serum, gifted directly from whom? ...

Channeling my inner Aniston, I lined up my stash on the bathroom counter and phoned Nicole Holofcener, the director of \u201cFriends With Money.\u201d When I asked if the character was based on personal experience, she sighed and admitted: \u201cHere\u2019s the most embarrassing part.

{"Headline": "Inflation? Deflation Is New Risk", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low Finance\u201cBe very, very careful what you put into that head, because you will never, ever get it out.\u201d \u2014 Cardinal Thomas Wolseyon King Henry VIIISo it is with inflation. A generation of economists and central bankers who lived through the 1970s learned that there is a large risk from runaway inflation and that steps must be taken to stop it before it gets out of control.In reality, the threat these days comes from inflation that is too low, or even from deflation. Many of the world\u2019s economic problems would be reduced if we could get more inflation than we have now.Unfortunately, some central banks concluded after the first bit of revival from the Great Recession that it was time to tighten credit, lest superlow interest rates bring a burst of inflation pressure. They saw a need to confront the possibility of soaring prices before it was too late.The Swedish central bank, which began to raise interest rates in 2010, in part because of worries about a housing price bubble, completed its reversal of policy on Tuesday, cutting its target interest rate to zero after raising it as high as 2 percent in 2011. But Lars E. O. Svensson, a noted economist who resigned from the Swedish central bank board last year, warned that more steps might be needed, including negative interest rates.The Swedish blunder was not as great as the one committed by the European Central Bank when it raised rates in 2008 \u2014 a worse time to do that is hard to imagine \u2014 and then again in 2011. Mario Draghi, who became E.C.B. president in late 2011, has done yeoman work to offset the damage of that policy, but consumer price indexes in several eurozone countries are indicating deflation has arrived.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee sort of ended its program of buying long-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, known as Q.E. for quantitative easing. But it will not unwind those purchases, at least for the time being. As the securities it owns mature, the Fed will roll over the proceeds into new securities.Now, with quantitative easing ending, what has the Fed accomplished?It has helped the economy, although not nearly to the extent that might have been hoped. Inflation, far from accelerating as some conservative economists forecast, has been running consistently below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. The Fed\u2019s preferred measure, the index of personal consumption expenditures, is up 1.5 percent over the last 12 months, both overall and excluding volatile food and energy prices. It has been more than two years since either measure was up as much as 2 percent. Imagine the criticism hurled at the Fed if inflation had been running above its target for that long.What we have not heard from the Fed is any clarification of what it will do if inflation does not pick up, let alone if it falls close to or below zero.\u201cThe real question,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, \u201cis how the F.O.M.C. will express its commitment to getting inflation back to 2 percent.\u201d Until he left the Fed this summer, he was a special adviser to the last two Fed leaders, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen.Mr. Faust was speaking before the Fed\u2019s statement on Wednesday. The answer was that the Fed did not have many words about the question, let alone the \u201cwords with teeth\u201d that Mr. Faust believes are likely to become appropriate.\u201cThe likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year\u201d was all the Fed statement had to say about the issue.There is nothing magic about 2 percent, and some economists think that a 3 or 4 percent target might make more sense. But you don\u2019t have to favor a higher target to realize the current inflation rate is not helping the economy.At the moment, the threat of deflation is clearly greater in Europe than it is in the United States, and presumably some of the factors forcing prices down, including falling agricultural commodity and energy prices and a strengthening dollar, will diminish as time goes on. But if those weakening commodity prices signal a coming decline in economic activity around the world, the picture could worsen.What is needed is for Fed officials, and other economists, to make clear some of the damage that low inflation can inflict on an economy. They make adjustments harder for countries that need to become more competitive. Cutting nominal wages is difficult and can be devastating for workers facing fixed costs, like mortgage expenses. But if there is inflation, real wages can decline as nominal wages remain level.It has become common for some economists to denounce the effect of low interest rates on fixed-income investors, but that is not the complete story. Certainly those with money to invest now face an unappealing set of choices. But those who bought long-term securities years ago \u2014 when inflation was expected to be considerably higher than it now is \u2014 are receiving more value than they expected.The much discussed ratio of national debt to gross domestic product also suffers. Consider the 18 nations in the eurozone. Collectively, their national debts rose by 7.8 percent in 2012 and 2013, forcing up the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio by 5.2 percentage points. From 2004 to 2006, their debts rose nearly as rapidly, by 7.4 percent. But the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio actually fell by a percentage point. At the time, European economies were growing and inflation was also pushing up the nominal gross domestic product figures. Now there is little if any growth or inflation, and the result is to worsen the debt picture.The markets inferred from the Fed\u2019s statement that credit tightening through higher interest rates would more likely arrive sooner than expected, and the dollar rose. If the economic growth and job figures continue to look good, and if inflation manages to rise at least a little, that forecast could be a good one.But what will happen if inflation \u2014 and inflation expectations \u2014 do decline? So far, as can be seen in the Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted quarterly by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the 10-year inflation forecast has remained stable at 2 percent. If it began to fall, that would catch the attention of Fed officials.But the bond market is not so confident. The market inflation forecast can be estimated by calculating the inflation rate at which a purchase of a normal Treasury security would be no better or worse than the purchase of an inflation-protected Treasury security of the same maturity. At the end of last year, the 10-year inflation forecast was 2.2 percent; now it is 1.9 percent. The one-year forecast then was 1.5 percent; now it is a forecast of deflation, negative 0.75 percent.What could the Fed do if it turns out deflation is a real threat? In theory, it could resume quantitative easing. It could also jawbone Congress to provide more fiscal stimulus. If the Republicans win control of the Senate in next week\u2019s elections, the first alternative might bring angry denunciations from both sides of Capitol Hill. The second might simply be ignored.As long as deflation is a possibility, the Fed would be well advised to explain, again and again, why inflation that is too low is also bad for the economy. The lesson that high inflation is a threat is well known to politicians and voters. There is a need, as Cardinal Wolsey might have said, to get something else into their heads.The High & Low Finance column on Friday, about the risks of deflation, misstated the market forecast for the 10-year inflation rate. It is 1.9 percent, not 1.7 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Racial Disparity in Mortgage Refinancing Data", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMortgagesA sharp drop in mortgage refinancing activity last year was caused almost entirely by less participation among white and Asian borrowers, according to an analysis of data obtained through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Refinancing volume nationwide declined 25 percent in 2013 from the previous year, according to the center\u2019s examination of the disclosure data, which reveals lending patterns and which lenders are required to make public. While the retreat in refinancing activity was expected, Mr. George said he was surprised to see such variation in the pace across different racial and ethnic groups. The number of white borrowers who refinanced fell by 27.4 percent, and activity among Asian borrowers shrank by 35.8 percent. Among African-American and Hispanic borrowers, however, the decrease in refinancing activity was barely noticeable, at 3 percent and 5.5 percent.The center is still researching a solid explanation for the disparity, but Mr. George has some theories. One focuses on interest rates. African-American and Hispanic borrowers entered the housing market in greater numbers at the height of the housing bubble, when home prices were high and rates were above 6 percent, he said. After the bubble burst and rates began to sink, the share of white and Asian borrowers taking out new mortgages grew. For them, Mr. George said, \u201ca refinance in 2013 might not make sense,\u201d as a rise in rates meant less potential payment reduction. Another of his theories is that lenders focused on refinancing big loans first, which tend to be held by whites and Asians, then \u201cmoved on to less profitable refinances.\u201d An improving economy also likely played a role, Mr. George said. With more homes returning to positive equity and unemployment easing, more African-American and Hispanic borrowers have become eligible for refinancing.As of the second quarter, according to CoreLogic, a property data provider, the share of mortgaged homes still in negative equity had shrunk to around 11 percent, off about four percentage points from the same period last year.

{"Headline": "Setting Course to Reclaim the Past ", "Date": "2015-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTheater ReviewFor that reason alone, it\u2019s hard not to root for this ambitious, earnest musical, which opened on Sunday night at the Neil Simon Theater. Rich in atmosphere \u2014 I half expected to see sea gulls reeling in the rafters \u2014 and buoyed by a seductive score that ranks among the best composed by a rock or pop figure for Broadway, the musical explores with grit and compassion the lives of the town\u2019s disenfranchised citizens, left behind as the industry that gave them their livelihood set sail for foreign lands.But along with its accomplishments, which include a host of vital performances from its ample cast under the direction of Joe Mantello, \u201cThe Last Ship\u201d also has its share of nagging flaws. The book, by John Logan (\u201cRed\u201d) and Brian Yorkey (\u201cNext to Normal\u201d), and inspired in part by Sting\u2019s own upbringing in the northeast England town Wallsend, where the show is set, is unfocused and diffuse. It\u2019s hamstrung by a division between a David versus Goliath story \u2014 of the little folk fighting against the faceless forces of the global economy \u2014 and a romantic love triangle. A prologue introduces us to the restless young Gideon (Collin Kelly-Sordelet), who yearns to escape the town where he\u2019s grown up, and where his forebears have always worked the shipyards. Even after an injury at the yards leaves his father, Joe (Jamie Jackson), unable to work, the pugnacious Gideon rebels against the life ordained for him. \u201cHis life may be over,\u201d he tells his girlfriend, Meg (Dawn Cantwell), \u201cbut mine\u2019s not.\u201d Although she refuses to join him, Gideon sets out \u201cto find us a berth at the end of the earth,\u201d as he sings, and promises to return to rescue her.Youthful dreams have a way of evaporating when they meet the hard exigencies of life, and when Gideon returns 15 years later (Michael Esper plays the adult Gideon, Rachel Tucker the adult Meg), he finds that the town has sunk into economic depression, the shipyards have closed and Meg has moved on. Her almost-fianc\u00e9 is Arthur Millburn (the excellent Aaron Lazar, making the most of his gentle love ballad), who, in alliance with a local businessman, urges the unemployed workers to take the only jobs on offer: at a new salvage company.Against considerable odds, and for that matter all real-world logic, the townsfolk rally behind a plan to open the shipyards themselves, and set to work building one last ship. What exactly they will do with this vessel \u2014 sell it to Carnival Cruises? hop aboard and sail away into some brighter future? \u2014 is among the questions the show doesn\u2019t quite answer. But there is plenty to distract us from this quixotic, quasi-symbolic endeavor. In a development that can be seen coming from a few leagues away, we learn Gideon is the biological father of Meg\u2019s teenage son, Tom (Mr. Kelly-Sordelet, again), and that Meg still feels a tug of affection for her old flame. In one of the show\u2019s prettiest ballads, Meg, played with a tough hide and a sweet soul by the beautiful Ms. Tucker, sings a duet with her younger self in which she confesses she still \u201ccounts the boats returning from the sea.\u201d Also claiming the town\u2019s attention is the decline of the local priest, Father O\u2019Brien (Fred Applegate), who knocks back pints with the best of them, and isn\u2019t above colorful profanity. Although Mr. Applegate plays the role with a nicely studied restraint, the character skirts stock stereotype, and his cancer diagnosis strikes a sentimental note that only adds to the busy traffic of the plot. While I haven\u2019t closely followed his long career as a rock star, I was impressed that Sting\u2019s songs for \u201cThe Last Ship\u201d never feel like pop tunes awkwardly shoehorned into a ready-made narrative. The pungent lyrics spring directly from character and situation. (The score includes songs from Sting\u2019s concept album of the same name, as well as new compositions and four songs from other Sting albums.) The varied score draws on the antique sounds of sea chanteys, and often has a heavily Celtic sound \u2014 with a little Kurt Weill thrown in for good measure. Lively characterizations from the cast can only go so far to paper over the problem of overpopulation. Gideon, Meg, Arthur, Jackie, young Tom and Father O\u2019Brien all play significant roles in the plot \u2014 with the chorus of workers and wives roistering around them \u2014 so there isn\u2019t sufficient room to explore any of the characters in real depth, with the result that our emotions are only intermittently engaged. How to wade through the crush of culture coming your way this season? Here\u2019s a guide to 100 events that have us especially excited, in order of appearance.Mr. Esper, as the wayward Gideon, sings with rich feeling, and does his best to keep the conflicts tearing at his character lucid. Mr. Kelly-Sordelet brings a brash vitality to Tom, and Mr. Nail commands attention whenever his stern character steps into one of the smoky spotlights of Christopher Akerlind\u2019s lighting design, on David Zinn\u2019s imposing metallic set. Once again, the choreographer Steven Hoggett has provided dances that seem naturally to spring from the sinews of the characters. His heavily weighted, earthbound choreography matches both the varied bodies of the cast and the emotional tone of the show. The movement derives from foot-stomping anger and frustration rather than the ebullience of spirit that usually sends people airborne in musicals.Airborne is what this musical definitely is not. While it shares a working-class milieu with popular shows like \u201cOnce,\u201d \u201cKinky Boots\u201d and \u201cBilly Elliot,\u201d \u201cThe Last Ship\u201d doesn\u2019t aim for the romantic allure or jubilant spirit of those more formulaic shows; it\u2019s fundamentally about loss, regret and unhappy or ambiguous endings. Those are all worthy subjects of musical dramatization, as some of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s great shows and many an opera have established. But for all the ruminative, haunting beauty of its score, this musical often feels dramatically landlocked \u2014 like a ship without a crew.Tickets powered by TicketmasterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. and France on Collision Course Over Budget", "Date": "2014-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUXEMBOURG \u2014 The eurozone\u2019s finance ministers began making last-ditch efforts on Monday to avoid a clash with France, which must formally submit its budget for scrutiny by the European Union authorities by the middle of the week.\u201cThe figures we\u2019re hearing from Paris are not very hopeful,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the group of eurozone finance ministers, told reporters on Monday as he arrived at the monthly meeting. Recent declarations by the government in Paris were cause for \u201csome worry,\u201d he added.Ministers agreed on Monday that bloc\u2019s fiscal rule book was \u201can anchor of confidence in the E.U.\u201d that needed to be preserved, Mr. Dijsselbloem told a news conference after the meeting.There are concerns, however, that by pushing France too hard the European Union authorities could further weaken President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and his efforts to revive the French economy, and could strengthen the far-right National Front, led by Marine Le Pen.Forcing France to prune further also could hurt the economies of its big trading partners, like Germany.Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the normally hard-charging German finance minister and deficit-discipline taskmaster, was among those who suggested on Monday afternoon that priority should be given to avoiding a prolonged confrontation with Paris.\u201cWe will wait until France has presented its budget and structural reforms,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said on his way into the meeting. \u201cThe European rules are there to be stuck to.\u201dBut he added that he was \u201cconfident that a solution can be found in the case of France.\u201dThe pressure is on Paris to make cuts or face censure by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. The penalties could include fines, although no eurozone country has ever been sanctioned for missing its deficit targets \u2014 as even Germany has done in the past.Smaller eurozone members that were forced by the commission and their international lenders during the lengthy sovereign debt crisis to make painful spending cuts to meet budgeting goals want to see the rules applied fairly and equally to large states like France.The European Commission, moreover, does not want to see a rerun of what happened during the middle of the last decade when large countries like Germany flouted the rules, which are meant to ensure that disparate economies can operate on a single currency by having all governments adhere to basic debt and deficit guidelines.Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said after the meeting that he expected plenty of exchanges with European authorities about the French budget during the coming weeks. He hinted that the position of other member countries could evolve as they came to understand the risks created by the current economic situation.\u201cThere will be time for discussion and for thoughts on the situation on the eurozone to ripen,\u201d Mr. Sapin told reporters.Mr. Sapin also said that French members of parliament could introduce changes to the budget during the coming months.If the commission is unhappy with the budget that France submits on Wednesday, officials would have two weeks to ask Paris to submit a new one.If that happened and France failed to make an improved offer, the commission could recommend that member states impose the strongest penalty in the pact \u2014 a fine of up to 0.2 percent of its gross domestic product, in theory as soon as November.But France would still have plenty of room to avoid a fine by making a case that a weak economy, including the threat of deflation, is creating exceptional challenges, and by moving ahead with promised economic reforms.\u201cNo decisions have been taken at this stage,\u201d Jyrki Katainen, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, told a news conference after the meeting. He was referring to whether the commission would accept, or reject, budgets for the 18 euro-area member states required to submit them by Wednesday.\u201cIt\u2019s a purely arithmetic exercise,\u201d said Mr. Katainen, who explained that his department could ask governments for more information during the second half of October to help with the assessment.The meeting in Luxembourg follows a weekend of discussions at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s semiannual meetings in Washington, where much of the concern about the slowing world economy focused on Europe and on the eurozone in particular.After surviving the sovereign debt crisis that began with the revelation of a huge hole in Greek government finances in 2009, the eurozone as recently as late summer had appeared to be on the mend. But France, the currency union\u2019s second largest economy, has failed to grow as hoped, while Italy is still trying to reduce its towering debt and Germany, the bloc\u2019s economic engine, is at risk of stalling.One way out of the impasse might be a bargain in which the German government would pledge to spend more to rejuvenate demand in the eurozone and more widely, while France would do some additional, painful belt-tightening.But Mr. Dijsselbloem, the president of the group of eurozone finance ministers, bluntly stated that France first had to make an offer that would keep it within the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Union agreement mandating that member countries keep their budget deficits to within 3 percent of gross domestic product.The 2015 budget as recently announced by Paris would have a deficit of more than 4 percent next year, and would not meet the 3 percent target before 2017.\u201cNo deals outside the pact,\u201d Mr. Dijsselbloem said on Monday.Advertisement"}

Mr. Viehbacher, a citizen of Canada and Germany, gave the company more of an international outlook. He recruited some new managers, including Elias A. Zerhouni, a former director of National Institutes of Health in the United States, whom he tapped to run research and development.That gave Sanofi a presence in the Boston area, a hot spot for pharmaceutical research because of the universities and biotechnology companies there. He made efforts to shift more of Sanofi\u2019s research there and personally moved to Boston this year.But those actions led to dissatisfaction among labor unions and some government officials in France, who were concerned about a loss of jobs in their country. American depositary receipts of Sanofi fell 6 percent on Wednesday to $45.22 on the New York Stock Exchange. That followed a fall of 9.5 percent on Tuesday, after Mr. Viehbacher warned that growth in the sales of the company\u2019s top-selling drug, the insulin injection Lantus, was faltering because of a price war in the United States. He indicated that overall sales of Sanofi\u2019s diabetes drugs were not expected to grow next year.Timothy Anderson, a pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said Mr. Viehbacher had made the company more global, which was a welcome development. \u201cWhile Sanofi has had its ups and downs,\u201d Mr. Anderson wrote in a note to clients, \u201cthe ups have generally exceeded the downs, and our perception is that Viehbacher has had the support of the investment community more often than not.\u201d Mr. Weinberg, the chairman, told analysts that Sanofi was looking mainly outside the company for its next chief executive, aiming for someone with solid pharmaceutical industry experience, regardless of nationality.The departure of Mr. Viehbacher was not exactly a surprise. Rumors of a shake-up had swirled, and the French business newspaper Les Echos on Monday published a letter that Mr. Viehbacher had sent to the board pleading his case.The hard-charging Mr. Viehbacher joined Sanofi in December 2008, after running the North American operations of GlaxoSmithKline and losing to Andrew Witty in the competition to be Glaxo\u2019s chief executive. With anxiety about France\u2019s economy running high in recent years, Mr. Viehbacher had for some time been a lightning rod for criticism by Sanofi employees in France and some in the government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Mr. Viehbacher\u2019s restructuring efforts brought unwanted attention from the former economy minister Arnaud Montebourg along with a public battle over Sanofi\u2019s plan to close a research site in Toulouse, at the expense of hundreds of jobs. That plan was dropped in 2013.This July, unions were incensed by reports that Mr. Viehbacher was offering a portfolio of 200 older drugs valued at more than $8 billion to investors and competitors, a transaction that, if completed, would have meant the sale of French factories and a possible loss of jobs.Mr. Weinberg said the board\u2019s discussions about replacing Mr. Viehbacher began in midsummer but that it acted this week because newspaper reports about a shake-up were creating uncertainty. He pointed to the loss of competitive edge in the diabetes drug business, recent problems in Brazil and China, and communication problems, noting that the board had learned about Mr. Viehbacher\u2019s plan to sell the drug portfolio from the news media.Mr. Viehbacher said on Wednesday that he was proud of his track record at Sanofi.\u201cWe built Sanofi into a good company. We\u2019ve had good, strong growth in the third quarter and have got a good pipeline,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that I\u2019m leaving the company in better shape than when I arrived.\u201dMr. Viehbacher, 54, said he did not know what he wanted to do next, or whether he would seek another executive role in the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cUp until 24 hours ago,\u201d he said, \u201cI have to say I was working pretty much 24/7. I\u2019m going to have to hit the pause button and think.\u201dDavid Jolly reported from Paris and Andrew Pollack from Los Angeles. Yann Cres contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A World Without OPEC?", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byForty-one years ago this month, the Arab oil embargo began. The countries that were part of it belonged, of course, to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \u2014 OPEC \u2014 which had banded together 13 years earlier to strengthen their ability to negotiate with international oil companies. The embargo led to widespread shortages in the United States, higher prices at the gas pump and long lines at gas stations. By the time it ended, the price of oil had risen to $12 a barrel from $3. \u201cOPEC is not going to survive another 50 years,\u201d Morse told me. \u201cIt probably won\u2019t even survive another 10. It has become extremely difficult for them to forge an agreement.\u201d When Morse and Jaffe wrote their article last year, the price of oil was more than $100 a barrel. Today, the per-barrel price is in the low- to mid-$80s. It has dropped more than 25 percent since June. There was a time when $80 a barrel would have been more than satisfactory for OPEC members, but those days are long gone. Venezuela\u2019s budgetary needs requires that it sell its oil at well above $100 a barrel. The Arab Spring prompted a number of important OPEC members \u2014 including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 to increase budgetary spending to keep their own populations quiescent. According to the International Monetary Fund, the United Arab Emirates needs a price of more than $80 to meet its budgetary obligations. That\u2019s up from less than $25 a barrel in 2008. When I got Jaffe on the phone, I asked her if she thought OPEC was a spent force. \u201cYou can never say never,\u201d she replied, and then laid out a few dire scenarios \u2014 mostly revolving around oil fields being bombed or attacked \u2014 that might make supply scarce again. But barring that, this is a moment we\u2019ve long been waiting for. Thanks to the shale revolution, OPEC has become a paper tiger. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Picks Top Economic Aide, Formerly of I.M.F.", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 India\u2019s government on Thursday appointed the Washington-based development economist Arvind Subramanian as its chief economic adviser.The prominent post has been vacant since Raghuram Rajan left the position last year to become the central bank governor. The delay in filling this and other senior advisory positions after the government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi took over in May was seen as encumbering the announcement of broad-based economic reforms.Speculation has been rife about the appointment of Mr. Subramanian, who was born and received his early education in India, since his candidacy first emerged in August.The appointment of the chief economic adviser comes as the government prepares its first full-year budget, due in February. The adviser is typically responsible for the annual economic survey used in the drafting of the budget, but Mr. Subramanian will have to wait because the survey for this year was released in July. His appointment is for three years.At a news conference in New Delhi, Mr. Subramanian said he would focus on providing equal growth for Indians at all economic levels. \u201cIt is an honor and privilege to serve a government that has a mandate for reform and change,\u201d he said.Mr. Subramanian is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. He previously worked closely with Mr. Rajan when both held positions at the International Monetary Fund; Mr. Subramanian was an assistant director in the research department. He has also worked at the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. He has taught at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.Analysts said Mr. Subramanian\u2019s appointment would bolster the government\u2019s efforts to revive the economy.\u201cIn its first few months in office, the Modi government has been criticized for lacking an overarching vision on the economy,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a research center in Washington. \u201cWhat Arvind brings is not only a brilliant analytical mind but an ability to see and articulate the big reform picture. He is also a fiercely independent thinker, which means that the government will receive unvarnished and unfiltered economic advice.\u201dThe government also announced the appointment of Rajiv Mehrish, a pro-reform government official from the state of Rajasthan, as the economic affairs secretary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tiny Champ Is Watching Talent Soar as Belt Sags", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 PhotosMONACO \u2014 Hekkie Budler cradled his world championship belts lovingly then turned and, without hesitation, made a confession. \u201cThis one,\u201d he said, pointing to a green-toned leather belt, \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually stay up. I have to put it on my shoulder.\u201dBudler shrugged. So it goes for the littlest boxing champion in the world, a battler who has a title belt that falls off his hips like old sweatpants and shoes he bought in the children\u2019s section and a baby face that people often mistake for a teenager\u2019s.But Budler, a sprightly South African, does not mind being small. To the contrary, it means people often underestimate him, whether it was an oversize rugby player in high school who tried to bully him (and got popped) or a boxing fan who thinks the tinier fighters don\u2019t pack any punch. \u201cThere have actually been times I wished I was smaller,\u201d he said.That would be scientifically difficult: Budler, 26, is 5 feet 3 inches and about 100 pounds. His lean, spindly physique might seem a better fit in an eighth-grade dodgeball game than here, on the French Riviera, where on Saturday Budler will walk to a raised ring in front of a well-heeled crowd and perhaps throw upward of 1,000 punches at his opponent, Xiong Zhao Zhong, a Chinese fighter known as the Mini Mike Tyson. Yet here Budler is, preparing to defend the two belts he holds in the minimumweight division, the lightest sanctioned classification in boxing, and one that limits fighters to weights of no more than 105 pounds. (The belt from the International Boxing Organization is the one that sags off Budler\u2019s 28-inch waist; he also holds a better-fitting one from the World Boxing Council.)Lower-weight boxing is an acquired taste. If the stereotypical match is between two big-boned palookas throwing haymakers like a couple of trucks slamming into each other, a minimumweight fight is, Budler says, \u201clike two speeding bullets coming together.\u201d He then revised his description: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s more like two woodpeckers banging on a piece of wood, over and over and over again.\u201dThe little guys, as Budler\u2019s trainer, Colin Nathan, calls them, have not often captivated the sports world the way bigger boxers have, though loyalists believe there may be a bit of an opening. For years, heavyweights were the stars, but a drop-off in competition during the era when the Klitschko brothers \u2014 Vitali and Wladimir \u2014 were boringly dominant opened up the landscape to smaller fighters. Now, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao, two fighters who have moved up and down in the central weight classes, are the sport\u2019s biggest names. Budler is far from their level and size. But that does not mean he is not powerful. Among the reasons that Budler, who is nicknamed the Hexecutioner, has shot to relative fame in South Africa is because he has won a lot \u2014 he is 26-1 with nine knockouts \u2014 and because he has the ability to deliver devastating punches, which is not necessarily the norm in his division. \u201cA lot of these guys are volume punchers,\u201d Nathan said. He then referred to Budler\u2019s favored left hook. \u201cHekkie\u2019s punches do damage,\u201d he said.This much quickly becomes clear during Budler\u2019s training sessions. One day this week, he and Ryno Liebenberg, a light heavyweight trained by Nathan who will also fight on Saturday\u2019s card, went through an afternoon workout together. The conditions were not ideal. There had been a miscommunication with the local boxing gym, so Budler and Liebenberg skipped rope in the dank stairwell of their hotel and then moved into a hastily arranged conference room where one of them bounced and did aerobic work in a corner while across the room the other threw punches at Nathan, who was wearing mitts and a protective suit around his torso.Liebenberg is big and sturdy, so his shots made predictably loud thwaps when they landed. When it was Budler\u2019s turn, he stepped in, clad in a tracksuit with a plastic sauna suit beneath to help him sweat, and began languidly, dancing around and talking strategy with Nathan before firing off punches that, suddenly, landed with the echo of a jackhammer. Bernie Pailman, who works in Budler\u2019s corner, smiled at the staccato soundtrack. \u201cHe may be little, but he hits big,\u201d Pailman said.Budler did not take a sip of water during the hour-plus workout \u2014 he also eats only twice a day, to help maintain his weight \u2014 but smiled for much of it, clearly enjoying himself despite the Spartan surroundings. While big-name fighters may earn millions for a bout, the most Budler has made for a fight is about $50,000, Nathan said. A lavish lifestyle is not what Budler is about. Budler, Nathan and the rest of Budler\u2019s team arrived here from South Africa on Sunday, stopping for a long layover in Dubai. They flew economy class \u2014 \u201cHekkie doesn\u2019t have problems with leg room,\u201d one member of his team joked \u2014 and chuckled when a passer-by, upon realizing he had bumped into a boxing entourage, assumed that Caz Abrahams, Budler\u2019s tall and well-built strength and conditioning coach, was the champion in the group. \u201cThat happens a lot,\u201d Abrahams said.Obviously Budler hopes to fight for bigger paydays as his career progresses, particularly because he is set to be married next weekend. (His fianc\u00e9e has no problem if he has a black eye in their wedding photographs, he said.) But he said that money had never been his motivator, and that he had plans to go into real estate management whenever his fighting days end.For now, though, he is enjoying himself. He gravitated to boxing when he was 8, sent to the gym by his mother after he played (and lost) a rugby match and promptly blamed everyone on the team but himself. Boxing, his family reasoned, was a sport where he would learn to take responsibility.It stuck. A few years later, in his first youth bout in a ring, Budler knocked down his opponent five times in three rounds; he told his parents afterward that he \u201cgot tired of the guy getting up.\u201d His desire to put people on the mat has not waned. It does not matter that he has two iguanas, Lou and Lula, who are longer than he is tall (they live in his backyard). It does not matter that his boxing boots are size 6. It does not matter that the two teenagers who stopped him for a picture in the hotel lobby this week both towered over him.\u201cAll I ever wanted was to be a professional boxer,\u201d Budler said. \u201cNow I want to be the best in the world, whatever my size.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Making the rich pay the same tax rates on their investment income that the rest of us pay on our earnings would be a good start.And why not close loopholes that allow corporations like General Electric and Boeing to go years without paying practically anything in corporate income taxes?Ending misguided and wasteful tax breaks to fund public investments in transportation, health, education and nutrition would reduce inequality by providing the productive work force and infrastructure to grow our economy for everyone.To the Editor:Edward D. Kleinbard declares that \u201cwhat we should care about\u201d is whether a fiscal system enhances \u201cthe lives of average citizens.\u201d Many of us are less concerned about the average citizen than about the citizens at the bottom of the economic spectrum.I\u2019d rather ensure that those at the lowest end of the economic spectrum have a decent quality of life. Once that point is reached, I don\u2019t object to others\u2019 doing better.To the Editor:Ah, a poignant plea from Edward D. Kleinbard to give the rich more money. After all, the American tax system is \u201cthe most progressive in the developed world.\u201dIf the American system of wealth distribution is so great in comparison with that of other developed countries, why doesn\u2019t it create competitive social consequences?By almost any measure \u2014 cost of health care, cost of education, percentage below the poverty line, high school math scores, people in prison, homicides, drug use and perceived happiness, to name just a few \u2014 the United States lags behind other developed countries. The writer is a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin.To the Editor:Edward D. Kleinbard writes: \u201cThe benefits from unallocated spending are broadly shared. A chief executive who earns 200 times as much as her typical employee does not get 200 times the benefit from our investments in highways.\u201dIf these people drove a hundred miles in their cars, they would gain the same benefits. But consider that the high earner benefits from the infrastructure far more if her company derives revenue that depends on transportation or she profits from investments in companies that take advantage of such government investments.To the Editor:Edward D. Kleinbard is correct on the need for more overall revenue from a wide range of taxpayers. But it is not true that the American tax system is \u201cquite progressive.\u201d A 2011 analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice showed that if all taxes are considered, the total taxes paid by the richest 1 percent (21.5 percent) differs little from their share of total income (20.3 percent).This is also true for the middle quintile, which pulls in 11.6 percent of income and pays 10.3 percent of overall taxes.The rich are probably not paying much more at all, considering their superior ability to conceal income, and a slightly larger contribution is certainly in order.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nelson Bunker Hunt, 88, Oil Tycoon With a Texas-Size Presence, Dies", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNelson Bunker Hunt, the down-home Texas oil tycoon who owned a thousand race horses, drove an old Cadillac and once tried to corner the world\u2019s silver market only to lose most of his fortune when the price collapsed, died on Tuesday in Dallas. He was 88.\u201cA billion dollars ain\u2019t what it used to be,\u201d he said in 1980 after silver stakes he had amassed with two brothers, Herbert and Lamar, fell to $10.80 from $50.35 an ounce. In barely two months, their holdings and contracts for purchases \u2014 corralling a third to half the world\u2019s deliverable silver \u2014 had plunged from a $7 billion value in January to a $1.7 billion loss in March.With the Hunts unable to cover enormous margin calls, the debacle endangered financial markets and brokerage houses, forcing federal regulators and the nation\u2019s banks to step in with a $1 billion line of credit, a bailout that saved the system from a stampede and the Hunts from a meltdown.But for Bunker Hunt, who used his middle name, and his brothers \u2014 scions of one of the world\u2019s richest clans \u2014 the boom and bust led to years of lawsuits, civil charges, fines, damage claims and bankruptcy proceedings that gobbled up vast holdings in real estate, oil, gas, cattle, coal, thoroughbred stables and other assets. Still, they managed to salvage millions and were not subjected to criminal charges.Countless others were affected \u2014 speculators who bought bullion and futures contracts and could not get out in time to avoid heavy losses and ordinary people who sold silverware, jewelry and candlesticks to cash in on soaring silver prices. New rules limiting trades had been imposed, and the glut of silver on the open market intensified the panic that led to the price collapse.Bunker Hunt was a jovial 275-pound eccentric who looked a bit like the actor Burl Ives. In the 1960s and \u201970s he was one of the world\u2019s richest men, worth up to $16 billion by some estimates. With his five siblings, heirs of the oil billionaire H. L. Hunt, who sired 15 children by three women and died in 1974, he controlled a staggering family fortune whose value was not publicly reported.In his heyday, Bunker Hunt owned five million acres of grazing land in Australia, 1,000 thoroughbreds on farms from Ireland to New Zealand, eight million acres of oil fields in Libya, offshore wells in the Philippines and Mexico, and an empire of skyscrapers, cattle ranches, mining interests and other holdings. Home was a French provincial mansion in a Dallas suburb and his 2,000-acre Circle T Ranch 30 miles out of town.Often likened to Jett Rink, the antihero of Edna Ferber\u2019s \u201cGiant,\u201d or the scheming J. R. Ewing of the long-running CBS television drama \u201cDallas,\u201d he was a nonsmoking teetotaler who cultivated a devil-may-care Texas mystique by inhabiting cheap suits, a battered Cadillac, economy-class airline seats, burger and chili joints, and dusty barnyards in the raucous company of ranch hands.He was an evangelical Christian close to the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson and supported right-wing politicians and causes, including the John Birch Society. He loathed the federal government, warned of international communist conspiracies, spouted anti-Semitic sentiments, did business with the Saudi royal family and bankrolled expeditions to salvage the Titanic and to find Noah\u2019s Ark.After being pummeled by the silver debacle and further losses in oil and real estate, Mr. Hunt and his brothers took out loans to pay debts, then sold properties to repay the loans and placed many family holdings into bankruptcy, including the Placid Oil Company, the crown jewel of the Hunt financial empire. It was eventually sold, along with the homes, land, stables, art and coin collections, and other treasures.In one lawsuit, a federal jury in Manhattan determined in 1988 that the Hunts had conspired with others in a racketeering enterprise to monopolize the silver market and ordered them to pay $130 million in damages to a Peruvian commodities concern. Bunker and Herbert were found most culpable, while Lamar, the owner of the Kansas City Chiefs football team, was assigned a lesser role.As creditors closed in, the Hunts hemorrhaged money and defaulted on $1.5 billion in loans. They agreed to pay $90 million in back taxes over 15 years and $10 million each in fines levied by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which barred them from trading. In 1989, Bunker emerged from bankruptcy with assets of $5 million to $10 million and debts that stretched to the Pecos horizon.But through the clever use of courts and trusts to protect assets, and of counterclaims and settlements to gain time and ease the pain, the Hunts for years carried on much as usual: Bunker exploring for oil abroad, attending the races and overseeing smaller thoroughbred stables; Herbert running real estate operations; Lamar focusing on his sports enterprises.Like his siblings, Bunker still had millions in trusts set up by his father, and Forbes reported in 2001 that, while he had long ago dropped off the list of the richest Americans, he had recently bought 80 racehorses for $2.5 million, and that a filly called Hattiesburg, which he picked up for $20,000, had won $357,000.\u201cI don\u2019t really know anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI am just trying to win a few races.\u201dNelson Bunker Hunt was born in El Dorado, Ark., on Feb. 22, 1926, one of seven children of Haroldson Lafayette Hunt Jr. and Lyda Bunker Hunt. One girl died in infancy. H. L. Hunt had already struck oil riches, and by 1935 trust funds had been set up for Bunker; two sisters, Margaret and Caroline, and three brothers, William Herbert, Lamar and Haroldson III, who was known as Hassie and was incapacitated with mental illness.It was not until years later that they discovered that their father had two other families: four children each with Ruth Ray and Frania Tye. In the ensuing internecine intrigues, all were given trust funds and some became beneficiaries of the patriarch\u2019s will.When Bunker was 12, his family moved to Dallas. He attended the University of Texas, joined the Navy in World War II and, after being discharged, attended Southern Methodist University. He worked with his father and brothers in the oil business for a time, then began his own ventures in cattle, horses and oil. He made $5 billion in Libya before Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi nationalized the oil fields.As oil prices rose in the 1970s, the family\u2019s wealth skyrocketed \u2014 as did inflation. The Hunts insisted that their pursuit of silver had merely been a hedge against inflation. Much of the hoard was bought on margin or financed with borrowed money.By mid-January 1980 they owned or controlled such vast quantities of silver that they were reaping $100 million in paper profit with every $1 increase in the price.Then the bubble burst.After the market had collapsed and the family had been forced to put up billions in collateral, the oldest sister, Margaret, a dominant voice in family councils, confronted Bunker, demanding to know what he had intended to accomplish.\u201cI was just trying to make some money,\u201d he replied.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quantitative Easing Is Ending. Here\u2019s What It Did, in Charts.", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyThe era of quantitative easing is over, for now, and in the United States, at least. But the consequences of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy to pump trillions of dollars into the financial system in hopes of stimulating the economy will long be with us.The program has managed a rare trick of being perpetually maligned on Wall Street while driving asset prices up enough to make lots of people on Wall Street very wealthy. But what do we know about these three programs that eased monetary policy through unconventional means?The Fed faces a paradox. Its goals are all related to the real economy. It is charged by law with maintaining stable prices and maximum employment. But its tools work through financial markets, principally buying and selling bonds.So while the Fed\u2019s impact on financial markets can be dramatic and easy to measure, its impact on the economy, which is the real goal, can be much squishier. Still, here\u2019s what we know about the successes (and failures) of more than five years of Q.E.What exactly is Q.E., anyway?One chart shows its essence: the line showing the total size of the central bank\u2019s balance sheet. For years, it bounced along at a nearly constant level, until the 2008 financial crisis, when the Fed began using its power to create money, first to respond to the crisis, and when the intense phase of the crisis had passed, to try to boost an economy that kept underperforming.And it\u2019s not going anywhere anytime soon, by the way. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, has indicated that the Fed will keep its large balance sheet in place for some time. When it is time to tighten the money supply, it will start by raising short-term interest rates, not by selling off some of the assets it has acquired.Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the Fed who engineered all three rounds of the program, drew a distinction between what he called \u201ccredit easing,\u201d or pushing money into specific lending markets that had broken down, and \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d or increasing the money supply generally.One simple way of looking at the distinction is by following the trend in what the Fed bought. Traditionally, the Fed has held almost entirely United States government bonds, buying and selling them to adjust the money supply. The idea is that they are a neutral asset, the bedrock from which other interest rates through the economy are set.But during the first and third rounds of Q.E., the Fed has bought vast sums of mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored firms like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, instead of just Treasuries.The idea has been to try to channel money directly toward the troubled housing market; a flood of Fed money into mortgages has contributed to lowering the premium that Americans must pay to borrow money to buy a house. If you are looking to buy a house and are surprised to learn you can get a mortgage at a rate not much higher than what the federal government pays to borrow money (that is, very low), it is reasonable to thank Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen.The practice remains controversial within the Fed, as it comes awfully close to picking winners and losers in the economy \u2014 in this case, favoring housing over other forms of investment.What it has meant for marketsWhen the Fed took trillions in government bonds and mortgage securities off the market, the investors who would have bought them had to find something else to buy. Often the answer was corporate bonds. With the increased demand, prices of those bonds went up and the interest rate that large companies must pay to borrow money on the bond market fell. That made the environment more favorable for companies looking to expand or refinance old debts.So both consumer and business borrowing costs fell sharply over the time the Fed\u2019s money-creation was at full throttle.Consider one common measure of the stock market, valuations, as tracked by Yale University\u2019s Robert Shiller. It compares the valuation of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index with the inflation-adjusted earnings of companies over the preceding decade. The idea is to filter out cyclical ups and downs and assess whether stocks are expensive or cheap relative to their long-term averages.In other words, there is a risk that, aided by Q.E., financial markets have come back a bit too far, too fast, especially when compared with fundamentals like the amount of money companies are making.What about inflation?One of the most urgent reasons for the program was the fear of deflation \u2014 that, as happened in the 1930s, once prices started falling, it could become a dangerous vicious cycle that would leave millions unemployed. In early 2009, prices, especially for commodities, were in free fall.This much can be said for Q.E.: It helped arrest that vicious cycle. By late 2009, both the actual rate of inflation and investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation were rising back toward the 2 percent the Fed aims for. The second round, announced in late 2010, helped guide them up further.But even with the trillions of dollars pumped into the economy, the Fed has been perpetually unable to get inflation up to the 2 percent level it aims for, except for the occasional brief period. There is good news in that predictions by many Fed critics that Q.E. would unleash vicious hyperinflation have come nowhere close to materializing. But neither has it been enough for the Fed to reach its self-imposed goal.In an economy trying to get out from under an overhang of debt, where excessive unemployment is the leading problem, too-low inflation can be deeply problematic and hold back growth. Q.E. has not been powerful enough to generate as much inflation as the Fed says it wants.Where\u2019s the growth?The good news is that the economy has been growing remarkably steadily since the middle of 2009. There were several moments when pundits warned that a dip back into recession was looming, but none materialized. Fed policy is quite possibly a reason for that; every time a risk of recession seemed to pick up, Mr. Bernanke & Co. cooked up another round of Q.E. that helped avert it.Still, the pace of growth has been perpetually disappointing for anyone expecting or betting on a return to the pre-crisis trend.Compared with the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate of \u201cpotential G.D.P.\u201d \u2014 the level of output the economy would have if we were at full employment and our factories were cranking at full throttle \u2014 we\u2019re still hundreds of billions of dollars short.The Q.E.-driven recovery has been solid and consistent \u2014 but has not been able to push the economy toward a sharp rebound.The job market tells a similar tale. The third round of Q.E., launched in September 2012, was explicitly targeted at the job market, and was accompanied by an open-ended promise to continue until there was \u201csubstantial progress\u201d toward improving the jobs situation. So what has happened?There really has been improvement in the rate of job creation. After bouncing along at adding around two million private sector jobs a year in the early years of the recovery, the economy is now accelerating toward the 2.5 million range. Some further acceleration would be welcomed by the jobless, but it seems that the Q.E.-driven recovery is now creating at least somewhat faster job growth.The impact on jobs is a metaphor for the impact of Q.E. more broadly. It helped the economy recover. But it wasn\u2019t fast and it didn\u2019t solve every problem.Advertisement"}

He knew there had been chatter for years that the town\u2019s growth might be diluting its Western friendliness. Was this a sign?Mr. Kern did not panic. Annual growth in sales tax collection \u2014 one measure of business health \u2014 was up about 7 percent in 2013, putting it ahead of other local resorts like Aspen and Crested Butte, but behind Vail and Telluride. But competition among resorts is brutal, and Mr. Kern concluded that Steamboat Springs had to differentiate itself. \u201cAnybody who comes to the West can go mountain biking or road biking or hiking in Telluride or Aspen or wherever,\u201d he said.With this success, the emphasis on connecting with customers spread around the resort, and soon people in town began to notice a difference. Even the notoriously cranky lift operators began to ask skiers their name and how they were doing in their few seconds together. \u201cIt was like they hired a bunch of grumpy old men to manage that position,\u201d said Rex Brice, who owns five restaurants in town. \u201cNow it\u2019s like the same old men, but they\u2019re friendly.\u201dMr. Kern called Mr. Eppley and asked him to prepare a training program for two pilot groups of restaurateurs, small-business owners, and municipal employees. Mr. Eppley agreed to give the training at a steep discount. And over four four-hour sessions spread over a month last spring, he briefed the 25 students in current customer-service thinking. Pointing to Disney as an example of excellence, he talked about going the extra mile, for example, by walking a lost visitor to a location instead of just pointing in the right direction.Mr. Eppley then taught something he calls \u201cthe connection stack,\u201d a system meant to help employees find common ground with customers. In this system, employees choose from pictogram cards that ask five questions: Where are you from? What do you do? Where did you go to school? Where do you travel? What are your hobbies?The idea is to improve the customer\u2019s experience \u2014 and encourage loyalty \u2014 by teaching workers how to form a warm connection with clients and use the knowledge they glean from this connection. \u201cWe teach people how to have that proper conversation with a guest or client,\u201d said Mr. Eppley, who then described an ideal interaction at a hardware store. \u201cYou talk me through a project,\u201d he said, \u201cand in the process maybe you find out that I have two kids and we both like golf. And you\u2019re calling me by name.\u201dAfter learning the system, however, the pilot students returned to their businesses and repeated the training for their employees. And those employees took it to the front lines, where some say they found the connection stack was an easy way to get closer to customers. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. It\u2019s more like socializing than work,\u201d said Bethany Clendennen, 27, a bartender at McKnights. \u201cWe find that people are a lot happier in this atmosphere. I\u2019ve seen a big difference in tips, and in myself, too. You can use it to meet people.\u201d\u201cDisney takes a long time to hire people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do testing, they look at values \u2014 because it\u2019s hard to keep that smiling face and be genuine if that\u2019s not who you are.\u201dIt is a point Mr. Eppley drove home when he told the restaurateurs they should always ask potential hires, point-blank, \u201cAre you friendly?\u201dUltimately, the Steamboat Springs\u2019 initiative will be judged on whether it creates more loyal guests and increases business. The town\u2019s hotels had 12 percent more guests this summer, and Ms. Landers said Creekside Caf\u00e9\u2019s business was up 15 percent \u2014 though it is impossible to know if the increases were caused by the training or by the improved economy. At McKnights, Mr. Shea said credit-card tips are up 2 percent since the training.The most recent customer service survey, however, was inconclusive. The portion of visitors giving the friendliness of the town\u2019s people a perfect 10 points rose to 53 percent from 47 percent in 2013. But in the latest Net Promoter Score survey, the town\u2019s score slipped further to 67.Mr. Kern, who resigned from the Steamboat Chamber in September to take care of his aging parents in Michigan, said it was too early to draw conclusions. The town plans to continue training restaurant workers and expand into the retail sector in 2015.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Crony Communism in China", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCLAREMONT, Calif. \u2014 When Xi Jinping launched his anti-corruption campaign shortly after becoming the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in late 2012, most observers thought he would merely go through the motions, jailing a few senior officials and then carrying on business as usual. His predecessors, after all, had used anti-corruption investigations largely to eliminate their political opponents and consolidate power. Disciplinary actions would spike during the year following a new leader\u2019s appointment and fall the year after that. But Mr. Xi\u2019s campaign goes well beyond any immediate desire to establish his political supremacy. It is unprecedented in sweep and ambition, taking on the class of 5,000 or so very senior officials who operate the most vital organs of the C.C.P., the government, the military and state-owned enterprises. Its goal is no less than to upend the unspoken system by which China\u2019s elites have been governing since the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989: a self-reinforcing web of relations based on patronage and corruption. As a leader driven by a historic mission to safeguard the C.C.P.\u2019s rule against all odds, Mr. Xi sees endemic corruption as a serious threat to the regime\u2019s long-term survival.But corruption has penetrated so very deeply into the party-state that it has become the glue that holds it together. And so Mr. Xi\u2019s campaign, which is meant to ensure the C.C.P.\u2019s longevity, seems to pose an existential threat to it in the short or medium term. Reliable data measuring corruption are scarce, yet several indicators, including the sums pilfered by officials, support the consensus among China watchers that corruption has increased significantly in the last two decades. According to corruption cases reported in the most authoritative official media, the median amount of bribes rose from just over $91,000 in 2000 to $225,000 in 2009, a 100 percent increase (after adjusting for inflation). Unscrupulous officials have been stealing more since the early 1990s thanks partly to a large increase in infrastructure spending. Lucrative contracts for roads, ports and railways are opportunities for them to enrich themselves or their cronies. Investment in infrastructure, real estate and other fixed assets rose from an average of 36 percent of G.D.P. during 1980-1991 to more than 41 percent during 1992-2011. Based on the data for 2011, investment in infrastructure accounts for about one-third of total fixed-asset investment. Sixteen heads of transportation departments in 11 provinces have received severe punishment (one was executed) for corruption in the last two decades. Last year, China\u2019s longtime railway minister, Liu Zhijun, was given a suspended death sentence for accepting more than $10 million in bribes.Another source of windfall profit has been privatization \u2014 which is euphemistically called \u201cproperty rights reform,\u201d because of a lingering ideological squeamishness about turning nominally state-owned assets into private property. Since the early 1990s, the Chinese government has progressively relaxed its control over the disposal of land and mining resources, for example, allowing local officials unprecedented freedom to transfer these valuable assets to family members and friends. In a major scandal involving Zhou Yongkang, the recently retired internal security czar, his elder son purchased two oil blocks from the state-owned energy giant China National Petroleum Corporation for about $3.2 million and quickly resold them for a profit of more than $80 million. Cao Yongzheng, a crony of Mr. Zhou\u2019s who claims to be able to predict the future, seems to have been given, most likely as a reward for some services, an oil block that brought him nearly $100 million a year, according to an investigation by the highly respected Chinese business publication Caixin. Based on reports from the offices of provincial and municipal prosecutors, between one-third and two-thirds of all corruption cases in China today involve multiple officials and businessmen. In the 1980s, most corruption was committed by individuals acting alone. This newer, collusive form of corruption is far more pernicious because it is harder to detect and to stop, and it corrodes the institutional integrity of the state. It also threatens the party\u2019s control over local elites: Colluding officials typically promote and protect each other in a tight patronage network. In the city of Maoming, in Guangdong Province, more than 240 local officials, including three consecutive party chiefs, the executive vice mayor, the municipal police chief, the anti-corruption chief and many heads of the city\u2019s agencies, were implicated in a corruption scandal in 2009-2012. In an unfolding mega-scandal in the coal-rich province of Shanxi, four of the area\u2019s 13 most senior officials have been detained for \u201cserious violations of discipline and the law,\u201d a.k.a. graft, including the province\u2019s anti-corruption chief himself. Such endemic corruption has fortuitously created a rare opportunity for Mr. Xi to make an immediate mark after rising to the top. Fighting corruption is now one of the three pillars of his domestic strategy, along with economic reform and the containment of pro-democracy forces. This war serves several objectives for him. As ever, it can help remove rivals and reimpose discipline on a ruling party that has become too soft. It can also intimidate a reluctant bureaucracy to carry out economic reforms that might undercut its power and privileges. And it can help Mr. Xi win popular support by going some ways toward repairing the C.C.P.\u2019s tarnished image as a decadent regime out of touch with the masses.To drive this message home, Mr. Xi is pursuing a multipronged approach. Its most potent component is the investigation and prosecution of a very large number of senior officials, who once enjoyed de facto immunity. In the last 23 months, 50 so-called tigers or senior officials with vice ministerial ranks and above have fallen into Mr. Xi\u2019s dragnet, compared with only 30 in the five years prior to his appointment as C.C.P. chief. Mr. Xi\u2019s hunt has captured some supersized cats, including Mr. Zhou, who in addition to being the internal security czar was also a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party\u2019s top decision-making body. Another unprecedented move was the prosecution of the top general Xu Caihou, a newly retired vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and a former Politburo member. The clean-up campaign has introduced procedural changes that make it much harder for local elites to cover up corruption. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party\u2019s internal anti-corruption agency \u2014 which is headed by Mr. Xi\u2019s ally, Wang Qishan \u2014 increasingly relies on special inspection teams to ferret out corrupt officials in the provinces through extended confidential interviews and investigations. Local anti-corruption agencies must now report the results of any investigation they conduct to a higher-level anti-corruption agency. Mr. Xi\u2019s campaign also imposes austerity measures, eliminating many of the lavish perks China\u2019s ruling elites have come to take for granted. New regulations prohibit officials from accepting extravagant gifts, entertainment and travel accommodations. The result has been a steep fall in the sale of French Cognac and Swiss watches, as well as widespread resentment among officials. Comprehensive and bold, Mr. Xi\u2019s strategy is risky precisely because it is needed: Corruption permeates the institutional fabric of China\u2019s party-state; it is the proverbial grease that oils the vast Chinese bureaucracy. After Tiananmen and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the C.C.P. was left with little ideological appeal, and as a survival strategy, it began rewarding loyalists with lucrative positions, securing their support with material benefits. This made good political sense, but the C.C.P. did too little to limit the leeway of its minions, and they soon developed a sense of entitlement. They also began to follow a new modus vivendi, with officials at all levels trading favors to resolve their differences over personnel matters or the distribution of economic spoils. They maintained stability and cohesion within their ranks by way of oligarchic horse-trading.But now Mr. Xi\u2019s war on corruption is challenging this post-Tiananmen elite bargain. By imposing austerity measures and penalties for corruption on the bureaucracy of the Chinese party-state, Mr. Xi risks alienating, even antagonizing, the country\u2019s most powerful political force.At the moment, Mr. Xi has the public\u2019s support and political momentum, and the bureaucracy is smart enough not to push back. Most of the battle-tested apparatchiks are feigning compliance and hunkering down. Some local officials are deliberately slowing down the pace of their work \u2014 like approving projects or executing routine administrative tasks \u2014 apparently to pressure him into ending or softening his anti-corruption campaign. If the economy flags, their calculation seems to be, Mr. Xi will have to shift his attention to reviving growth, a pillar of the party\u2019s legitimacy.Defeating such passive resistance may require Mr. Xi to adapt his strategy. So far, he has relied on his control of the military to deter any challenge. But he will need to broaden his base of support, both inside the C.C.P. and in Chinese society. That means quickly promoting reformers within the party to positions of power and granting more autonomy to the judiciary to prosecute corrupt officials. It may also mean something more radical: allowing the media and civil society to act as citizen watchdogs, even though so far the Xi administration has seemed intent on curtailing those groups\u2019 freedoms. Whether or not Mr. Xi modifies his approach to fighting corruption, it is clear he has already changed the rules of the game in China, particularly within the Communist Party. Less clear is whether the importance of prestige will turn out to be a stronger glue for the party than the bonds of venality that have been holding it together to date. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for Low Ideals", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet\u2019s say you came of political age during Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. Maybe you were swept up in the idealism. But now you\u2019ve seen an election driven by hope give way to an election driven by fear. Partisans are afraid the other side might win. Candidates are pawns of the consultants because they\u2019re afraid of themselves. Everybody\u2019s afraid of the Ebola virus, ISIS and the fragile economy.The politics of the last few years have made you disappointed, disillusioned and cynical. You look back at your earlier idealism as cotton candy.Well, I\u2019m here to make the case for political idealism.I\u2019m not making the case for the high idealism that surrounded that 2008 campaign. It was based on the idea that people are basically innocent and differences can be quickly transcended. It was based on the idea that society is easily malleable and it\u2019s possible to have quick transformational change. It was based in the idea of a heroic savior (remember those \u201cHope\u201d posters).I\u2019m here to make the case for low idealism. The low idealist rejects the politics of innocence. The low idealist recoils from any movement that promises \u201cnew beginnings,\u201d tries to offer transcendent \u201cbliss to be alive\u201d moments or tries to fill people\u2019s spiritual voids.Low idealism begins with a sturdy and accurate view of human nature. We\u2019re all a bit self-centered, self-interested and inclined to think we are nobler than we are. Montaigne wrote, \u201cIf others examined themselves attentively, as I do, they would find themselves, as I do, full of inanity and nonsense. Get rid of it I cannot without getting rid of myself.\u201dLow idealism continues with a realistic view of politics. Politics is slow drilling through hard boards. It is a series of messy compromises. The core functions of government are negative \u2014 putting out fires, arresting criminals, settling disputes \u2014 and much of what government does is the unromantic work of preventing bad situations from getting worse.Politicians operate in a recalcitrant medium with incomplete information, bad options and no sleep. Government in good times is merely dull; when it is enthralling, times are usually bad.So low idealism starts with a tone of sympathy. Anybody who works in this realm deserves compassion and gentle regard. The low idealist knows that rallies with anthems and roaring are just make-believe, but has warm affection for any politician who exhibits neighborliness, courtesy and the ability to listen. The low idealist understands that those who try to rise above the messy business of deal-making often turn into zealots and wind up sinking below it. On the other hand, this kind of idealist has a full heart for those who serve the practical work of legislating: James Baker and Ted Kennedy in the old days; Bob Corker and Ron Wyden today. Believing experience is the best mode of education, he favors the competent old hand to the na\u00efve outsider.The low idealist is more romantic about the past than about the future. Though governing is hard, there are some miracles of human creation that have been handed down to us. These include, first and foremost, the American Constitution, but also the institutions that function pretty well, like the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve. Her first job is to work with existing materials, magnify what\u2019s best and incrementally reform what is worst.The businessman might be enamored of disruptive change, but the low idealist abhors it in politics. The low idealist liked Obama\u2019s vow to hit foreign policy singles and doubles day by day, so long as there is a large vision to give long-term direction.The low idealist admires a different kind of leader; not the martyr or the passionate crusader or the righteous populist. He likes the resilient one, who maybe has been tainted by scandals and has learned from his self-inflicted wounds that his own worst enemy is himself.He likes the person who speaks only after paying minute attention to the way things really are, and whose proposals are grounded in the low stability of the truth.The low idealist lives most of her life at a deeper dimension than the realm of the political. She believes, as Samuel Johnson put it, that \u201cThe happiness of society depends on virtue\u201d \u2014 not primarily material conditions. But, and this is what makes her an idealist, she believes that better laws can nurture virtue. Statecraft is soulcraft. Good tax policies can arouse energy and enterprise. Good social programs can encourage compassion and community service.Low idealism starts with a warts-and-all mentality, but holds that people can be improved by their political relationships, so it ends up with something loftier and more inspiring than those faux idealists who think human beings are not a problem and politics is mostly a matter of moving money around.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Insistence on Austerity Meets With Revolt in the Eurozone", "Date": "2014-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 As Europe confronts new signs of economic trouble, national leaders, policy makers and economists are starting to challenge as never before the guiding principle of the Continent\u2019s response to six years of crisis: Germany\u2019s insistence on budget austerity as a precondition to healthy growth.France this week stepped up what has become an open revolt by some of the eurozone\u2019s bigger economies against Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s continued demands for deficit reduction in the face of slowing growth. Italy has warned against too rigidly following Germany\u2019s preferred approach. Even the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, is pushing for Germany to loosen up.The disagreement looms over European Union leaders as they meet at least three times this month, starting on Wednesday in Milan with discussion of high unemployment, particularly among the young, and the question of how to get Europe\u2019s economies moving again.The rapidly evolving debate holds the potential to be a turning point after a long period in which Germany and Ms. Merkel have dominated European economic policy. On Tuesday, new signs emerged that Germany, the traditional growth engine of the eurozone, was on the verge of an economic downturn.\u201cAfter going along with the damaging strategy of austerity in the hopes that Germany would eventually moderate its position, countries are now saying, \u2018Enough is enough. We\u2019re going to have to act to arrest the downward spiral in the economy,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Simon Tilford, the deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London.In another warning sign, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its forecast for growth in the 18-nation eurozone this year yet again, to just 0.8 percent from a 1.1 percent outlook six months ago, and cautioned that the region might slide back into its third recession in five years. The fund urged Germany in particular to ramp up spending to stimulate the economy.Eurozone countries are \u201cstuck\u201d in low growth, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., said in an interview. \u201cThat is clearly weighing on their perspectives going forward.\u201dWhile still a firmly popular leader in her ninth year in power, Ms. Merkel is also under fire at home. In a new book, \u201cThe Germany Illusion,\u201d one of the country\u2019s leading economists, Marcel Fratzscher, takes the government to task for declining to invest in infrastructure and failing to encourage private investment or foster a modern service sector that would yield better pay and thus fuel higher consumer spending. He also criticizes large German companies for directing ever more of their investment to Eastern Europe, Asia and the United States, rather than to the eurozone.There are no signs so far that Ms. Merkel or German companies are likely to yield. The steps being sought by France and other advocates of change remain relatively modest \u2014 in essence, just slowing the pace at which they cut their budget deficits. A number of European nations, like Finland, are strong backers of austerity. And for all their summit meetings, European leaders have no big new plans for restoring growth, like the stimulus legislation passed in the United States in 2009 that is credited with helping to keep the recession from being deeper and longer.Still, the combination of political pressure from both the left and right across Europe, and signs of continued economic erosion, have created a climate in which other countries feel emboldened to challenge Ms. Merkel \u2014 starting with France, long Germany\u2019s closest partner in European affairs and a linchpin of the single currency.Critics of austerity say that more government spending would increase demand for goods and services in Europe and help avert a dangerous fall into deflation, a downward spiral in wages and prices that can cripple an economy for years. Proponents of austerity say that governments that fail to get their budget deficits and accumulated debt under control risk losing the ability to borrow at affordable rates in the bond markets and sowing the seeds of financial instability.Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France has intensified a showdown with Germany and Brussels in recent days, unveiling a \u201cno-austerity budget\u201d designed to cut the deficit more slowly than austerity advocates would like. During a trip to London on Monday to visit with Prime Minister David Cameron, Mr. Valls reiterated France\u2019s defiance, saying the government would mend its finances \u201cat our speed while not losing sight of our priorities.\u201dAs Italy, the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy, has stumbled back into recession, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has admonished Berlin not to threaten its partners and turned up warnings that Germany\u2019s austerity prescription might threaten political instability by stoking the appeal of populist and far-right politicians should economies worsen.At least for the moment, Berlin appears unwilling to deviate from its plan. In the German view, Wednesday\u2019s meeting is about unemployment, and any discussion of budget deficits can wait as scheduled for late October, when a new European Commission \u2014 the E.U.\u2019s administration \u2014 is supposed to be in place. \u201cI do not need to underline that we have a big interest in growth,\u201d said a senior German government official, speaking on condition of anonymity. But \u201cwe have common rules which we all agreed\u201d on regarding budget deficits and when to discuss them, the official said.Ms. Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, are far more likely to stick to balancing Germany\u2019s federal budget, \u201ca very strange objective to announce in current circumstances,\u201d Mr. Fratzscher, who is president of the German Institute of the Economy in Berlin, said in an interview. While they may agree to increase spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure in Germany, he added, the German leaders are not likely to back similar policies for France and Italy, which in Berlin\u2019s view cannot afford it.Outside Germany, however, alarm bells are ringing. Bernadette S\u00e9gol, leader of the European Confederation of Trade Unions, said Tuesday that the emphasis on budget rules was hindering attempts to pull out of problems that first appeared with the global financial crisis of 2007-8.\u201cEurope\u2019s disastrous response to the crisis \u2014 austerity \u2014 has led Europe to a social crisis and to within sight of a political crisis,\u201d she said, according to Agence France-Presse. \u201cEurope does not need more austerity; it needs new policies.\u201dMr. Fratzscher\u2019s book quotes on its cover Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s economics minister, leader of the left-leaning Social Democrats and Ms. Merkel\u2019s partner in the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d government formed just 10 months ago. Mr. Gabriel says Mr. Fratzscher \u201cmakes clear the problems we must tackle,\u201d adding that \u201cI read it to great advantage.\u201dUnfortunately for Mr. Gabriel, to judge by last year\u2019s national elections and votes last month in three of Germany\u2019s 16 states, the Social Democrats cannot muster even 25 percent of the popular support.Any push to back their center-left political allies in France\u2019s Socialist government, or Mr. Renzi\u2019s in Italy, is therefore sharply limited, since German voters seem to share Ms. Merkel\u2019s view that if Germany could trim its welfare state and still grow, others should be able to do the same. And Germany is not alone in its fight: The Dutch, Austrians and Scandinavians and the three Baltic states usually line up behind Ms. Merkel in any wrangling over fiscal policy.Alison Smale reported from Berlin and Liz Alderman from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wine Lists That Respect a Budget", "Date": "2014-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourWhat\u2019s the first thing you do when examining a restaurant wine list? If you are like me, you look to the least expensive wines, intent on good deals or at least good values. Possibly, you too have sighed in exasperation. Too often the cheapest end of the list is not so cheap.Chalk it up to rising rents, simple greed or the economy in general. As with so much else, the price of wine has gone up in the last few years. Just as we may be resigned to the $65 restaurant steak, so, too, have we silently accepted the sad fact that a bottle of Champagne or a modest young Burgundy on so many wine lists will cost no less than three figures. Yet more than a few restaurants are making a determined effort to augment the low end of the list, which nowadays at even the most cost-conscious restaurant is around $40 to $60 a bottle. In these places, wine is a treasured part of the aesthetic rather than simply a profit center, and wine directors try to ensure that everybody, even the lowest spenders, have access to wines the restaurant is proud to show off. \u201cI focus on small-production, naturally made wines,\u201d said Jorge Riera, the wine director at Contra on the Lower East Side. \u201cI want to make these wines accessible to more people.\u201dNo one would argue that the economics of running a restaurant are easy, especially in Manhattan, where rents and other costs verge on the insane. Add in the rising prices of shipping, storage, service and equipment, and it\u2019s easy to rationalize bottom-end inflation. Yet creative wine directors have many ways of getting around this problem. Sometimes it requires being open to wine regions of lesser status or renown, substituting wines from the Loire Valley, say, for regional Burgundies.\u201cThere\u2019s such a representation of regions today that used to be unknown,\u201d said Patrick Cappiello, wine director and a partner at Pearl & Ash, on the Lower East Side, where the wine list is great for spenders of every stripe. It also requires a shift in thinking. Restaurants may decide to discard rigid pricing formulas, the conventional two to two and a half times retail, opting instead for a softer markup, to be made up in other ways. Marta, the new pizzeria and trattoria opened by Danny Meyer\u2019s Union Square Hospitality Group, offers excellent values throughout the list, especially in Champagne, a category in which many wine directors feel free to inflate the prices. \u201cYou have to be a little generous first before you can expect generosity back,\u201d said John Ragan, who oversees wine for the restaurant group. \u201cIf maybe people drink two bottles instead of one, everybody wins. People will enjoy, and hopefully come back.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the Contra wine list. The small-production wines were on the list before Jorge Riera began working there, he did not add them.Email: asimov@nytimes.com. And follow Eric Asimov on Twitter: @EricAsimov.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour Shortage", "Date": "2014-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 It was a line that Labour Party speechwriters wished they had come up with themselves. \u201cEd Miliband will be a prime minister for Britons with second jobs, not just those with second homes,\u201d the mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, told a packed hall in Manchester, in the north of England.The mayor was the guest of honor at Labour\u2019s annual conference last month, and he came bearing rhetorical gifts. He depicted his hosts as comrades in arms against conservative vested interests; fellow crusaders for the striving many against an opulent few.It was everything the Labour leader\u2019s aides had hoped for: a charismatic American who had won with pledges to tackle inequality, insisting the same lines could work on this side of the Atlantic. As New York had been moved by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s \u201ctale of two cities,\u201d so would Britain\u2019s social schisms be healed under Mr. Miliband\u2019s \u201cone nation\u201d banner.And Mr. Miliband may indeed be prime minister after next May\u2019s general election. Opinion polls give Labour a consistent lead over the Conservatives. But the gap is narrowing and few in the party think their advantage has been won by the chief\u2019s fondness for egalitarian abstractions. On measures of leadership and trust in the economy, Mr. Miliband trails the incumbent prime minister, David Cameron.The Labour leader\u2019s own speech at the conference was a flop. Delivering the oration without notes, Mr. Miliband forgot passages on budget discipline and immigration \u2014 the two issues on which Labour is most vulnerable.The episode reinforced concerns in the party about its readiness for a very tight election battle. After four years in the job, Mr. Miliband has failed to project prime ministerial authority; he is awkward in front of a camera. Tory strategists delight in focus groups in which swing voters say they find the Labour leader ridiculous.The Conservative campaign will present Mr. Cameron as the serious candidate for dangerous times. Mr. Miliband will be dismissed as \u201cjust not up to it.\u201d It is a judgment many Labour members of Parliament privately share.So why aren\u2019t the Tories steaming ahead?One answer is that Britain elects parties, not presidents. The Eton-educated Mr. Cameron has failed to neutralize an old suspicion that Conservatives are a callous bunch who put the interests of rich white men first, while Labour\u2019s brand as the party of the downtrodden is resilient. The opposition\u2019s numbers are also bolstered by left-leaning voters who once backed the Liberal Democrats but fled in horror when that party formed a coalition with the Tories in 2010. Conservative numbers are also depressed by a flight of support to the U.K. Independence Party, a nationalist insurgency that casts immigration and the European Union as the sources of Britain\u2019s woes.Last week, UKIP acquired its first M.P., when Douglas Carswell, a Tory defector, retained his seat in a by-election in a depressed seaside town. A second Conservative turncoat will attempt the same move next month. But on the same day as Mr. Carswell\u2019s victory, UKIP also came within a few hundred votes of poaching a once safe Labour seat in a separate by-election on the outskirts of Manchester.Panic about the populist bandwagon, once a preserve of jittery Conservatives, has now spread to Mr. Miliband\u2019s camp. Labour M.P.s doubt their leader can satisfy the grievances of angry voters, including many in the party\u2019s working-class core, who see Westminster and its mainstream parties as an elite conspiracy. Mr. Miliband\u2019s metropolitan sensibilities and career politician background make him an unlikely antidote for anti-establishment rage.Mr. Miliband prefers to see the anti-politics mood as a product of a flawed capitalist model that allows a minority to hoard the fruits of growth while living standards fall and wages stagnate. This explains why, in Mr. Miliband\u2019s office, the de Blasio endorsement matters. The New York model mirrors Labour\u2019s pitch to a \u201csqueezed middle\u201d of voters who feel that intervention is needed to restore economic opportunity.In battleground constituencies where the election will be won, there is little gratitude for Mr. Cameron\u2019s policies and much suspicion that the recovery is a phantom. But there is also scant confidence that Mr. Miliband has a better plan. Labour has heaps of policies targeted at households with precarious finances \u2014 ideas for holding down energy bills, controlling rents and raising the minimum wage \u2014 but activists say that they are proving hard to sell on the doorstep because, at the national level, the party doesn\u2019t look like a credible agent for change. \u201cWe can win here on the ground, but it\u2019s much harder without air cover,\u201d said one Labour candidate. At the center, the party is dysfunctional, riven with rivalry and mistrust. Tough policy choices go unmade in a process of rolling consultation, with Mr. Miliband soliciting conflicting views and postponing the moment of decision. Shadow ministers complain that their voices are stifled and that their advice goes unheeded. They, in turn, are accused of not pulling their weight. M.P.s grumble that the leader\u2019s inner circle is stuffed with intellectuals and academics: a Ph.D. seminar group exploring paradigms of left-wing politics, not a military command.That gripe is a proxy for criticism of Mr. Miliband himself, who has built the whole project around an intellectual proposition. He believes the global financial crisis created an opportunity to change the terms of British political debate, restoring an ethic of solidarity that was corroded over a generation of individualistic, free-market orthodoxy. It is not the stuff of ready slogans.Meanwhile, disaffection with an unloved Tory administration is feeding other fires \u2014 separatism in Scotland and UKIP\u2019s xenophobia in England. Mr. Miliband offers himself as a solver of complex equations to an electorate that leans toward plain storytellers.That isn\u2019t an insurmountable obstacle. Contempt for Tories in large parts of the country, coupled with an electoral system tilted in Labour\u2019s favor, could give Mr. Miliband enough seats to form a government \u2014 though a healthy majority looks unlikely. But the prospect of eking out a hobbled legislative program with such a dismal mandate is almost as dispiriting to Labour as the threat of defeat.It was generous of Mr. de Blasio to say that Mr. Miliband\u2019s progressive vision will make him prime minister. As things stand, it seems more likely to happen by accident than design.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Has More on Its Plate", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLittle Serow, a Washington restaurant specializing in northern and northeastern Thai cuisine.WASHINGTON \u2014 On a scrubby block in a working-class neighborhood east of Rock Creek Park, plopped down among cheap hair salons, a dry cleaner and a sad-looking liquor store, the future of dining in Washington, D.C., has arrived.For decades, Washington\u2019s dining scene has been made up mostly of two kinds of restaurants. There are the expense-account steakhouses and hushed white-tablecloth hotel dining rooms catering to the political class with money to spend. At the other end are the cheap ethnic restaurants dotting the city and its outlying suburbs.In the last few years, an improving local economy has reordered this city where government and politics used to be the driving engine. Washington has bounced back from the high crime rates and extensive municipal scandals of the \u201980s, and has been largely impervious to the embattled national economy. It has been left with a population made up of fewer federal workers and more people employed in education, health care and hospitality.Many of those young new residents were looking for lower housing costs in areas once dominated by crime. Old townhomes became apartments; tiny bungalows have been restored. These younger residents were raised on the Food Network. And they are eager for good restaurants.From 2000 to 2010, the number of 18- to 34-year-old residents grew by roughly 37,000; they now make up 35 percent of the population, according to the Urban Institute. Last year, there were 2,111 restaurants in Washington, almost double the amount of a decade earlier, and a new one opens every week. As of Aug. 27, 878 alcoholic beverage licenses had been issued to restaurants in the district this year, a 10 percent increase over the total for all of 2013, which was larger than the previous four years.\u201cYou are seeing a shift from boomers to young people,\u201d said Mike Friedman, the chef at the Red Hen, who surprisingly opened in Bloomingdale last year in a building that had been empty for 30 years.His choice of spots came down to price, Mr. Friedman said. \u201cIt was a dangerous business decision in many respects,\u201d he said. \u201cWe banked on the fact that we had built-in clientele in the community, and we hoped people would check us out.\u201dOne summer night, Senators Mark Warner of Virginia, Michael Bennet of Colorado and Charles Schumer of New York cozied into the industrial space with its bare, weathered brick walls and stacks of firewood, where one drink is a rye concoction called All the Best Diseases Are Taken. \u201cMark Warner is the culinary Cousteau for senators hoping to find new hip places in Washington,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.More and more big-name out-of-town chefs like Mr. Chang are moving in.Many restaurants are pulling their influence from Southern traditions that have long marked D.C. cooking; the Chesapeake Bay, now chic; and local purveyors.\u201cWe have had the fortune of getting immigrants from all over the world,\u201d Mr. DeFerrari said. \u201cThe traditional profile of an ethnic restaurant is someone who had to leave their own country without much financial support so start a casual restaurant, but now we are seeing those roots established with people taking it to the next level.\u201dFurther, all the fresh action has increased rents and added some sharp elbows. Jeff Black, who has operated restaurants here since the 1990s, said that one chef tried to recruit two of his key staff members as he gave him a tour of one of his restaurants.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of one of the senators who ate at the Red Hen.

{"Headline": "Economists See Limited Gains in G.O.P. Plan", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Anticipating a takeover of Congress, Republicans have assembled an economic agenda that reflects their small-government, antiregulation philosophy, but also suggests internal divisions that could hinder a united front against President Obama \u2014 much as happened in the 1990s, when a Republican-led Congress confronted President Bill Clinton.The proposals would mainly benefit energy industries, reduce taxes and regulations for businesses generally, and continue the attack on the Affordable Care Act. It is a mix that leaves many economists, including several conservatives, underwhelmed.\u201cSome of those things will help,\u201d Matthew J. Slaughter, an economics professor at Dartmouth College, said after reviewing nearly four dozen measures that House Republicans have labeled \u201cjobs bills.\u201d He cited some business tax cuts, for example, even as he cautioned about the cost of such actions.\u201cBut,\u201d added Mr. Slaughter, who served on President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, \u201cit just struck me as sort of a compendium of modest expectations. If you ask me, \u2018What\u2019s your ballpark guess for how many jobs are going to be created?,\u2019 it\u2019s just not many.\u201dWith the prospect of Republicans\u2019 winning control of the Senate and maintaining control of the House in the midterm elections, interest is rising over what they would do to address what polls show is voters\u2019 top concern: economic growth and jobs.But Senate Republicans \u2014 many of whom must appeal to a broader range of voters than House Republicans, who mainly represent overwhelmingly conservative districts \u2014 chose just nine of those House measures for their own \u201cbipartisan jobs list.\u201dMissing from both Republican lists are two pillars of Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda that many economists consider important for expanding the labor force and promoting long-run growth.One is significantly higher spending for infrastructure. The International Monetary Fund recently called for such spending, saying it would pay off in broader economic growth.The other is an overhaul of immigration laws. Despite business pressure to provide a path to citizenship for the millions here illegally, and to admit more foreigners with skills, Republicans\u2019 opposition has only hardened in this campaign. A bipartisan Senate-passed bill on immigration would increase economic growth by 3.3 percent in a decade and save $175 billion by then, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.\u201cThat should be on anybody\u2019s list,\u201d Mr. Slaughter said.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who often advises Republicans, agreed. Of the Republicans\u2019 list generally, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think any of these are particular game changers.\u201dBut Mr. Holtz-Eakin said they could be \u201ca bridge\u201d to more. Recently, Mr. Boehner distilled his list into five general points \u2014 address the debt, overhaul the tax code, fix the legal system, rein in excessive regulations and strengthen education \u2014 that are more easily marketable, but also paper over party divisions.Mr. Boehner\u2019s spokesman, Kevin Smith, said the 46 House-passed bills were not \u201ca cure-all, but they would be a good start for our economy; we need to do more.\u201dWhile most economists and business executives do not look to Congress for much, they do want a rewriting of the corporate tax code and a revamping of fast-growing entitlement benefit programs, even as they ackowledge that is virtually unachievable.They would be content if Republicans simply \u201cdo no harm,\u201d as some put it, by avoiding self-imposed crises like the government shutdown last year that cost $24 billion and further across-the-board spending cuts that have been a drag on the economic recovery and kept pressure on the Federal Reserve to maintain its expansive monetary policy. Congressional Republicans, however, have said they are committed to continuing those spending cuts.The Republicans\u2019 jobs agenda is their response to those who say they need to stand for more than opposition to Mr. Obama.\u201cIt\u2019s a jobs-and-economy election,\u201d said David Winston, a Republican strategist. \u201cWe\u2019re a political party that needs to be offering alternatives if people are going to give us the responsibility to govern.\u201dThis month, Republicans were giddy when Mr. Obama, speaking at Northwestern University about the recovery and his agenda, said: \u201cMake no mistake: These policies are on the ballot.\u201dBut while the president is not popular, polls show that his economic proposals are, like a higher minimum wage, increased spending for infrastructure and higher taxes on the wealthy.When Mr. Obama sent Congress his jobs package three years ago, several forecasting firms estimated that it could add up to 150,000 jobs a month in the first year. He challenged Republicans to propose alternatives that could be similarly assessed.While private sector analysts say that the varied Boehner list is not suitable to their computer models, Joel Prakken, a founder of the St. Louis-based Macroeconomic Advisers, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you would get a rush of hiring from passing these bills.\u201dHis firm has analyzed some business tax cuts of the sort proposed by Republicans that would permanently allow deductions up front for the cost of new equipment. \u201cWe think they have minimal impact,\u201d Mr. Prakken said, yet the hundreds of billions of dollars in lost government revenue \u201cflies in the face\u201d of Republicans\u2019 vow to reduce debt.As for repealing the health law, \u201cthat would create a lot of economic uncertainty, and uncertainty is bad,\u201d Mr. Prakken said.Many of the bills would reduce federal regulation. Alan J. Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said, \u201cYou could certainly make an argument that relaxing all environmental regulations would increase employment, but there\u2019s a reason we have environmental regulations.\u201d Despite the environmental regulations that Republicans want to soften or end, the energy industry is booming \u2014 as even Mr. Boehner acknowledged last month in outlining his agenda at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank.\u201cThe boom is driving real growth,\u201d the speaker said, citing his home state, Ohio. \u201cIn Youngstown, as an example, unemployment today is half of what it was four years ago. It\u2019s a big deal!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Nuclear Deal, Now or Never", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Like it or not, the calendar of voting \u2014 here and in Iran \u2014 is driving the negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. A first, easy prediction: Don\u2019t expect progress in the few days that remain until America\u2019s Election Day. But then the tempo could ratchet up quickly. And it had better, if we are to expect a nuclear deal at all.The clock begins ticking on Election Day because Nov. 24 is the target date for a comprehensive agreement. But until the next Congress is chosen on Nov. 4, the Americans can\u2019t make politically risky promises and the Iranians can\u2019t react, not knowing where the balance of power between Republicans and Democrats will lie.Slightly more than a year from now, Iran will hold its own elections, which will ultimately decide who its next top leader will be. Given that the current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has set the balance of power between reformists and hard-liners, that choice could well change the direction of Iranian policy making on any potential deal for a very long time.These storm clouds will narrow the diplomats\u2019 room to maneuver as each election approaches. But they will also part long enough, between election seasons, to perhaps allow for dramatic new proposals and agreements. It is a complicated game: The elections affect the talks, and the rate of progress in the talks determines how voters feel. Each side must calculate not just how a final deal would resonate at home, but also when it would strengthen the hand of its most desired partner on the other side.Here is how this interwoven calendar is likely to play out:2014: The United States pegged the negotiations to its political calendar when it fixed the deadline for a final deal after next month\u2019s election. The calculation assumed that once the next Congress\u2019s makeup was known, Iranian negotiators who sought a deal would be eager to consummate one in plenty of time to show voters a rising economy, based on sanctions relief. If the Republicans do as well as expected, the Obama administration would also want to consolidate a deal quickly, before the new Congress meets in January. In theory, then, the best chance for a deal is in the next few months, when both sides\u2019 political motivations converge.But there is a big problem: The sides remain far apart. The United States and its partners insist that Iran cut its enrichment capability enough to preclude a rapid breakout toward producing a nuclear weapon; Iran refuses to consider any cut that could seem to dismantle its nuclear program. Iran also seeks full and immediate relief from economic sanctions; its opponents reject that as imprudent and impractical. Any deal would require both sides to compromise. And even a signed deal would be attacked by hard-liners in both countries, especially if President Obama bypassed Congress and suspended most sanctions on his own. Iran would be skeptical, since the next president could restore them.Does that mean a quick deal is not in the cards, forcing the talks to be extended well into next year? Not necessarily \u2014 even if the Republicans win big next month. In that case, Iran would question whether the next Congress would go along with any sanctions relief. And the weaker the Obama administration looked to Iranian negotiators, the more they would ask for broader sanctions relief up front.That would in turn make it more difficult for the administration to sell such an agreement to the current Congress \u2014 unless, of course, the Iranians significantly changed course on their demands to keep their enrichment program. So a big Republican win would only increase pressure on Mr. Obama and Iran to settle now or never.The other option \u2014 reset the clock and hope for a solid deal to emerge more slowly \u2014 is a poorer bet. The reason lies in the next election cycle.2015: In December 2015, Iran will elect a new Parliament. Within months, voters will also choose a Council of Experts, who in turn will pick the next supreme religious leader. Knowing how large those stakes are, Iran\u2019s negotiators already have their eyes on those elections. So should the American negotiators, because the date of any agreement could decide them.At the moment, Parliament is controlled by hard-liners. To change that, President Hassan Rouhani needs the economic benefits that a nuclear deal can bring. And he needs them soon, if they are to impress voters. In other words, the longer it takes to get a deal, the less likely it is that it can help Mr. Rouhani. Iran\u2019s conservatives know that: If a deal is reached at all, they want it later rather than sooner.Put that calendar together, and a strategy for America is clear. While the United States and its allies must achieve their core goals \u2014 effectively and dependably blocking Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear bomb \u2014 in any compromises they make, they need to remember, too, that getting a deal itself could be a game-changer in Iranian politics. The bet they should be making is on offering one while they still can; their counterparts are, after all, Iranian politicians whose interests lie in both achieving a nuclear deal and opening up their country. If the talks don\u2019t bear fruit soon, our narrow window of opportunity will shut, and the West will most likely have to contend with a far more recalcitrant Iran in an unstable Middle East.The Iranian hard-liners are betting that a turn to the right in America would sink the talks, and that an end to talks would hand them a long-term victory in Iran. So even if Congress turns further rightward, we need to quicken the negotiations and achieve a deal as soon as possible. The longer it takes, the more likely it is that politics here and in Iran will ultimately coalesce to sink any deal at all.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this essay misstated who will elect a Council of Experts in Iran. The council is chosen by the electorate, not by the members of Parliament.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Higher Education Doesn\u2019t Deliver on Its Promise", "Date": "2014-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDegrees of EducationTo ride the New York City subway system is to be immersed in advertisements for higher education: Learn a skill, get a job, change your life.By all appearances, the ad represented the free market for education and training at work. America\u2019s aging population and growing health care sector have created a strong demand for medical assistants, who check vital signs, schedule appointments and perform other tasks. More than 500,000 medical assistants were employed in 2012 and, as the poster correctly noted, the Labor Department projects growth of around 30 percent over the next 10 years. As a result, institutions like the Globe Institute of Technology are creating new programs to meet demand.But new federal data that track college graduates into the job market tell a far more sobering story. The market for medical-assistant education is deeply troubling.Many people who graduate from such programs struggle to find work. Those who do find work often make little money \u2014 too little to repay their debts from the program. Despite the happy poster images, the market for medical-assistant education is actually an allegory for the problems in the parts of higher education that tend to attract low-income and middle-class students: little regulation and uneven \u2014 often mediocre \u2014 results. The same problems afflict many community colleges, lower-tier four-year colleges and training programs in fields like office management and culinary arts.A small number of public community colleges have successful medical-assistant programs, minting graduates who make $25,000 per year or more. But the industry is dominated by for-profit colleges, which produce more than nine out of 10 medical assistant certificates nationwide. For-profit programs are typically expensive and financed primarily with federally backed grants and student loans.At the Texas School of Business in Houston, for example, the roughly 1,400 program graduates in 2008 and 2009 earned an average of $13,319 per year in 2011. There is no way to get paid that little as a full-time medical assistant. A spokesman for the national for-profit higher education corporation Kaplan, Inc., which owns the school, noted that the program\u2019s earnings results were only somewhat worse than the $14,651 average for all Texas medical-assistant programs, and that unemployment rates were unusually high in those years.The website of Drake College of Business in Elizabeth, N.J., promises, in large flashing letters, that students can complete a medical-assistant program \u201cin less than 8 months.\u201d But only 38 percent of graduates finish the program on time, and the average annual pay of recent graduates was only $12,031. Drake College declined to offer an explanation.Why is this market failing? Because the medical assistant certificate isn\u2019t what it seems to be in those advertisements.The labor market for most health care professionals is connected to long-established systems of education, regulation and licensing. Registered nurses, for example, are required to complete an accredited college nursing program and pass an official exam in order to obtain a nursing license. There are no exceptions: Without an accredited degree and license, you cannot be a nurse. People who earned a licensed vocational nursing certificate in 2008 and 2009 earned nearly $34,000 on average, despite the weak overall job market.A prospective student could be forgiven for glancing at a picture of a woman wearing nurse\u2019s scrubs and a stethoscope and believing that medical-assistant training programs promise entry to the same system. They don\u2019t.No state or federal law requires medical assistants to have a medical assistant certificate from a college. Among the hundreds of medical assistant job openings on Craigslist in the New York City metropolitan area, it\u2019s nearly impossible to find an employer who explicitly requires a certificate. Instead, the ads are full of phrases like \u201cexperienced multitasker,\u201d \u201cskilled phlebotomist\u201d and \u201cfluent in Russian.\u201dThe medical-assistant education market is inefficient because the American higher education system is largely unregulated. Every year, the federal government gives students $150 billion in grants and subsidized loans to attend any program offered by any accredited college. The assumption is that the free market will take care of the rest. But college is what economists call an \u201cexperiential good\u201d \u2014 something you can\u2019t entirely understand until after you purchase and experience it, at which point it may be too late.While the Obama administration is trying to crack down on abusive programs, its proposed new regulations have been delayed by a lawsuit filed by for-profit colleges. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently filed suit against the parent company of Everest College, which operates over two dozen medical assistant programs, citing an \u201cillegal predatory lending scheme.\u201d But most medical-assistant education programs remain open for business, looking for the next batch of students hoping to change their lives.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a government agency. It is called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, not the Consumer Financial Protection Board.Advertisement"}

Brown, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor and Democratic candidate for governor.In a jam-packed gymnasium, Mr. Obama urged the mostly African-American crowd of 8,000 to shake off any midterm malaise and show up on Nov. 4 to put Mr. Brown in the governor\u2019s mansion.\u201cThere are no excuses. The future is up to us,\u201d the president said, his voice rising above the roar of the enthusiastic crowd. \u201cIf you want better policies out of Washington, you\u2019ve got to vote for them. If you want better policies in Maryland, you have to go vote for them.\u201dMr. Obama accused Republicans of betting that Democrats will not show up in November. But, he insisted, \u201cI\u2019m banking that strategy is not going to work.\u201dThe latest Washington Post poll in Maryland showed Mr. Brown with a nine-point lead over Larry Hogan, his Republican challenger. But the survey also showed Mr. Brown, who is black, drawing only 77 percent of African-American voters. In 2012, Mr. Obama won 97 percent of the black vote in the state, according to an exit poll conducted by Edison Research.At the rally, Mr. Obama urged the audience to reject a Republican philosophy that he said had been thoroughly discredited in recent years.\u201cThey keep on offering the same tired, worn-out theories,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the Republicans, citing tax breaks, looser regulations and a reduced safety net. \u201cWe have tried all those things. We tried \u2019em before I came into office. We know they did not work.\u201dBefore Mr. Obama\u2019s speech ended, a steady trickle of people had departed, leaving some empty seats. And an immigration activist interrupted the speech, holding a sign demanding that \u201c#Not1more\u201d immigrant be deported. As the crowd bellowed the protester away, Mr. Obama suggested that he \u201cshould have been protesting the folks that are blocking\u201d an immigration overhaul.Mr. Obama\u2019s appearance on behalf of Mr. Brown and a rally scheduled later in the day for Pat Quinn, the Democratic governor of Illinois, were the president\u2019s first small steps back on the campaign stage ahead of the midterm elections. The two candidates are eager for the star power that Mr. Obama still brings when it comes to firing up the core constituencies in the party: women, African-Americans, Latinos and gays.In Chicago, an energized Mr. Obama whipped up a crowd at a gymnasium at Chicago State University, urging people to support Mr. Quinn when early voting begins on Monday.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to grab your friends. You\u2019ve got to grab your co-workers,\u201d Mr. Obama told about 6,200 people, adding that he planned to vote on Monday morning in Chicago.Mr. Quinn, who is running against Bruce Rauner, the Republican nominee, is a longtime Obama friend. The president described him as someone who is not slick, not packaged \u2014 someone who deserves the votes of people in Illinois.\u00a0\u201cPat is real. He is who he is. He\u2019s not trying to front. He\u2019s not trying to pretend,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cHe\u2019s out there fighting for you.\u201dThe president has been delivering a campaign stump speech for months, but only at fund-raising events, and largely for high-dollar donors who have helped to provide Democratic candidates a financial edge this season.In those events, Mr. Obama has been unapologetic about his policies, arguing that they have repaired an economy that was in tatters, increased domestic energy production, restored home values and reduced the school dropout rate.At the fund-raisers, Mr. Obama has also been critical of Republicans in Congress, a group that he says has blocked a vision that a majority of Americans share. He has urged the donors to fight against what he calls a \u201ccongenital problem\u201d for Democrats: their unwillingness to turn out in midterm elections as they do in presidential years.Mr. Obama\u2019s return to the public stage with a similar message is intended to help solve that problem in the final stretch, as Democratic candidates seek to ensure that their must-have voters show up on Election Day.But the visits to Maryland and Illinois were also a reminder of where the president\u2019s message is not welcome \u2014 the many conservative-leaning states where Democratic Senate candidates are struggling because of the president\u2019s sinking popularity.Maryland and Illinois are, after all, heavily Democratic states where the candidates should have little trouble winning elections. The fact that Mr. Obama used his valuable time to campaign there, with only 16 days left, was proof that his power to help is severely constrained.White House officials had once hoped to help Democratic candidates drive an economic-themed message focused on the minimum wage and issues of importance to women.Instead, the president has had to attend to one crisis after another: the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the downing of a passenger plane there; the escalation of the conflict in Iraq and Syria; the beheading of Western hostages; the angry protests in Ferguson, Mo., in the wake of the killing of an unarmed black youth; and, most recently, the Ebola virus in West Africa and the United States.It is unclear exactly how those crises will affect the outcome of races next month. But it is certain that they have diverted the president\u2019s attention from the message he had hoped to deliver. And his handling of the foreign crises is increasingly unpopular, adding to the worry among Democrats.Advertisement"}

Jim Grant, for example, told Bloomberg we have had inflation \u2014 it just hasn\u2019t shown up in consumer prices.Doug Holtz-Eakin, once John McCain\u2019s top economic adviser, explained that the letter was correct because it didn\u2019t set a date on its inflation prediction.

{"Headline": "What Janet Yellen Said, and Didn\u2019t Say, About Inequality", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and Outcomes\u201cThe extent of and continuing increase in inequality in the United States greatly concern me,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. \u201cI think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation\u2019s history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity.\u201dNothing about those statements would seem unusual coming from a left-leaning politician or any number of professional commentators. What makes them unusual is hearing them from the nation\u2019s economist-in-chief, who generally tries to steer as far away from contentious political debates as possible.Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech is a thorough airing of some of the latest research on how much inequality has widened in recent years and why. In the course of 4,300 words, she explores the role of rising debt loads poor students must incur to get a college education, a slowdown in small-business formation, and trends in inheritances, among other issues.But in many ways the issues she leaves out are more instructive. In particular, she stays away from the aspects of the inequality puzzle that have a close tie-in to the policies of the Federal Reserve.First, there is a growing body of evidence \u2014 far from proven, but certainly gaining traction \u2014 that income inequality could be a significant force behind disappointing overall economic growth over the last 15 years.The story goes like this: The wealthy tend to save a large proportion of their income, whereas middle and lower-income people spend almost all of what they earn. Because a rising share of income is going to the wealthy, spending \u2014 and hence aggregate demand \u2014 is rising more slowly than it would if there were more even distribution of income. Skyrocketing debt levels papered over this disconnect in the mid-2000s, but now we could be feeling its effect.If true, this would help account for why the economy has notched mediocre growth since the turn of the century, with the exception being a brief period of the housing bubble.It would also have big implications for Fed policy. It would imply that, under the current economic arrangement, the nation\u2019s potential economic growth is lower than it might otherwise be. Which implies that it would be dangerous for the Fed to try to seek growth much faster than that using monetary policy, as doing so might unleash inflation, financial bubbles or both.A second area in which monetary policy interacts with inequality \u2014 and which Ms. Yellen also leaves unaddressed \u2014 is the role of the Fed\u2019s easy money policies in encouraging inequality.For the last five years of economic expansion, Congress has been unwilling to use fiscal policy to try to encourage faster growth. That has left the Fed as the only game in town, and the Bernanke Fed again and again turned to quantitative easing and ultralow interest rate policies to try to shock the economy into speedier expansion. (Ms. Yellen was the No. 2 official at the Fed for most of this time, and helped engineer the policies).But this has contributed to an imbalanced form of growth in the United States. Many of the first-order effects of the Fed\u2019s bond buying have been, for example, to drive up the stock market and to help lower mortgage rates. Because stocks are disproportionately owned by the wealthy and the upper middle class have been in best position to refinance their mortgages, the benefits of Fed policy for middle and low-income workers have been more indirect.It is unclear what that means for the proper course of monetary policy. If quantitative easing policies led to stronger overall growth that are the reason employers are adding more jobs, then the trickle-down benefits for ordinary workers are still meaningful. But Ms. Yellen did not address in her speech whether she agrees with the premise that a Fed-driven economic recovery has contributed to inequality, and if so what it implies for her agency.It seems like Ms. Yellen offered this speech as a way to use her bully pulpit to cast public attention on an issue she cares about deeply, deliberately avoiding areas where inequality intersects with the policy areas under which she has direct control. And it is true that the future of inequality in the United States is surely shaped more by decisions on the levels of certain taxes and the size of the social welfare state more than by anything that the Fed does.Perhaps in future appearances, Ms. Yellen will give us a sense not just of what is wrong with inequality, but what it might mean for the policies over which she has some control.Advertisement"}

Indonesia, an emerging democracy, is the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation and has the largest economy in Southeast Asia.Mr. Joko\u2019s vice president, Jusuf Kalla, also took the oath of office during the session.Among the foreign dignitaries attending the ceremony were Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia and John Kerry, the American secretary of state.Mr. Prabowo, however, leads a coalition of opposition parties that control a majority of seats and all the leadership positions in the House of Representatives and that has vowed to challenge Mr. Joko\u2019s policy agenda at every turn. Some opposition leaders have vowed to be obstructionist and have even called for corruption investigations against the new president from his time as mayor of Surakarta, in Central Java, and as governor of Jakarta.Following a meeting last Friday between the pair to ease tensions, Mr. Prabowo attended Monday\u2019s inauguration. Mr. Joko referred to him as \u201cmy good friend\u201d during his speech.The new president has promised more \u201cpeople-centric\u201d government programs in a country where, despite membership in the Group of 20 major economies, more than 100 million people live on $2 a day or less, and the disparity between the rich and poor is at a record high, according to economists.Many characterized the unlikely presidential victory by Mr. Joko over Mr. Prabowo as a battle between a commoner and someone from Indonesia\u2019s political elite and authoritarian past.Mr. Joko, a former carpenter and small-business man, made mention of the masses that rallied around him during the election campaign in his 10-minute inaugural address, during which he called on national government officials and the Civil Service to work to improve the lot of the country\u2019s poor.\u201cThis is a truly historic moment for all of us to come together,\u201d the new president said. \u201cThrough hard work and cooperation, we will be able to help all Indonesians,\u201d he added later.Despite having a minority governing coalition, Mr. Joko has said he expected members of Mr. Prabowo\u2019s coalition to eventually switch sides and join his administration, in that way giving him a majority and increasing his ability to pass legislation. The new president has promised more government programs for farmers, fishermen and other traditional laborers, and more spending on health care and social services for the poor.Mr. Joko also gave an indication in his address of his foreign policy plans to turn Indonesia into a \u201cmaritime power,\u201d noting that the country is the world\u2019s largest archipelago.After the swearing-in ceremony, Mr. Joko\u2019s presidential motorcade traveled through central Jakarta to greet the public before he was taken to the Presidential Palace in a traditional horse-drawn carriage. A number of inaugural events were planned for later in the day and evening.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gov. Cuomo\u2019s Debate Follies", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWith New York elections less than a month away, Gov. Andrew Cuomo is on a vigorous campaign to sell his new autobiography. What\u2019s missing from this busy schedule is the political reality of the moment. Mr. Cuomo is running for re-election on Nov. 4, and, so far, he has agreed to a single one-hour televised debate with three other candidates, including Rob Astorino, the Republican in the race. That isn\u2019t sufficient for voters who need to hear and see the back and forth on issues like ethics in Albany, taxes, women\u2019s rights and the economy. Mr. Astorino, the Westchester County executive, has said at least five such debates were proposed, mostly by news organizations. However, Mr. Cuomo is willing to participate only in a group debate \u2014 which would include Mr. Astorino and candidates from the Green and Libertarian parties \u2014 in Buffalo on Oct. 22. While this is better than nothing, the format means that the four candidates will essentially be participating in a panel discussion that allows less time for each candidate to challenge the others, and Mr. Cuomo knows that. The Cuomo campaign has said that the governor had agreed to one radio debate with Mr. Astorino. Unfortunately, Mr. Astorino refused the offer because he wanted it to be televised, a demand the Cuomo campaign rejected. In Connecticut, Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, and his Republican rival, Tom Foley, are doing it right. They are participating in heated debates on a variety of issues, including taxes, marijuana, casinos and gun control. So far, the two main candidates have participated in four debates, three of them televised. And the campaigns are scheduling others before Election Day. Mr. Cuomo has raised more than $44 million for his campaign, compared with Mr. Astorino\u2019s $4 million. The governor has a hefty lead in the polls. Still, New Yorkers deserve to see real, unscripted debates between their the two main choices for governor. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Misplaced Faith in Free Trade", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionTrade is one of the few areas on which mainstream economists firmly agree: More is better. But as the Obama administration pursues two huge new trade deals \u2014 one with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the other with the European Union \u2014 Americans are skeptical. Only 17 percent believe that more trade leads to higher wages, according to a Pew Research Center survey released last month. Just 20 percent think trade creates jobs; 50 percent say it destroys them. The skeptics are on to something. Free trade creates winners and losers \u2014 and American workers have been among the losers. Free trade has been a major (but not the only) factor behind the erosion in wages and job security among American workers. It has created tremendous prosperity \u2014 but mostly for those at the top. Little wonder, then, that Americans, in another Pew survey, last winter, ranked protecting jobs as the second-most-important goal for foreign policy, barely below protecting us from terrorism. Many economists dismiss these attitudes as the griping of people on the losing end of globalization, but they would do better to look inward, at the flaws in their models and theories. Since the 1970s, economic orthodoxy has argued for low tariffs, free capital flows, elimination of industrial subsidies, deregulation of labor markets, balanced budgets and low inflation. This philosophy \u2014 later known as the Washington Consensus \u2014 was the basis of advice the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank gave to developing countries in return for financial help. The irony is that during the Industrial Revolution, today\u2019s rich countries \u2014 Britain, France and the United States \u2014 pursued the very opposite policies: high tariffs, government investment in industry, financial regulations and fixed values for currencies. Trade expanded, and capital flowed anyway. World War II changed everything. Tariffs were seen as having exacerbated the Depression, and inadequate globalization as one cause of the two world wars. So, through the late 1970s, the United States and Europe cut tariffs, though currencies were fixed and capital was still highly controlled. Astonishing American prosperity in the three decades after 1945 led economists to overestimate the impact of free trade. In reality, high growth in those years resulted from many factors: pent-up demand from the war; the Marshall Plan; Cold War military spending; investments in universities, highways and scientific research; and falling oil prices. Starting in the 1970s, however, under the influence of free-market enthusiasts like Milton Friedman, economists urged further removal of barriers to trade and capital flows, hoping to turn the world into one highly efficient market, unobstructed by government. The results were often disastrous. The lowering of protective tariffs did not lead to rapid growth in Latin America, which stagnated in the 1980s. Mr. Friedman\u2019s acolytes also urged the reduction or elimination of capital controls \u2014 starting in the 1970s in the United States, and in the 1980s in Europe \u2014 along with lower tariffs. This, too, was ruinous. An exodus of short-term investments contributed to financial crises in East Asia, Russia, Argentina and Turkey in the mid-1990s, and to the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998 (a prelude to the 2008 crisis). Though these mistakes were recognized, the World Trade Organization continued to push one-size-fits-all rules, premised more on ideology than experience, that hurt developing countries. In 1995, it demanded that members substantially reduce subsidies for export industries. Imagine what would have happened if South Korea, Japan and Taiwan had had to follow this guidance; they became economic powerhouses in the 1960s and 1970s by nurturing their export sectors. (To join the W.T.O., in 2001, China was forced to slash industrial subsidies, but it resorted to currency manipulation to boost its export sector.) Also that year, the W.T.O. adopted a rule obliging members to abide by rich nations\u2019 patent laws. (Never mind that Americans stole technologies from Europe throughout the 1800s.) These laws typically enabled investors in rich countries to reap substantial rewards, while poor nations like India were forced to pay the same price for patented drugs as the rich West, because they were not allowed to make generic substitutes.But the consensus was flawed. Even free-trade advocates now admit that American wages have been reduced as a result of outsourcing, the erosion of manufacturing and an ever-increasing reliance on imports. Middle-income countries, meanwhile, have been blocked from adopting policies that might make them world-class competitors. Nations that have ignored the nostrums of the Washington Consensus \u2014 China, India and Brazil \u2014 have grown rapidly and raised their standards of living. Improvements in poverty and inequality occurred in Latin America only in the 2000s, after the I.M.F. and the World Bank reduced their grip on those nations.Expanding global markets is a worthy goal, but history offers lessons that can lead to more constructive trade, capital and currency policies. The first is that gradual reform is more effective than a sudden turn to free markets, deregulation and privatization. Shock therapy in Russia was a failure, and nations from Argentina to Thailand paid a dear price for liberalizing capital markets too quickly. The historical models of sustained growth are clear: gradual development of core industries; economic diversification; improvements in literacy and education, especially for women; slow, deliberate opening of capital markets; and the protection of labor from abusive pay and working conditions. A second lesson is that nations should be left space for experimentation. Some spend too much on social programs, others too little; some need transportation infrastructure, others improved banking; some require literacy programs, others advanced education; some need to subsidize emerging industries, others to privatize bloated state industries; some need worker protections like unemployment insurance, others need labor mobility. Most have too few regulations to protect the environment, finance and consumers. A third lesson is that models of growth that depend indefinitely on exports are not sustainable. The large imbalances in trade between China and the United States distort economies. The same is true of Germany\u2019s huge trade surpluses, which are based on a fixed euro and restrained domestic wages. Finally \u2014 and this is especially true for rich nations \u2014 every free-trade agreement should come with a plan to strengthen the social safety net, through job training, help for displaced workers, and longer-term and higher unemployment benefits. Free-trade deals must also be accompanied by policies to stimulate growth through infrastructure investments, subsidies for clean energy and, perhaps, other industries, as well as loans to small businesses, and even wage subsidies.Free trade has been a priority for the Obama administration, but Congress, wisely, has not given it \u201cfast track\u201d authority, as it gave Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, to negotiate new trade deals without its approval. Any trans-Pacific agreement, its terms still a secret, should be discussed in the open with ample protection of worker rights and healthy debate over regulatory changes requested by developing countries or big business. A trade agreement with the European Union makes more sense, but the danger is that environmental, financial and product-safety regulations will be watered down to meet the demands of corporate interests. Economists are correct that free trade need not be a zero-sum game. But the genuine gains in prosperity from free trade can be maximized, and broadly shared, only if the policy errors of the past 40 years are properly understood. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Way for Local Businesses to Grow", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorON Tuesday, Michigan became the first state in the country to enact a law allowing the modern equivalent of a local stock market. The Michigan Investment Markets bill went little noticed. But it revives a forgotten American tradition that once fueled economic growth \u2014 and perhaps could again. The United States was once teeming with local stock markets. Boston, Baltimore, Milwaukee and San Francisco were among the earliest to establish exchanges. From 1863 to 1930, as America expanded, at least 24 stock exchanges debuted, from Richmond, Va., to Salt Lake City to Honolulu. The exchanges were important institutions in their communities, both socially and economically. Their member-brokers were often prominent citizens, and they offered shares of native businesses to local investors. The Seattle Exchange listed Olympia Brewing Company and the Alaska Pacific Salmon Company, while the Cincinnati Stock Exchange nurtured growing Midwestern businesses, including Kroger, a local grocer with 40 stores that went public in 1902, and a soap maker called Procter & Gamble that listed on the exchange a few years later.In Michigan, the Detroit Stock Exchange helped rev up the infant auto industry in the early 1900s, providing growth capital to innovative start-ups like General Motors and the Maxwell Motor Company (now Chrysler).Then came the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934, landmark legislation that, in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, imposed stringent registration and reporting requirements on publicly traded companies. That hurt the local exchanges. As a Time magazine article from 1936 explained: \u201cBecause a listing on a small exchange requires the same painful revelations as on the New York Stock Exchange, corporations tended to seek listing there in addition to a listing on a local market. When that happens local trading generally begins to dry up.\u201dAdvances in communications technology only hastened the shift, until one by one, the local markets merged or closed. The Standard Stock Exchange of Spokane, a mining-heavy market, was among the last of its kind to close, in 1991. Today, the local exchanges are long forgotten. The modern financial markets that replaced them are global and efficient, but they no longer serve the growing regional companies that they once did. The costs of going public have risen. While $10 million initial public offerings were commonplace 25 years ago, the median initial stock offering soared to around $140 million in recent years. David Weild IV, chief executive of IssuWorks and a former vice chairman of Nasdaq who has researched the decline in small-company capital formation, has argued that the public markets are effectively closed to 80 percent of the companies that need them. As for investors, they\u2019re left to choose between putting their money in a market that is subject to the whims of high-frequency traders and short-term speculators, or under the mattress. Many would like to be able to invest in local and regional growth companies that benefit their local economies. Which brings us back to Michigan. The Michigan Investment Markets bill does not create a new stock market. It modifies existing law to provide a regulatory framework that an intrastate market can operate within. The markets would be regulated at the state level as broker-dealers, and would deal solely with Michigan-based investors and securities. The law follows on the heels of the Michigan Invests Locally Exemption (MILE), which went into effect earlier this year. It allows any Michigan-based company to raise up to $2 million in a 12 month period, with a financial audit or review (or $1 million without such disclosure), from any resident of the state through crowdfunding. This sort of investment crowdfunding was a key feature of the JOBS Act, signed into law by President Obama in April 2012. But JOBS Act crowdfunding cannot begin until the Securities and Exchange Commission finalizes the rules that will govern it, and the agency is already nearly two years past its deadline. Moreover, the rules the agency has proposed are likely to be too onerous for the small businesses the act was intended to help. With federal crowdfunding stalled, Michigan is one of a growing number of states that have adopted their own crowdfunding laws \u2014 on Wednesday, Texas became the 13th, and most populous, state to do so. The state laws are generally less burdensome and aim to do what the JOBS Act has so far failed to do: make it easier for small businesses to get funding, especially in communities far from money centers and venture capital networks. That was the case for the Tecumseh Brewing Company, the first company to use the MILE law. Through crowdfunding it raised $175,000. One of the main drawbacks to crowdfunding has been a lack of liquidity: investors can resell their shares, but without a central market, it is hard for them to find buyers. A Michigan investment market would connect buyers and sellers of securities issued by Michigan companies like Tecumseh Brewing. The law is brand-new, but already some local and statewide groups have expressed interest in creating markets. Who knows, a Detroit stock market could someday rise again. Or a Lansing market, or a Grand Rapids market. And that could only be a good thing for the region\u2019s economy.Amy Cortese is the author of \u201cLocavesting: The Revolution in Local Investing and How To Profit From It.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Markets Will", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the Middle Ages, the call for a crusade to conquer the Holy Land was met with cries of \u201cDeus vult!\u201d \u2014 God wills it. But did the crusaders really know what God wanted? Given how the venture turned out, apparently not. Now, that was a long time ago, and, in the areas I write about, invocations of God\u2019s presumed will are rare. You do, however, see a lot of policy crusades, and these are often justified with implicit cries of \u201cMercatus vult!\u201d \u2014 the market wills it. But do those invoking the will of the market really know what markets want? Again, apparently not. And the financial turmoil of the past few days has widened the gap between what we\u2019re told must be done to appease the market and what markets actually seem to be asking for.To get more specific: We have been told repeatedly that governments must cease and desist from their efforts to mitigate economic pain, lest their excessive compassion be punished by the financial gods, but the markets themselves have never seemed to agree that these human sacrifices are actually necessary. Investors were supposed to be terrified by budget deficits, fearing that we were about to turn into Greece \u2014 Greece I tell you \u2014 but year after year, interest rates stayed low. The Fed\u2019s efforts to boost the economy were supposed to backfire as markets reacted to the prospect of runaway inflation, but market measures of expected inflation similarly stayed low. How have policy crusaders responded to the failure of their dire predictions? Mainly with denial, occasionally with exasperation. For example, Alan Greenspan once declared the failure of interest rates and inflation to spike \u201cregrettable, because it is fostering a false sense of complacency.\u201d But that was more than four years ago; maybe the sense of complacency wasn\u2019t all that false?All in all, it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that people like Mr. Greenspan knew as much about what the market wanted as medieval crusaders knew about God\u2019s plan \u2014 that is, nothing. In fact, if you look closely, the real message from the market seems to be that we should be running bigger deficits and printing more money. And that message has gotten a lot stronger in the past few days. I\u2019m not mainly talking about plunging stock prices, although that\u2019s surely telling us something (but as the late Paul Samuelson famously pointed out, stocks are not a reliable indicator of economic prospects: \u201cWall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions!\u201d) Instead, I\u2019m talking about interest rates, which are flashing warnings, not of fiscal crisis and inflation, but of depression and deflation.Most obviously, interest rates on long-term U.S. government debt \u2014 the rates that the usual suspects keep telling us will shoot up any day now unless we slash spending \u2014 have fallen sharply. This tells us that markets aren\u2019t worried about default, but that they are worried about persistent economic weakness, which will keep the Fed from raising the short-term interest rates it controls. Interest rates on much European debt are even lower, because Europe\u2019s economic outlook is so bad, and we\u2019re not just talking about Germany. France is currently in conflict with the European Commission, which says that the projected French deficit is too big, but investors \u2014 who are still buying French bonds despite a 10-year interest rate of only 1.26 percent \u2014 are evidently much more worried about European stagnation than French default. It\u2019s also instructive to look at interest rates on \u201cinflation-protected\u201d or \u201cindex\u201d bonds, which are telling us two things. First, markets are practically begging governments to borrow and spend, say on infrastructure; interest rates on index bonds are barely above zero, so that financing for roads, bridges, and sewers would be almost free. Second, the difference between interest rates on index and ordinary bonds tells us how much inflation the market expects, and it turns out that expected inflation has fallen sharply over the past few months, so that it\u2019s now far below the Fed\u2019s target. In effect, the market is saying that the Fed isn\u2019t printing nearly enough money.One question you might ask is why the market\u2019s pro-spending, print-more-money message has suddenly gotten louder. My guess is that it\u2019s mainly driven by events in Europe, where the slide into deflation and the growing public backlash against austerity have reached a tipping point. And it\u2019s very reasonable to worry that Europe\u2019s problems may spill over to the rest of us.In any case, the next time you hear some talking head opining on what we must do to satisfy the markets, ask yourself, \u201cHow does he know?\u201d For the truth is that when people talk about what markets demand, what they\u2019re really doing is trying to bully us into doing what they themselves want.

{"Headline": "Ukrainian Voters Affirm Embrace of Europe and Reject Far Right ", "Date": "2014-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 In a parliamentary election with historic ramifications, Ukrainians overwhelmingly reaffirmed on Sunday their support for the ideals of the February revolt in the Maidan and the country\u2019s push to the West, while rejecting far-right nationalist parties.The result, with pro-European political parties led by President Petro O. Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk winning the largest number of seats in Parliament, solidifies the authority of a government that, despite firm Western backing, has been unable to suppress a violent, pro-Russian separatist movement along Ukraine\u2019s eastern border.The challenge of soothing concerns in eastern Ukraine will be heightened by the fact that voting was impossible in many parts of the region, where pro-Russian rebels largely made good on their promise to block the vote. Voting also did not take place in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in March. As a result, as many as 27 of the 450 seats in Parliament \u2014 12 in Crimea and 15 in eastern Ukraine \u2014 will remain unfilled, at least initially.With nearly 70 percent of votes counted by Monday evening, Mr. Yatsenyuk\u2019s People\u2019s Front had garnered a surprising 21.7 percent of votes, slightly outpacing the president\u2019s coalition, Bloc Petro Poroshenko, which had 21.4 percent in the nationwide vote for party preference, according to the Central Election Commission. Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s party, however, was on track to win a larger number of races in the individual districts that fill half of the Parliament\u2019s 450 seats, virtually assuring that it would be the dominant force in any majority coalition.In a sign of how intensely Ukrainians wanted to break from their Soviet past, not a single Communist Party candidate was elected. In a message on Twitter, Mr. Poroshenko noted that it would be the first time in 96 years that Communists would not be represented in the Ukrainian legislature.Mr. Poroshenko was combining the current Parliament, called the Verkhovna Rada, with early Soviet entities that existed after 1917.More relevant to Ukraine\u2019s current situation, however, was the poor showing of the far-right parties that Russia had accused of seizing control of Ukrainian politics, and that the Kremlin said were a reason for its invasion and annexation of Crimea.Right Sector, portrayed as the spearhead of a neofascist coup by Russia\u2019s government-controlled news media since the ouster of the former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, received only 1.6 percent of the vote, far short of the minimum 5 percent threshold to join Parliament.A Right Sector leader, Dimytro Yarsosh, did apparently win a seat, however, by running as an individual candidate in his native region of Dnipropetrovsk.The outcome seemed certain to strengthen the positions of Ukraine\u2019s current leaders and will most likely give them the broad support in Parliament they require to push ahead with urgent, and potentially painful, changes as the country struggles with an economy on the brink of collapse.The big pro-European majority also creates a challenge, however. As the pro-Western leaders try to end the uprising in the east, they will have to persuade people there that they, too, will be fairly represented in Kiev.\u201cWe have tough times ahead,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk acknowledged in a statement after polling stations closed on Sunday, \u201cbut together we will overcome all difficulties.\u201dIn Moscow, the foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, told reporters that Russia was prepared to accept the election results, though he repeated the Kremlin\u2019s frequent criticisms that the Kiev government was responsible for fracturing Ukraine.In Washington, the reaction was much more positive. President Obama issued a statement congratulating the Ukrainian government and its people, while also accusing Russian-backed separatists of preventing the voting in the embattled east. He called on Russia to use its influence with the separatists.Sunday\u2019s vote represented a stunning success, personally, for Mr. Yatsenyuk, a skilled technocrat who is respected by political colleagues in the West but has historically lacked sparkle on the campaign trail. His party far outperformed the predictions of public opinion surveys leading up to the vote on Sunday, and the show of muscle seemed to assure that he could keep the post of prime minister. Even on Election Day, he acknowledged that was uncertain and that his political future hinged on the outcome of the vote.One party that is generally, if not quite accurately, regarded as pro-Russian cleared the 5 percent threshold needed to form a faction in Parliament. The party, the Opposition Bloc, includes many former allies of Mr. Yanukovych and could prove crucial to any political settlement to the crisis in eastern Ukraine.As of Monday evening, the Opposition Bloc had won 9.8 percent. Mr. Yarosh, the leader of the right-wing Right Sector party, said his group would not accept the election results because of the participation of the Opposition Bloc and the former allies of Mr. Yanukovych.The government said there were no major problems during Sunday\u2019s vote. International observers gave the election high technical marks in their preliminary findings, saying the government had done a good job, at least in the areas where it controlled voting stations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "French Minister Attends German Cabinet Session ", "Date": "2014-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Like two next-door neighbors who have had a bit of a falling out over their divergent economic circumstances, Germany and France seem to be making a special effort to make up. Speaking privately, German officials have expressed alarm at the unpopularity of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, whose Socialist Party garnered barely 14 percent of votes in European parliamentary elections in May. The rise of Marine Le Pen and her populist National Front, which won 25 percent of the vote in May, worries Berlin, where Chancellor Angela Merkel remains popular after nine years in power.So far, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble has declined to do so, and he won vocal backing from the Social Democrats with whom Ms. Merkel\u2019s center-right party governs in a coalition. Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel, the Social Democrats\u2019 leader, said Tuesday that there was no need to change course even as he announced that the government was now projecting just 1.2 percent growth in Germany this year, down from 1.8 percent predicted earlier.However, both Mr. Sch\u00e4uble \u2014 perhaps the most vocal advocate in the government of European integration \u2014 and Mr. Gabriel seem eager to engage the French in new common projects to overcome the perceived rift between Europe\u2019s indispensable couple.The Finance Ministry announced Wednesday that two German ministers would host their French counterparts, Finance Minister Michel Sapin and Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron, on Monday in Berlin.Hours later, Mr. Macron unveiled a blueprint for proposed legislation intended to help lift competitiveness in France\u2019s flagging economy, a move that appeared to nod at German demands that France push structural overhauls faster than the government has been doing.The measures include plans to allow shops to open on Sundays and late into the evening, and to open the market for notaries and aspects of the legal profession to new competition. \u201cWe need to remove all obstacles that impede growth,\u201d he said at a news briefing.In addition, according to a document seen by Reuters recently, Mr. Gabriel and Mr. Macron have assigned two influential academics, one in Paris and the other in Berlin, to come up with ways to expand cooperation. They are expected to present their ideas in November.Liz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Greenhouse Gas Deal Falls Short of Expectations", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The deal reached early Friday by the European Union to cap its greenhouse gas emissions was meant to increase pressure on the rest of the world to achieve a landmark accord on climate protection next year, the bloc\u2019s leaders said.That target will send \u201ca strong signal to other big economies and all other countries,\u201d said Connie Hedegaard, the European Union commissioner for climate action. \u201cWe have done our homework; now we urge you to follow Europe\u2019s example,\u201d she said.But environmentalists said the agreement, approved at a summit meeting here after late-night marathon negotiations, amounted to a weak compromise reflecting the complexity of managing a bloc of 28 member nations with widely varying energy systems. Elements of the deal were watered down to account for countries like Poland that rely on carbon-heavy coal, and for countries like Britain that were unwilling to accept binding targets on such other measures as the percentage of energy that comes from renewable sources and energy efficiency.\u201cThe E.U. deal was probably the best compromise that progressive countries could hope for, given concerns of various nations about coal-burning and competitiveness,\u201d said Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a nonprofit organization in Britain. \u201cHowever, it is also a compromise with the climate system and with the needs of future generations.\u201dThe European Union had come to the 2030 target after determining that it was the only way the union could keep its 2009 pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95 percent of 1990 levels by midcentury.Mr. Black said even so, he doubted that the new target would \u201callow the E.U. to meet its long-term target of virtually eliminating carbon emissions.\u201dThe deal also included a clause \u2014 demanded by nations like Hungary that are concerned about their global competitiveness \u2014 to reconsider the carbon reduction target if an ambitious international treaty is not reached next year.But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, both suggested that the target would not be adjusted downward no matter the outcome of the United Nations talks next year.The United Nations has been pressing for a climate deal that will require significant action by major economies like the United States and the European Union, as well as China, India and Brazil.The major polluting nations will most likely set their targets in the first half of next year. It remains unclear what they will look like.But even as the European Union has tried to pave the way by setting its climate targets early, experts said they may not be as ambitious as they first appear.The deal requires a 40 percent cut in emissions from levels in 1990, a period when carbon pollution from European coal plants was at high levels. In the United States, President Obama is pushing policies to cut carbon pollution by 17 percent from levels in 2005, a year in which carbon pollution was much lower, according to Robert N. Stavins of the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements. The European Union deal could still top that, but probably by only a few percentage points using the 2005 benchmark.\u201cIt puts them once again in first place if there is a race to be out first \u2014 but the race between first and second place might be quite small, depending on baseline years,\u201d said Robert Stavins, director of Harvard University\u2019s environmental economics program.Curbing emissions that contribute to a changing climate has long been a popular cause in Europe. Policy makers here frequently highlight how their industries and citizens emit lower levels of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide than those of the United States and other industrialized countries.But recently there has been less enthusiasm among Europeans for a green agenda. The reasons include the stagnant economy that has depressed manufacturing, jobs and wages, and an unwillingness to adopt new regulations that could worsen Europe\u2019s declining international competitiveness. There have also been reductions in funding for green projects, and concerns about nuclear energy as an alternative since the disaster at Fukushima, Japan.In addition, there has been diminished interest in identifying renewable alternatives, given the advent of technologies to extract cheap shale gas despite its uncertain prospects in Europe.European leaders have also been a bit more reluctant to take steps against climate change since a climate conference in Copenhagen ended in failure five years ago.The talks were \u201cnot easy, not at all,\u201d said Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, the body that represents European Union leaders.The result was an overall package that was significantly weaker than what countries like Germany and Sweden had been seeking.A target of generating at least 27 percent of its energy from renewable sources will be binding at the European Union level, but not at the national level. That raised questions among climate experts about how the target would be enforced.A separate target for improving energy efficiency by at least 27 percent was \u201cindicative\u201d only, meaning it would not be binding even at the bloc level. The target also was lower than the 30 percent proposed by the European Commission.But the outcome suited David Cameron, the British prime minister, who had been concerned that binding targets on renewable sources and energy efficiency would give ammunition to his political opponents who contend that he has surrendered too much sovereignty to Brussels. Climate goals could now be accomplished at \u201cthe least cost to our industries, at the least cost to our consumers, and the least cost to families up and down Britain who don\u2019t want to pay any more on their energy bill than they otherwise should have to,\u201d Mr. Cameron said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Respect Is Bestowed on Fiscal Policy", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 With the shadow-boxing between France and Germany about European Union budget rules now over, with the Federal Reserve announcing an end to its bond purchases in the United States and with the Japanese government about to confirm its planned increase in consumption tax next year, macroeconomic policy all over the world is entering a period of unusual predictability. Rightly or wrongly, the major advanced economies have reached a settled view on their economic policy choices and are very unlikely to change these in the next year or two, whether they succeed or fail. It therefore seems appropriate to consider what we can learn from all the policy experiments conducted around the world since the 2008 crisis. The main lesson is that government decisions on taxes and public spending have turned out to be more important as drivers of economic activity than most economists expected and probably more powerful than the monetary experiments with zero interest rates and quantitative easing \u2014 buying bonds with newly created money \u2014 which have received much more attention. Moreover, fiscal policy decisions have often operated contrary to the rhetorical predictions of politicians and central bankers. Countries that took emergency measures to reduce public borrowing have mostly suffered weaker growth, as in the case of Britain from 2010 to 2012, Japan this year and the United States after the 2013 \u201csequester\u201d and fiscal cliff deal. In more extreme cases, fiscal tightening has plunged countries such as Italy and Spain back into deep recession and aggravated financial crises. Meanwhile, countries that ignored their deficit problems, as did the United States for most of the post-crisis period, or where governments decided to play down their fiscal tightening plans, as did Britain this year or Japan in 2013, have generally done better, in terms of both economics and finance. The one major exception has been Germany, where budgetary consolidation has managed to coexist with decent growth, largely because of a boom in machinery exports to Russia and China. That boom is now over, pushing Germany back into the recession that its stringent policy suggested all along. Thus the six years since 2008 have provided strong empirical support for the supposedly outdated Keynesian view that government borrowing is at least as powerful as monetary policy in stimulating depressed economies and pulling them out of recession. Recessions generally occur when private businesses and households decide to spend less than their incomes to reduce their debts or increase their savings.If this process of \u201cdeleveraging\u201d is happening in the private sector \u2014 which it clearly has been \u2014 then simple arithmetic shows that economic balance can be restored only if some other sector of the economy spends more than its income. Disregarding the role of exports and imports, which must balance out to zero for the world as a whole, the government is the only possible candidate to play the crucial balancing role of the \u201cother sector.\u201d It is therefore a mathematical certainty that governments must increase their borrowing whenever businesses and households decide to spend less than they earn. Despite this indisputable arithmetic, there has been surprisingly little interest in the macroeconomic effects of budgetary decisions. In contrast, there are endless debates about every twist and turn of monetary policy. The explanation lies in the standard economic models of the pre-crisis period. When monetarism replaced the Keynesian thinking that dominated policy making from the 1930s to the 1970s, economists simply assumed that in recessions, interest rates would fall sufficiently to stimulate private investment and discourage excessive private savings. As a result, the private sector as a whole would never suffer for long from a shortfall in spending, and government borrowing would never be needed to balance low private demand. As a result of these assumptions, interest rate decisions by central banks came to be seen as the only effective tool of macroeconomic management. Tax structures and public spending levels were seen as supply-side issues; whether government borrowing expanded or contracted, interest rates would rise or fall to offset the Keynesian demand effects. Independent central bankers would manage macroeconomic demand with monetary policy, leaving governments to set taxes and spending plans to achieve political or supply-side objectives. This era of monetary dominance ended with the 2008 financial crisis, but many economists and politicians have not yet noticed. Once interest rates fell to zero, traditional monetary management lost its ability to provide further stimulus. And now that central banks are providing \u201cforward guidance,\u201d which commits them to very low interest rates for years to come, monetary policy has also lost its ability to offset fiscal easing and restrain demand. As monetary policy has lost traction, fiscal policy has automatically gained power. With interest rates at or near zero, private demand cannot be stimulated with further rate cuts. This means that monetary easing can no longer offset fiscal tightening. As a result, any reduction in budget deficits becomes unambiguously deflationary, which is why the French and Italian governments were right to resist enforcement of the German-inspired fiscal compact in the eurozone. Conversely, fiscal expansion now provides an unqualified economic stimulus because there is no risk that interest rates will rise significantly in the next year or two \u2014 and perhaps not until the end of the decade. In short, the world has returned to a period of fiscal dominance, as in the 1950s and 1960s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Modi Fails, So Far, to Return Illicit Funds to India", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From IndiaNEW DELHI \u2014 Thousands of years ago in India, \u201ca plastic surgeon, perhaps,\u201d fixed an elephant\u2019s head on a boy who had lost his, Prime Minister Narendra Modi revealed on Saturday in a Mumbai hospital, which does not offer such a service yet. He was not saying that ancient Indians were negligent when choosing head donors, but that Indians were once so great that the things they did were like magic.The prime minister need not have searched so far.Millions of modern Indians have the ability to make money invisible. A large part of the Indian economy, though nobody is sure just how large, officially does not exist, but it exerts an unmistakable influence on the visible world. Illicit money, which is income that has been earned through illegal means or evaded taxes, has a dual life in general Indian perceptions.Most of India\u2019s middle class, especially entrepreneurs, deal in it in some form and view it as a practical necessity to make a profit in a country where the cost of doing business is high. But they view larger, more organized hoarders of illicit cash as criminals. There is a perception that the big fish smuggle the money out of India.There is no evidence to suggest that most of India\u2019s illicit money is outside India rather than within, but Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party exploited that perception when it campaigned on the promise that it would bring back all the money that Indians had squirrelled abroad as a part of its war against corruption.The party claimed that trillions of rupees were lying in foreign banks and that it would get the money back to India within 100 days of assuming power.More than 150 days have gone by, but Mr. Modi has yet to show Indians the money. What his government has instead is a list of Indians with foreign bank accounts, not all of them dubious. On Monday, it released the names of a few account holders whom it accused of hoarding illicit money abroad.The list was a disappointment, at least to those who had assumed that Mr. Modi was serious about his war on what Indians call \u201cblack money.\u201dMr. Modi and his party during campaigning had Indians believe that several prominent politicians, especially from the rival Indian National Congress party, had money stashed away in foreign banks. But the names that were released on Monday were of little-known businesspeople. Two of them had made donations to both the B.J.P. and the Congress party.The government indicated that it could not reveal all the names as it was constrained by the legal arrangements it has with the countries that shared the information. But, on Tuesday, the Supreme Court rebuked the government for protecting the shady, and gave it one day to submit the list of names to it in a sealed envelope, which the government has now done.This is the new government\u2019s first fiasco, because it has come across as an ally of the big players in the shadow economy, exactly what it had accused the previous government of.If it is true that the government wants to protect some powerful Indians, then the Supreme Court intervention, though embarrassing, is in fact very convenient. The government has been relieved of the responsibility of revealing the names itself.Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party, who ran for office against Mr. Modi in the general elections, implied in a written statement that the government was shielding those who had financed its expensive election campaigns while unleashing tax raids on the less useful.Two years ago, Mr. Kejriwal released a list of Indians who he claimed had suspect foreign bank accounts. The list included Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s richest man, who is believed to be very close to Mr. Modi.In fact, it was in a hospital run by Mr. Ambani that the prime minister fondly remembered the ancient plastic surgeon who had fixed an elephant\u2019s head on a boy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Warns of Inequality Threat", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, used her bully pulpit on Friday to sound the alarm about rising economic inequality.Ms. Yellen did not mention recent market turmoil or monetary policy during her 30-minute speech. Instead, she painted a bleak picture of the increasingly unequal distribution of wealth and income, warning that Americans already have relatively little chance to advance economically, and that the problem may be worsening.Ms. Yellen, who took office in February, continues to put her stamp on the Fed by raising the profile of issues related to economic inequality. Beyond the Fed\u2019s efforts to increase job growth through stimulative monetary policy, Ms. Yellen sees a role for the central bank as a source of research intended to provoke public debate.Some Republicans in Congress argue the Fed\u2019s recent activism is harmful to the economy, and they are seeking to impose new legislative restraints.\u201cIn today\u2019s highly partisan political environment, policy issues \u2014 and the politicians who talk about them \u2014 are inevitably perceived through partisan lenses,\u201d said Ms. Binder, who studies the central bank. \u201cI suppose that is the risk for Yellen speaking out on an issue that is more often framed as a Democratic issue.\u201dBut some audience members Friday welcomed what they saw as a change in tone.\u201cIt shows you how she thinks of her role as Fed chair,\u201d said Nick Perna, an economist who heads Perna Associates, a consulting firm in Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s not only lip service to the dual mandate but an obligation to promote opportunity. And she\u2019s the first Fed chair that has really gone out of her way to emphasize it.\u201dMs. Yellen on Friday focused on four sources of economic opportunity: the means to raise children, access to education, owning a small business and inheritance.She said recent Fed research showed the distribution of those opportunities to be increasingly unequal. For example, the share of wealth held by the lower half of households fell from 3 percent in 1989 to 1 percent in 2013, according to the Fed\u2019s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, a survey of 6,000 households.Government benefits and public programs offset some of that inequality, but Ms. Yellen noted that public financing for early education had not increased since the recession, while the cost of higher education continues to rise.\u201cI fear the large and growing burden of paying for it may make it harder for many young people to take advantage of the opportunity higher education offers,\u201d she said.Similarly, she noted that the decline in small business creation suggested that it had become harder for people to build wealth through entrepreneurial risks, threatening \u201cwhat I believe likely has been a significant source of economic opportunity.\u201dInheritances were the somewhat surprising bright spot in her bleak picture. Ms. Yellen said that wealth gains from inheritances were less concentrated than overall wealth. Large numbers of less affluent families continued to receive windfalls. The average age for receiving an inheritance is 40, the Fed found, a stage of life when people are often assessing their ability to pay for children\u2019s education or to start a business.Ms. Yellen noted that inequality could contribute to economic growth by serving as an incentive. But it can also make things worse, she said. She pointed to a relationship she described as the \u201cGreat Gatsby curve\u201d \u2014 that in advanced economies with greater inequality, there is also less opportunity for intergenerational mobility. And mobility, she said, \u201cis lower in the United States than in most other advanced countries.\u201dMs. Yellen offered few specific suggestions on addressing these problems.She also did not discuss the view of some critics that the Fed\u2019s own policies are part of the problem. Before the recession, the Fed placed greater priority on reducing inflation than on reducing unemployment. More recently the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign has raised the value of financial assets, which are primarily held by affluent households.\u201cLarge-scale asset purchases seem to widen income inequality, although this is challenging to quantify,\u201d Yves Mersch, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s executive board, said in a Friday speech that expressed a common view.Fed officials have said any such impact is outweighed by the success of the stimulus program in creating new jobs, raising home values and increasing growth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Worth of Black Men, From Slavery to Ferguson", "Date": "2014-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayThe paper, stained in spots, has yellowed, its black ink faded to a dull brown, but the horizontal lines printed on the page are still a fine blue. Some scribe took great care preparing this page, first dragging a piece of graphite along a straight edge to make two pairs of twin columns. Sometimes the pencil marks skip, disconnecting from the line before joining the page again. Once ordered, the table received its data: numbers rendered by hand but with a machinelike uniformity.One column is titled \u201cAges \u2014 Years Old\u201d; the other, \u201cValuation.\u201d The first begins in infancy at age 1 and continues to 60, the age of infirmity for an enslaved person after a lifetime of work. In the second column, corresponding prices ascend steadily, beginning with the youngest slave, valued at $100, and climbing by increments of $25 or $50. The chart peaks at age 20 and $900. From there it descends, by the same increments, until ending with the 60-year-old slave worth only $50. This is the \u201cScale of Valuation of Slaves,\u201d from the papers of Tyre Glen \u2014 a prosperous North Carolina slave trader and tobacco planter who was, paradoxically, also an abolitionist and antisecessionist.The economist Robert Evans Jr. noted in 1962 that \u201cthe slave market performed for the antebellum South some of the functions now performed by the New York Stock Exchange, i.e., it served in the eyes of the public as a sensitive reflector of current and future business prospects.\u201d Calculating the profitability of slaves as compared with other investments circa 1850, Evans estimated that the purchase of 1,000 20-year-old male slaves \u2014 held for 20 or 30 years and accounting for standard rates of depreciation and death \u2014 was greater than investments such as the \u201cthree- to six-month bankable paper money market in Boston,\u201d or stock in the Northern and Southern railroads.No mathematical equation exists to produce the economic model that ends with 18-year-old Michael Brown, shot multiple times with his hands in the air, his lifeless body left in the street for four hours. The numbers will inevitably be run, however, to determine the cumulative cost of damages owed to owners of property looted or destroyed in the riots engulfing Ferguson, Mo., after Brown\u2019s death, thus fulfilling a ritual cycle enacted repeatedly over the last 100 years: injustice, outrage, appeals to peace, reprimands against violence and looting and then insurance claims.But a path can be traced from slavery to the killing of Michael Brown. The sociologist Lo\u00efc Wacquant asserts that racialized slavery was only the first in a series of \u201cpeculiar institutions\u201d (as went the 19th-century euphemism gilding the nation\u2019s founding contradiction) to enforce caste and class in the United States. The most recent is the \u201chyperghetto\u201d and \u201chyperincarceration\u201d that presides today, wherein there\u2019s little hope of mobility and uniformly dire possibilities. Instead of being at the center of the national economy \u2014 as were 20-year-olds in slave traders\u2019 value scale \u2014 those who are young and black have become a distortion of the \u201cextra man\u201d: They are now surplus labor, discarded in advance as uneducable, unredeemable criminals or potential criminals.#BlackLivesMatter, the hashtag slogan that emerged amid the outcry against Brown\u2019s killing and other similar deaths, has predecessors in previous eras. The abolitionist\u2019s plea went \u201cAm I Not a Man and a Brother?\u201d (this was amended by Sojourner Truth to \u201cAren\u2019t I a Woman?\u201d in her challenge to early gender-equality advocates who denied the participation of black women). In the era of Jim Crow terrorism, the N.A.A.C.P. regularly suspended a flag from the window of its New York headquarters declaring, \u201cA Man Was Lynched Yesterday.\u201d The pointed and similarly plain slogan \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d was emblazoned on the posters of Memphis sanitation workers on strike in 1968 during what would be the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s final campaign. (At an auction of African-American ephemera, I once saw an original of that poster, which had been altered by its owner. I AM A MAN, the poster stated. \u201cNOT-A-BITCH,\u201d was the scrawled annotation.)But who is addressed by these claims \u2014 left as the impression of a wax seal or unfurled on a flag; carried as placards on bodies or appended to 140-character shards of thought? All address a great unnamed They: the system, the state or, more hopefully, the people and the democracy. (In 1900, the anti-lynching advocate Ida B. Wells-Barnett, in her preface to \u201cMob Rule in New Orleans\u201d exhorted, \u201cWe do not believe that the American people who have encouraged such scenes by their indifference will read unmoved these accounts of brutality, injustice and oppression.\u201d) We are speaking to one another, ourselves against the possibility of our own forgetfulness; we are addressing future histories. The artist Dread Scott recently plastered a series of fake \u201cwanted\u201d posters around Harlem challenging, among other things, the civil rights violations of New York\u2019s much-criticized stop-and-frisk police tactic. Featuring generic police sketches of the young black and Latino men disproportionately targeted by the practice, the posters offered another take on the value of these lives, stating \u201cthe suspect is wanted by his family, friends, and neighbors.\u201dToday the chorus of voices declaring #BlackLivesMatter also speaks to the militarized police forces gathered to contain revolt, mourning and rage. They speak to the courts who will later hear arguments of defense: The gun was used by accident instead of a Taser (as in the killing of Oscar Grant III in Oakland, Calif.); the victim was in possession of weaponized concrete (as in the killing of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla.); the possibly imperiled young woman at the front door in the dead of night was a menace in need of immediate extermination (as in the case of Renisha McBride in Dearborn Heights, Mich.). Two trials were required to bring justice for Jordan Davis, murdered in Jacksonville, Fla., because his \u201cthug music\u201d was too loud. For John Crawford III, killed in the pet-food aisle of a Beavercreek, Ohio, Walmart, there will be no hearing, for a grand jury has decided not to indict the officers responsible. In very many other similar instances, the vigilante or \u201cjustified\u201d or \u201cofficer-involved\u201d homicides do not receive media attention. According to a report issued by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, at least one black person is the victim of \u201cextrajudicial killing\u201d every 28 hours in the United States.How do we make sense of all these killings? By the logic of Tyre Glen\u2019s chart, then the deaths of all these extra men and extra women, and once-prime men and once-prime women are entirely sensible. The scholar Sabine Broeck suggests we understand slavery not as \u201csafely entombed . . . deplorable events in the past,\u201d but as enslavism \u2014 \u201cthe legacies of which are ongoing.\u201d The bloody inversion of a bloody history arrives at these black lives dispatched with ease. The last few years have seen scores of memorials, re-enactments, monuments and editorials coinciding with the sesquicentennial of various events of the Civil War. But it is these deaths \u2014 the killings in Ferguson and Beavercreek and beyond \u2014 that commemorate the unfinished, perhaps unending, struggle to assert black humanity in a country built on its denial.Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts is the author of \u201cHarlem Is Nowhere: A Journey to the Mecca of Black America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brooklyn Inspires African Artists", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAPE TOWN \u2014 Brooklyn may be 7,816 miles away from Cape Town, but the New York borough has inspired a new show at Stevenson Gallery here called \u201cKings County,\u201d which opened last week and runs through Nov. 22.The gallery, which opened in the art-meets-design district of Woodstock in 2003, represents a wide range of contemporary African artists focused on the continent itself: from Anton Kannemeyer\u2019s darkly satirical comics to Pieter Hugo\u2019s unnerving photographs. This year the gallery participated in Frieze New York, is currently at Frieze London and will be at Paris Photo and Art Basel Miami Beach.For its latest show, the gallery wanted to focus on geography and its limitations, said the curator and gallery director Joost Bosland in a recent interview. Mr. Bosland had been in talks with the gallery\u2019s artists \u2014 including Njideka Akunyili Crosby, Meleko Mokgosi, Wangechi Mutu and Paul Mpagi Sepuya \u2014 individually about where they each live and how that influences their work, but the show didn\u2019t materialize until Mr. Bosland realized that all four artists had one thing in common: Brooklyn.\u201cThe artists in this exhibition are all, in different ways, invested in this imaginary place called Brooklyn, and use the idea of the borough as a backdrop to the making of their art,\u201d said Mr. Bosland. The show spans installation, video, work on canvas and work on paper by the artists, who have all lived in Brooklyn (called Kings County by Dutch settlers in the 17th century). \u201cWe have two works by Mr. Meleko, one video by Ms. Mutu, four works on paper by Ms. Akunyili Crosby and a room installation containing 20 photographs by Mr. Sepuya,\u201d Mr. Bosland said.For these artists, Brooklyn is a rich source of inspiration, from its new creative economy, to its immigrant history and recent gentrification. \u201cEach person had their own unique relationship with the place,\u201d said Mr. Bosland.The show also came about in part because of Mr. Bosland\u2019s chance encounter with the Brooklyn-based Nigerian writer Teju Cole on a balcony in Lagos.Mr. Bosland recalled, \u201cTeju spoke very passionately about Brooklyn as the only place in the world where he does not, in one way or another, stand out.\u201dMr. Cole, who wrote an original piece for the exhibition, said, \u201cWhen I\u2019m in Brooklyn, at least in certain parts of it, I feel that no one can walk up to me and demand to know what I\u2019m doing there.\u201d He added, \u201cAnywhere else in the world, even in Lagos where I grew up, I\u2019m not so sure \u2014 I have a metaphysical confidence in the place.\u201dOne of the artists, Meleko Mokgosi, 33, from Botswana, is known for his large-scale project-based installations often focusing on the perception of historicized events; his view of Brooklyn is focused on a specific area, Sunset Park. \u201cCrucially, it is a workspace, and I feel comfortable getting off the train every day at 8 a.m. and heading to work alongside the numerous factory workers going in the same direction; so no mystery, suspense or romanticism here \u2014 its just work,\u201d Mr. Mokgosi said.For the mixed-media artist Njideka Akunyili Crosby, 31, the coexistence of universality and difference that exists in the city is often portrayed in her work: from intimate scenes of lovers to Nigerians dancing at house parties, all done in various collages. Her work explores how young cosmopolitan Nigerians maintain their Nigerian identity even as they integrate into foreign communities across the world. \u201cBrooklyn reminds me of home (Nigeria) \u2014 both are spaces of constant cultural negotiation made up of cultural imports due to globalization,\u201d Ms. Akunyili wrote in an email. The appeal also lies in the fluidity of cultures. \u201cPeople with many differences \u2014 not only cultural, but also racial, national, class, level of education, age, etc. \u2014 exist next to each other and so Brooklyn creates its own new and unique cultural space,\u201d she added.According to Mr. Bosland, the show is all about the significance of geography \u2014 something that galleries from outside Europe and the United States \u201ccannot avoid whether they want to or not.\u201d He continued, \u201cIn a sense Brooklyn becomes a mirror for our own continuous negotiation of being from elsewhere.\u201dThis group show is a first for the artists at the Stevenson Gallery although they have individually been exhibiting worldwide. Wangechi Mutu, 42, a Kenyan sculptor and artist, has exhibited widely, and just opened a solo show at Victoria Miro in London. Ms. Akunyili Crosby, Mr. Mokgosi and Mr. Sepuya have primarily exhibited in the United States. Mr. Sepuya\u2019s self-published photographic periodical entitled \u201cSHOOT,\u201d which started in 2005, is available worldwide.\u201cIn 10 years, the more interesting story could be the Bronx, or Newark. But that\u2019s the way of the world,\u201d Mr. Cole said. But for now, he added, \u201cwe need a place like Brooklyn to exist, a place of dedicated cosmopolitanism and insistent tolerance.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture credit with this article misstated part of the attribution.

{"Headline": "The Age of the Resilient Traveler", "Date": "2014-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: A Cut AboveChris Brown, 50, is on a quest and he is not going to be deterred by global turmoil, terrorist threats or the risk of deadly disease.Mr. Brown\u2019s mission is to visit every country in the world. Recent stops included Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan. Kenya is next on his list, despite numerous governments\u2019 warnings about terrorism \u2014 he wants to see Maasai warriors on the plains.\u201cHow mind-blowing is that?\u201d said Mr. Brown, a British native who works in the oil and gas industry. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I want to see it. But I do want to see it and I will see it.\u201dIn his own way, Mr. Brown represents the hearty spirit of modern international travelers. A resilient group, they continue to explore, visit and wander, defying headlines, regional strife and, in some cases, common sense.This past summer, travelers faced myriad horrific images: videos of beheadings, the aftermath of a plane mysteriously disappearing from the sky and continued violence in the Middle East, to name a few. Logically, it was a good summer to stay home and remodel the backyard.Yet more people traveled abroad this summer than a year earlier, with the number of international passengers up 5.5 percent in July, according to the International Air Transport Association. In the first six months of the year, 517 million tourists visited a foreign land, an increase of 22 million from a year earlier, the World Tourism Organization said.On one level, the growth in air traffic simply reflects improving economies around the world, industry analysts say. But clearly, some other element is in play, driving people to travel despite peril around the world.Modern travelers are managing their fears better than their squeamish predecessors, psychologists say.\u201cPeople are increasingly finding ways to deal with it,\u201d said Elaine Iljon-Foreman, a clinical psychologist based in Britain, who often works with travelers who fear to fly. \u201cWe are living in times of threats, but it\u2019s about how we manage it and how we decide not to allow this to limit our freedom.\u201dBelkis Santos is certainly nothing like the adventurous Mr. Brown. She is a retired educator living in Chicago, who likes to travel with her daughter or small groups.But like Mr. Brown, she has not let the headlines deter her from traveling around the world. Ms. Santos\u2019s recent itinerary included lengthy trips to South Africa and South America, and she lives part time in Panama.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to die, you\u2019re going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t read and they don\u2019t know and they are afraid of everything.\u201dThe instant availability of research, data and reviews on almost any topic has changed the psyche of travelers, experts say. More than ever before, people can gather information on their own to assess the perceived risk.Paul Johnson, 43, author of a luxury travel blog, is no danger seeker. But he is part of a vast network of bloggers and information sites, which made it easier for him to hop on a plane recently to destinations such as Lithuania and South Africa.When it comes to concerns, \u201cI think it does naturally seep into your consciousness,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cBut people need to look into the detail. It boils down to education and your ability to educate yourself about a destination.\u201dThe availability of information also provides a coping mechanism for the anxiety associated with travel in tumultuous times, experts say. Modern travelers can create a wall between their own experiences and television images.\u201cEvents are happening to other people,\u201d said Robert Bor, a British specialist in aviation psychology. \u201cThey distance themselves from world events. It\u2019s appalling stuff, but it\u2019s out there.\u201dBy all accounts, those anxiety levels should be at an all-time high. The act of traveling itself is more stressful and annoying than ever, surveys suggest, with the initial hours of an international trip already providing a harrowing journey of lengthy security checks, grumpy attendants, overbooked flights and frequent delays.\u201cMost of it is quite unpleasant,\u201d Mr. Bor said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously coping and managing that experience. We\u2019re adapting.\u201dData shows that the international travel phenomenon is not limited to one region or one sector. Despite new communication technologies and tight budgets, global business travel spending is expected to hit a record $1.18 trillion in 2014, a 6.9 percent increase from 2013, according to Global Business Travel Association. Over all, the Americas, Europe and Asia all reported increases in arrivals of 5 percent to 8 percent over the previous year, according to World Tourism Organization data. The biggest increases in visitors were in Southeast Asia and Northern Europe, but travelers did not completely avoid hot spots. More than 160,000 people visited Israel as tourists in August, according to government data \u2014 a 32 percent decline from a year earlier, but still a sizable group of travelers who were willing to ignore the recent violence in Gaza.Pim Ruig, a travel consultant in Los Angeles, booked a couple this year for a honeymoon in Thailand, shortly before a military coup there in May. She offered to cancel the trip, but the couple stuck to their plan. \u201cThey were \u2018We\u2019re 100 percent going,\u201d\u2019 said Ms. Ruig, who was born in Thailand.Ms. Ruig finds clients receptive to detailed information from her friends and relatives in Thailand, offering the pros and cons of the situation. Clients \u201care totally willing to listen,\u201d Ms. Ruig said. \u201cThey are dying to go. They want to see something exotic.\u201d This streak of independence is part of a well-documented shift taking place in travel habits, as people look for a different type of experience, something beyond the mass tourist destinations, said Douglas Quinby, director of research for PhoCusWright, a market research firm that tracks the travel industry.\u201cIt\u2019s not just travelers who want to see Paris,\u201d Mr. Quinby said. \u201cThey want to have a different type of experience than the bus tours their parents took.\u201dLudmila Yamalova-Davis, 39, who was born in the Soviet Union, grew up in the United States and now is based in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, has vacationed in Iran, Thailand and Bangladesh in recent years with her husband, Glen. Traditional destinations no longer interest her.\u201cThe whole draw is not staying at another nice hotel or eating at another nice restaurant,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole attraction of travel is to experience something different.\u201dMs. Yamalova-Davis has traveled to remote regions in Pakistan and braved tensions to explore old villages in northwest and central Iran in search of what she calls \u201cauthentic\u201d destinations, untouched by Starbucks franchises and other Western influences. \u201cThey\u2019re getting harder to find,\u201d she added.At a certain point, the rewards of travel outweigh the risks for many people, experts say. Travelers want to take the trip; they need to take the trip.\u201cWe are wired to be explorers,\u201d said Dr. Alice Boyes, a Las Vegas-based author who writes about anxiety. \u201cThe broader goals are more important than the anxiety. People manage anxiety with the purpose of the trip.\u201dEfforts to determine the actual benefits of travel have produced volumes of research papers and debate, but few specific answers. Some studies suggest the benefits of travel are not necessarily long lasting. Like an adrenaline rush, the relaxation of the trip quickly fades.But there are long term effects, the ability to break away from daily life and experience new cultures, that are harder to measure.\u201cThe thing that does last is the memories, the experiences, the emotional development,\u201d said Ms. Iljon-Foreman, the clinical psychologist. \u201cMemories are building up and are a quality that lasts.\u201dTravel industry executives fear that the patience of the resilient traveler may be tested further and numbers could start to decline.\u201cThe risks that could derail this trajectory\u201d cannot be ignored, International Air Transport Association said in its recent report. \u201cThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa, weakness in the eurozone, hostilities in Eastern Ukraine and instability in the Middle East loom large.\u201dBut that\u2019s not going to stop Mr. Brown, who says the compulsion to travel is in his blood.\u201cI think it\u2019s innate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you either are born with it or you learn it at an early age. Or you don\u2019t get it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Melanin-challenged visitors and residents tend to be professionals, diplomats, United Nations types or safarigoers \u2014 people with means. Tell Kenyans that there are white people who sleep in rags on the sidewalks of America and most shake their heads and laugh in disbelief.But Kenya\u2019s business landscape is changing at dizzying speed. International franchises, some with imported labor, are racing to set up shop here \u2014 Subway, Domino\u2019s, Cold Stone Creamery and other big worldwide brands that had stayed away from this region but now want a piece of East Africa\u2019s fast-growing pie.\u201cWe did essentially zero marketing, and it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d said CJ Bak, the developing agent for Subway in Kenya, with three stores currently and plans for 20.On good days, Mr. Bak said, each location can get 500 customers. The biggest seller? The chicken teriyaki sub.Nothing, though, may signify that Kenya has arrived more than the sight of a white man with a bead of sweat trickling down his temple, hustling trays of drinks and sweeping up steak scraps with the edge of his hand.The other night Caramel featured a hostess from Las Vegas, a leggy bartender from San Diego, a chef from Goa, Mr. Mileveski and another young man from Macedonia. The foreigners made up a small percentage of the total staff but were definitely the most visible. Some said they were here for just a short time, to train Kenyans; others said they planned to stay awhile.\u201cI see job in Internet, I come Africa,\u201d said Nenad Angelovski, the other Macedonian import, whose English was not nearly at the level of the Kenyan waiters. \u201cI like Africa. I like adventure.\u201dThere have previously been a handful of Westerners running restaurants here, the occasional Italian ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel or Israeli manager helping bring a hot plate to a table or making a wine suggestion. But when Caramel opened in September, the word quickly spread: mzungu waiters, mzungu waiters. Many Kenyan customers said it was the first time they ever had their dirty dishes cleared by a white person.\u201cWe never had anything like this in Nairobi,\u201d said Cecilia Wairimu, a well-known Kenyan singer who recently dined at Caramel. \u201cI think it\u2019s awesome.\u201dJim Moaddab, the chief operating officer of the Caramel Group and an American, said Kenya was \u201cthe perfect investment landscape\u201d because of its \u201cstrategic location, natural assets and human resources.\u201dWhat had been holding back international franchises, entrepreneurs said, were supply chain issues. It is often difficult to meet Western consistency standards in a place where the power goes out regularly and machete-wielding mobs occasionally barricade highways, interrupting the supply of fresh beef.Mr. Bak still struggles with his brown bread; the dough somehow changes from day to day and sometimes refuses to rise.Cold cuts are also an issue, so scarce and expensive in Kenya that the $9 price of a footlong roast beef sub at a Subway in Nairobi is actually slightly higher than the cost of the same sub in many stores in the States. And that\u2019s ignoring the fact that the United States\u2019 per capita income is more than 40 times Kenya\u2019s.Mr. Bak cited the example of McDonald\u2019s passing out potato seeds to Indian farmers years before the first McDonald\u2019s opened in India, to make sure there would be a steady supply of perfect potatoes for McDonald\u2019s fries.\u201cYou can make that kind of investment if you\u2019re going to open hundreds of stores,\u201d Mr. Bak said. \u201cHere, it\u2019s much smaller, so most of the franchises are not corporate-owned.\u201dStill, he predicted that with population growth charts showing that almost two billion babies will be born in Africa in the next 35 years, soon enough \u201ceveryone will be here,\u201d meaning McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Walmart and all the major American chains.Fast food in Nairobi used to be chicken and chips from a local spot like McFrys or barbecue at a roadside thatched-roofed shack. To outsiders, it might seem a shame to have a part of the world so full of its own charm get sucked into the homogeneity of everywhere.But few Kenyans seemed upset about that.\u201cIt\u2019s better for everybody, because it\u2019s top quality,\u201d said Simon Kamau, a Kenyan businessman who has lived in America.\u201cPopeyes, man,\u201d his eyes glowed wistfully. \u201cI bet people here would love that!\u201dStep into a Subway in Nairobi and it is as if you are leaving Kenya, or entering the new one. The glass doors are so clean you could easily knock your forehead into them, the floors are mopped spotless, the air redolent of freshly baked bread. The racks of warm chocolate chip cookies are right next to the cash register, just where they should be.Of course, there are some local touches, like the squishy little bottles of fresh passion fruit juice for sale. And the man making the subs was a little heavy on the sweet onion sauce.Caramel is in a mall, ABC Place, which just underwent a face-lift. Sleek elevators open into a corridor where men in black suits frisk visitors. A long illuminated table glows near the bar, and in the back are reservation-only \u201ccabanas\u201d where couples nuzzle next to flickering propane lamps.One Kenyan couple on a recent evening seemed amused by the mzungu factor.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to work,\u201d said the female patron, who asked not to be identified because she knew one of Caramel\u2019s investors. \u201cWhere else in this country are you going to get a mzungu waiter?

I\u2019m sitting in what must have been some tycoon\u2019s corner office. Four overstuffed chairs are surrounded by a full complement of hipster eclectica, from art books to lava lamps.My hosts are not squatters. They are Nathan Blecharczyk, a 30-something co-founder of Airbnb, and several of his fellow executives. Airbnb is the start-up Internet marketplace that matches visitors to cities around the world with people who have space to rent in their homes. In just six years, the business has exploded: It is currently valued at roughly $10 billion and employs more than 800 people. What made these people start Airbnb? For a sure way to make a boatload of money? Not likely. According to Scott Shane, an entrepreneurship scholar at Case Western Reserve University, about a quarter of new businesses typically fail in their first year, and fewer than half are still standing after five years. A smart guy like Nate could find a career with much better odds of financial success.Indeed, a few minutes with him dispels any delusion that money is all he cares about. To hear him tell it, he started the business because it was fascinating and fun. And most of all, he says, because it could help ordinary people who needed an affordable place to stay or had some excess capacity in their homes. That\u2019s right \u2014 Nate sees Airbnb as a \u201chelping industry.\u201dSome will howl at this, because we tend to define helping industries as things like government, charities and health care. But are those the only ways \u2014 or even the best ways \u2014 to help struggling Americans? Government and charities play an important role, especially in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and our subsequent nonrecovery. But let\u2019s use a bit more imagination, and turn our attention back to Airbnb.Ordinary people, especially vulnerable people without power and privilege, find Airbnb empowering and useful. It lifts Americans up with zero cost to the taxpayer. And people like it. Shouldn\u2019t we encourage this? Nobody wants zero regulation, and every company should follow the law. But policy should begin with admiration for new ways that citizens can build their lives, not with hostility to profits or the impulse to protect entrenched industries. Governments have their own golden opportunity to exercise creativity in service of the common good, whether that entails rethinking anachronistic zoning laws or adjusting tax policies that treat someone\u2019s spare bedroom the same as a Marriott suite.Any of us can work in a helping industry. That includes teachers, nurses, stay-at-home parents, entrepreneurs who want to empower ordinary people, and government officials who welcome novel industries as opportunities to evolve instead of nuisances to be squashed.The blessing of our free enterprise system is that any of us can sanctify our work. We just need to ask if what we are doing truly lifts others up.Arthur C. Brooks, a contributing opinion writer, is president of the American Enterprise Institute. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Listings Mostly Illegal, New York State Contends", "Date": "2014-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAirbnb, the pioneering home rental service, presents itself as useful and virtuous, but the reality is far less benign, according to a report that Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, released on Thursday.Property owners on Airbnb are indeed making money, but it is not being spread around. Most rentals are in three high-profile Manhattan neighborhoods. Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island barely figure.Airbnb declined to aggressively dispute the numbers in the report, which draws on four years of data it provided to the attorney general after a court fight.\u201cWe need to move forward,\u201d an Airbnb spokesman, Nick Papas, said. \u201cWe need to work together on some sensible rules that stop bad actors and protect regular people who simply want to share the home in which they live.\u201dAirbnb, which is most likely contemplating a public offering in the next few years, seemed eager to avoid another fight. Its latest round of fund-raising put its valuation at $10 billion.The housing broker and its imitators, like the taxi service Uber and its clones, have been prompting upheaval just about everywhere they go.Admirers say these stars of the so-called sharing economy are breaking up monopolies that have grown greedy and lazy. They are empowering individuals. Critics say that the start-ups are unsavory efforts to avoid regulation and taxes, and that the very term \u201csharing economy\u201d is ridiculous.In some contentious spots, like San Francisco, where the local government endorsed a plan last week to essentially legalize Airbnb, a resolution may be in sight. But in New York, where real estate is often viewed as a blood sport, the battle is only deepening.Mr. Schneiderman and city regulators will also announce Thursday a joint enforcement initiative to shut down illegal hotels. Various regulators will investigate violations of building and safety codes and tax regulations.\u201cAnyone operating an illegal hotel should be on notice that the state and city will take aggressive enforcement actions in this area,\u201d said Mr. Schneiderman. \u201cA slick advertising campaign doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is illegal activity.\u201dHe was careful, however, to speak of \u201cillegal hotels\u201d rather than \u201cillegal rentals.\u201d Airbnb is already too popular to dislodge completely, no matter what the housing laws say. It also delights travelers, who get a cheaper and usually more interesting place to stay.\u201cMost of our hosts are regular New Yorkers, and the overwhelming majority live outside of Manhattan,\u201d Mr. Papas said.As for the 72 percent of listings that Mr. Schneiderman said were illegal, Mr. Papas said it was hard to tell what was going on.\u201cEvery single home, apartment, co-op and living space in New York is subject to a myriad of rules, so it\u2019s impossible to make this kind of blanket statement,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThat kind of uncertainty and lack of clarity is exactly why we\u2019re advocating for clear, fair rules for home sharing.\u201dThe report, Airbnb in the City, draws on anonymized data on 497,322 private stays in 35,354 unique places that were for less than 30 days and did not involve a shared room.The report said the service was dominated by large-scale operators, finding that 6 percent of the hosts made 37 percent of the revenue \u2014 or $168 million. The number of units they administered ranged from three to 272. The individual with those 272 units charged an average of $358.19 a night, yielding $6.8 million, the report says.Some of these operators may be gone already. In April, in the midst of Airbnb\u2019s negotiations with Mr. Schneiderman over turning over its data, the company said it was expelling hosts with 2,000 listings in New York because they \u201cweren\u2019t providing a quality, local experience to guests.\u201dSome of the large-scale operators that remain are as upset with Airbnb as they are with Mr. Schneiderman. Over a hundred hosts were told by Airbnb over the summer that Mr. Schneiderman had requested information about them, and that the company would turn over the data unless a court prevented it.A group of the hosts has now filed a lawsuit against Airbnb under the name New Yorkers Trying to Make Ends Meet in the Sharing Economy.\u201cIt is not O.K. for a website that has gathered sensitive personal and financial data in order to market and profit from short-term rentals to turn around and hand this private data over to a politically motivated attorney general, simply to save its own hide,\u201d said the president of the group.He declined to be identified because he said it would make his properties a target for the regulators. All his units are legal, he said.A Quinnipiac poll last month revealed sharp divisions among New Yorkers about companies like Airbnb. Asked whether city residents should be able to rent rooms to strangers like a hotel, 56 percent of the respondents said yes and 36 percent said no.\u201cAirbnb allows longtime residents to stay in their homes by earning just a little extra money to help make ends meet,\u201d the company states in its promotions. It stresses that only 18 percent of its New York rentals are \u201cwhere the hotels are,\u201d which it defines as Midtown. The other 82 percent are \u201coutside of traditional tourist zones.\u201dBut the attorney general\u2019s report says rentals in three areas in Manhattan \u2014 Lower East Side/Chinatown, Chelsea/Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Greenwich Village/SoHo \u2014 accounted for 40 percent of private stay revenue, or $187 million.Reservations in Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx accounted for only 3 percent, or $12 million.The report also indicates that an increasing number of units were being rented out on a more or less permanent basis. While still small in absolute numbers \u2014 about 2,000 units are rented for six months of the year or more \u2014 affordable-housing advocates have warned that this trend could push up prices for long-term residents as units disappear from the housing stock.A dozen buildings had 60 percent or more of their units used as rentals for at least half the year, \u201csuggesting that the buildings were operating as de facto hotels,\u201d the report says.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aviation Giant Is Nearly Grounded in Ukraine", "Date": "2014-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few derelict airplanes sit along the weed-choked apron connecting its huge construction hangars; cats saunter through the muted assembly shops; flight simulators sit empty.The crisis with Russia that erupted in February terminated Antonov\u2019s most promising, albeit already troubled, joint venture: a short-takeoff, heavy-lift plane that the Russian military had sought for years.Antonov was not alone. With the rupture, Ukraine, among the world\u2019s top 10 arms exporters, lost the market that spurred the development of its military industry.Economic and military experts said Antonov\u2019s troubles epitomized the twin problems plaguing state-run companies in Ukraine, particularly the military sector, as it tries to slip Russia\u2019s gravitational pull and hitch its fortunes to Europe.First, Ukraine inherited flagship industrial plants like Antonov with the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, but neither the government nor the companies tried to reorient sales. Russia remained the primary focus, so this year\u2019s rift set scores of companies adrift.Second, state-run firms never abandoned their love of central planning. Antonov and other companies avoided shattering the Soviet organizational model, still awaiting state requisitions. Even now, experts noted, Antonov is locked in a bitter, paralyzing court battle over which arm of the Ukrainian bureaucracy controls it.\u201cAntonov is Ukraine\u2019s calling card. It built the most powerful transport planes that beat all the world records,\u201d said Valentyn Badrak, an independent Ukrainian military analyst. \u201cLosing it would be like cutting off an arm.\u201dThe government should sell shares and order many planes to ensure that Antonov survives, Mr. Badrak said, adding: \u201cThe issue of developing Ukraine\u2019s aircraft industry is beyond the capacity of Antonov\u2019s management. It depends on the government.\u201dYet, at just under 50 percent, government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product is among the highest in the world \u2014 and an indication of how far the government has to go to establish something like a free-market economy.Antonov might be considered Exhibit A of the problems Ukraine must overcome.Oleg Antonov, a Russian flight enthusiast, organized an airplane design company owned by the Soviet state in 1946 and directed it until 1984. He had a knack for making hardy passenger planes that could survive crude, often unpaved Soviet airfields. The Soviet government asked him to create military transport planes, and for a time, Antonovs formed the bulk of the fleet.In the 1980s, two planes \u2014 first the Antonov-124 Ruslan and then the even bigger Antonov-225 Mriya \u2014 lifted record-breaking cargoes. With their trademark open noses, they have transported rockets and railroad cars and battle tanks. Designed as the Soviet Union waned, only one AN-225 was ever built.While design was done at the Antonov complex in Kiev, production was scattered across the former Soviet Union. (Antonov did not start building planes commercially until 2009, when the government merged it with a failing state-run aircraft builder.)Lately, though, the company has fallen on hard times. By its own account, Antonov built just four airplanes last year: three small passenger jets for Cubana, Cuba\u2019s national airline, and one for North Korea\u2019s Air Koryo. So far this year, it has delivered only two more small planes to Cuba.Six planes in various stages of construction sit in the vast assembly hangar here, but the company is unsure about buyers for most of them. Despite the slowdown, it still has 13,000 employees of its own, while an estimated 70,000 Ukrainian workers at other factories build parts for it.Antonov was supposed to test a prototype of a new transport plane, the AN-178, in 2014, but has yet to receive the engines, which are made elsewhere in Ukraine. The company would be better off buying engines outside Ukraine, Mr. Badrak and others have said, but powerful business interests blocked that.Antonov employs some impressive engineers who rattle off complicated technical data in fluent English, talking about digital design and composite fuselage materials. Yet the place exudes a certain retrograde air. In the assembly hangar, the black phones on the work tables have rotary dials.Some Antonov traditions endure. Small passenger jets like the AN-148 still sport engines mounted about a yard higher than Western airplanes, to avoid sucking debris off the ground.\u201cRussia, China and Kazakhstan have a lot of not-so-good airfields,\u201d said Viktor N. Kazurov, the project manager for the AN-148, noting the design would be useful for bad runways anywhere.Company officials talk about seeking new markets and cashing in on its high international profile, and some years ago, Antonov did license a plant in Iran to make small passenger jets. But it has been slow to develop new customers, experts said.The defense industries in Russia and Ukraine remained interdependent after the Soviet Union collapsed, and right up until this year, raw materials and manufactured parts flowed back and forth across the border. Ukraine built few wholly independent weapons systems. At this point, Russia and Antonov still could not build planes without the other, experts said.The Kremlin first announced in the 1990s that Russia would produce all military equipment domestically, but it never did. The country received 4 to 7 percent of its military supplies from Ukraine annually. Trade continued unabated this year, even after Russia attacked Ukraine\u2019s Crimea Peninsula.Finally, on June 17, the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, ordered all military sales to Russia halted.In its best year, 2013, Ukraine\u2019s state-run military enterprises sold nearly $2 billion in arms globally, Mr. Badrak said. Russia bought 15 percent, the third-leading customer after China and Pakistan. Sales by private companies added even more.Perhaps most important, Ukraine manufactured critical, technically complex equipment for Russia that cannot be rapidly duplicated \u2014 helicopter engines, gas turbine engines for warships and key missile components, as well as Antonov aircraft designs.Yet the Kremlin, Antonov executives say, wanted to maintain ownership of the advanced designs, even though they were developed by the company. The history of the ill-fated Antonov-70 \u2014 a four-engine, wide-body military transport plane \u2014 illustrated the problem.In development for more than two decades, the plane endured several design phases as Russia asked Antonov repeatedly for changes like more modern avionics. Eventually Russia committed to buying 60 aircraft, and the Ukrainian military ordered two. Production was to be divided between both countries. But disagreements continued to plague the venture, so it was suspended 18 months ago, said Dmytro S. Kiva, 71, the current Antonov president.The root problem was that Russia wanted to own the intellectual property rights for a plane that Antonov designed. \u201cThey wanted to control it,\u201d Mr. Kiva said. \u201cThey saw Antonov as part of the Russian Federation.\u201dCritics say Antonov is now on life support, living off the $200 million in revenue earned annually by a subsidiary that leases giant AN-124 transport planes to NATO and other customers.The company conceded that the leasing revenue is important, but said it earned between $300 million and $400 million annually from leasing and other activities, and that trade with Russia accounted for just 10 percent. Antonov still builds civilian aircraft jointly with Russia.What Ukraine really needs, many experts said, is a different mind-set, particularly in the estimated 40 percent of economic production that the state runs.\u201cMany of those old-style managers are unable to accept the reality,\u201d said Pavlo M. Sheremeta, who resigned as Ukraine\u2019s minister of economy in August over the slow pace of reform. \u201cThey would cry and shout and yell, \u2018Support us, don\u2019t cut the ties, don\u2019t be enemies with Russia,\u2019 as if we annexed Russian territory.\u201dAntonov, at a time when experts believe it should be focused on finally escaping its Soviet past, instead captured headlines in September when a president newly appointed by the Ministry of Industrial Planning summoned the police to try to force his way into the plant past employees who liked their current boss and wanted a voice in choosing any new leader.In a management dispute worthy of \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d the company maintains that the Ministry of Industrial Planning \u2014 its very name redolent of Soviet ways \u2014 cannot appoint a new president because the agency was abolished after the February revolution.The government gave it three months from March to conclude its affairs, but Oleksandr F. Kalenkov, the acting minister, said last month that he needed up to a year to officially hand over the 140 or so companies it runs to the Ministry of Economy. He was removed from his post on Oct. 1. The confrontation now sits in Kiev District Administrative Court.Asked about the dispute, Dmytro Shymkiv, appointed in July to coordinate all government reform efforts, consulted a list of ministries on his tablet. The Ministry of Industrial Planning no longer existed, he confirmed.Mr. Shymkiv then conceded that there might be a gap between the decree and reality. \u201cWhen you have a transformation like this in the country, you will have a lot of cases like this,\u201d he said. He called Antonov too strategic to privatize.Valeriy V. Migunov, a spry, 78-year-old retired test pilot, still acts as a consultant for Antonov. Wandering among the quiet flight simulators, he waxed nostalgic about past decades, starting in the 1960s, when Antonov\u2019s first wide-bodied transport planes created global buzz.\u201cAn ordinary company could not build such aircraft,\u201d said Mr. Migunov, who was named a \u201cHero of the Soviet Union\u201d in 1984. After some prodding, he acknowledged that he was having trouble accepting that Antonov was severing ties with Russia. \u201cI feel a certain amount of personal discomfort,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the type of plane that Antonov leases to a subsidiary for $200 million annually. It is the AN-124 transport plane, not the AN-224.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Good Buddy, Bad Buddy", "Date": "2014-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 THE biggest story in Rhode Island this fall isn\u2019t the potential election on Nov. 4 of the state\u2019s first female governor, Gina M. Raimondo, a Democrat, or its first Asian-American governor, Allan Fung, a Republican. Instead it\u2019s the improbable comeback of Buddy Cianci, the felonious former mayor of Providence, who spent two decades in City Hall and is now running for yet another term. Hailed as a savior, condemned as a sinner, the 73-year-old is a fractured city monument who could steal the epitaph from H. P. Lovecraft\u2019s tombstone at Swan Point Cemetery: I am Providence.As Buddy\u2019s unauthorized biographer, I have long been fascinated by his enduring appeal, and what it says about American politics. Elected in 1974 as the anti-corruption candidate, Mr. Cianci was forced to resign in 1984 after a felony assault conviction for that incident with the cigarette, came back in 1991 and was forced to resign again in 2002 after another felony conviction, for racketeering conspiracy. He belongs to that great American pantheon of rogues whose corruption was tolerated because of their populist appeal to voters and the perception that they \u201cgot things done\u201d \u2014 Boss Tweed, Huey Long, James Michael Curley, Edwin Edwards.His seventh run for mayor is an irresistible story, one that has drawn the national news media back to Providence. Years ago, when a TV reporter asked Mr. Cianci what he thought of the media circus at his racketeering trial, he quipped, \u201cAre you calling yourself a clown?\u201d The mayor in fact had a real clown on the payroll, to entertain at his grandchildren\u2019s birthdays. An aide justified the use of campaign funds by explaining that children are future voters. And so they are. Mr. Cianci, who leads a former housing court judge, Jorge Elorza, in the polls but must convince undecided voters troubled by his criminal past, told me that he would win because of all the voters who remember his coming to their Little League games. When I was a young reporter at The Providence Journal, I remember Mr. Cianci pulling up to my friend\u2019s backyard cookout in his police-chauffeured limousine and staying past midnight.A city is like a woman you make love to, he once said. But he was an unfaithful lover. Beneath the shiny veneer of the Providence Renaissance lurked an \u201cI know a guy\u201d culture where a young man paid $5,000 to get a job as a city planner, a man with a criminal record paid $5,000 to get into the police academy and people paid bribes to purchase vacant city property or get a break on their property taxes, while honest citizens struggled to find work and pay taxes.City workers and vendors were pressured to donate to Friends of Cianci. Streets were in disrepair while Cianci henchmen with nicknames like Buckles and Blackjack stole asphalt and even manhole covers to sell as scrap metal. Minority groups complained of police brutality, while cops loyal to Buddy spied on his political enemies, cheated on promotional exams and couldn\u2019t account for cocaine and gold that disappeared from the evidence room. Schools lacking money for textbooks and repairs spent $1 million to lease an auto body shop as a student registration center from a felon. One witness recalled carrying a shopping bag of \u201cscarole\u201d \u2014 Italian slang for money \u2014 to City Hall.Mr. Cianci could be charming, but he could also be a fearsome bully. The owner of a popular restaurant told me that Buddy called in the Fire Department to shut his place down one night in the \u201990s, displeased that a new bouncer demanded a $2 cover charge. When the restaurateur went to City Hall to plead his case, he said, Mr. Cianci accused him of selling drugs in his club and warned, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get into a pissing match with me, because you\u2019re a cup of water, and I\u2019m Niagara Falls.\u201d The man relocated to New York.So why is Buddy still so popular, at least among the 38 percent of voters who say they support him, and the police, fire and teachers unions that endorsed him? For some, it\u2019s his larger-than-life persona, like his oversize campaign signs, obscuring the past. For others, it\u2019s nostalgia and dissatisfaction with the present, when Providence is nearly broke. (A situation that can be traced in part to generous public pensions given out by Mr. Cianci.)Perhaps Buddy said it best. A former aide once told me he often joked, \u201cIf the people of Providence could read, I\u2019d never get elected.\u201dI recently spoke to a man who works for the city. Mr. Cianci sought his support, advising, \u201cThe train is leaving the station.\u201d The man declined, and later spoke with a Cianci supporter who said he\u2019d better watch out if Buddy won.Businesspeople say they\u2019ve gotten calls urging them to meet with Buddy. Some won\u2019t speak out publicly, for fear of retribution. But they worry that the new businesses Providence needs to revive its economy will steer clear if Mr. Cianci returns.Mac Farmer, a downtown lawyer and ex-councilman who was an ally, then an adversary, of Buddy\u2019s, was once warned by the mayor not to have a drink and then back out of his driveway. But he told me his grown daughters now urged him to meet with Mr. Cianci; they remember his taking them for rides on a police horse. Mr. Farmer says Mr. Cianci hasn\u2019t taken enough responsibility for corruption on his watch. He wonders if the Bad Buddy would once again overwhelm the Good Buddy. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he\u2019ll be able to control that,\u201d says Mr. Farmer. \u201cHe has to persuade people that he\u2019s a safe bet \u2014 that he\u2019s not the same old Buddy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Campaigning to Extend, or End, One-Party Rule ", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAITKIN, Minn. \u2014 As he steps to front doors along the winding roads here in his rural House district, State Representative Joe Radinovich announces that he is there to introduce himself, and \u201cin case you want to yell at me about something.\u201dThere is reason to anticipate yelling.Now Mr. Radinovich, 28, is facing the same Republican rival he defeated by just 323 votes in 2012, and his opponent is mounting a blunt, aggressive campaign accusing Democrats of overreaching.\u201cThe only thing people are more disgusted with than deadlock in St. Paul is one-party control in St. Paul,\u201d said Dale Lueck, 65, a Navy retiree who raises beef cattle and is Mr. Radinovich\u2019s challenger. \u201cEven people who thought that was a good idea at one point have come to be concerned about the kind of excesses that happened,\u201d Mr. Lueck said the other day, then rumbled off in his white pickup to knock on more voters\u2019 doors.Twenty-three states are now controlled by Republicans, and 13 by Democrats, the most states under single-party rule in six decades.With Mr. Obama\u2019s poll ratings poor and midterm elections traditionally favoring the party that does not control the White House, Republicans are hoping to add Iowa and Arkansas to the states entirely under their control as well as to break the Democrats\u2019 lock on power in places like Colorado and here in Minnesota.Democrats view the governors\u2019 races in Wisconsin, Kansas and Michigan as among their best hopes of defeating a Republican incumbent and regaining at least some voice in those Republican-held state capitals, and are pouring energy and money into final efforts to get out the vote.\u201cThe last two years were the most active policy-making years in states in years,\u201d said Tim Storey, an elections analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures. \u201cAnd in some places I think voters may be saying, \u2018Well, wait a minute, I think we need divided government or maybe some more balance here.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWith more than 6,000 state legislative elections, dominance in about 15 state legislative chambers might shift and the parties are fighting strategically for the few seats that would allow them to take control of a legislative chamber \u2014 and either gain single-party control or, in more cases, end it for the other party. Republicans have their eyes on upper houses in Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Nevada and Oregon, and lower houses in Kentucky, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico and West Virginia. Democrats say they see possibilities for taking control of State Senates in places like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Washington and New York (where Republican-led coalitions are now in control), and houses in Arkansas and Michigan.In Michigan, Democrats are pouring in far more resources than they did in 2010 for get-out-the-vote efforts to defeat Rick Snyder, the Republican businessman-turned-governor, while also pressing to take the State House, which Republicans control by nine votes. \u201cThe voters have a serious case of buyer\u2019s remorse right now,\u201d said Lon Johnson, the chairman of Michigan\u2019s Democratic Party, ticking down provisions passed since Republicans took full control there in 2011: prohibiting requirements that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment, taxing retirees\u2019 pension income, and increasing regulation of abortion facilities.But Dick DeVos, a leading Republican donor in the state who once ran for governor, said he believed that \u201cone team having the ball\u201d had proved its value in four short years, particularly given the state of the economy when the Republicans took over.\u201cIn Michigan, we were not at a time where we had to be careful about making mistakes,\u201d Mr. DeVos said. \u201cHaving partisan bickering and no action, we would have been stuck in Michigan for years. We didn\u2019t have time for that. We\u2019d be stuck in last place. Did they do it perfectly? No. Is it a better place? Yes.\u201dIn Colorado, where the Democrats won full control in 2012, there has already been fallout. Two Democrats were removed in recall elections in 2013, cutting the party\u2019s hold on the State Senate to a single vote, and Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, is fighting for political survival in a tight race with Bob Beauprez, a Republican. In the State Senate, Republicans have targeted eight seats in the hope of gaining some say \u2014 though by no means complete control.\u201cIt shortens the rudder,\u201d Senator Bill Cadman, the Republican minority leader, said of the prospect of divided government. \u201cYou can\u2019t take massive turns in extreme directions when the legislature\u2019s balanced.\u201dAfter Republicans took sole control of state government in 2012, the state took a sharp turn to the right, cutting taxes and business regulations, reducing unemployment benefits and allowing concealed guns in bars and restaurants.\u201cThe Hagan campaign has managed to make her federal election a referendum on the state legislature and education issues you usually don\u2019t see in these sorts of races,\u201d said Thomas Mills, a Democratic political strategist and blogger in Carrboro, N.C.Here in Minnesota, Mr. Lueck\u2019s is one of a handful of races Republicans are paying special attention to in a push to end the Democrats\u2019 lock on this state\u2019s capital, its first complete dominance over St. Paul in more than two decades. The State Senate is not up for election this fall, and polls have shown Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, ahead of his opponent, Jeff Johnson, a Republican, leaving Republicans to channel much of their attention on winning control of the House, which Democrats hold, 73 to 61.The fight has centered on a handful of House races in areas like the one around Aitkin \u2014 a district with a single stoplight and where a far quieter race was exceedingly close two years ago.Here, the Democratic Legislature\u2019s decision to approve same-sex marriage in 2013 raised eyebrows; a year earlier, a ballot measure amending the State Constitution to define marriage as between a man and woman failed statewide, but was supported by more than 60 percent of voters in this district. Mr. Radinovich voted to legalize same-sex marriage.\u201cOur state has turned into a little Obama playground,\u201d said Kari Abbott, chairwoman of the Aitkin County Republicans.

There\u2019s nowhere to work for men or families.\u201dMs. Bullied\u2019s emotional fatigue is a shared condition, with Americans crawling back from the Great Recession, conflicted about new military involvement in the Middle East, and blaming their elected leaders for their fate.Her southwest corner of Pennsylvania was the birthplace of the Big Mac in 1967, a time when the local economy hummed and the middle class prospered. Now, some of the houses on the tranquil, tree-lined streets here seem to sag forward slightly \u2014 a metaphor for the collective sentiment that better days may not lie ahead.Interviews with more than five dozen voters from Maryland to Missouri revealed a weary electorate, and one with a shaky grip on the American ethos of a brighter future just around the corner.Many were angry with President Obama, whom they described as a failed leader. They said they had seen very little change and were fast losing hope. And even those who supported the president spoke of his unrealized potential \u2014 though they placed the blame with the world of partisan politics he inherited, saying he was doing the \u201cbest he can\u201d (Springfield, Ill.) or \u201cas good as can be expected\u201d (Terre Haute, Ind.).Their sentiments about Congress, with the midterm elections less than a month away, were unambiguous and harshly negative.A DisconnectWHEELING, W.Va. \u2014 Danny Swan, 27, stood in front of his Grow Ohio Valley farm stand \u2014 a white bucket brimming with freshly picked blueberries, and cardboard boxes stuffed with peppers, tomatoes and corn \u2014 and talked about how all the politicians in Washington were \u201cplay acting,\u201d busy \u201cputting on a show to entertain the rest of us, right next to People magazine on the newsstand.\u201dWe want to know: Do you plan to vote in this year\u2019s midterm election? If so, what issues are important to you and why? And if you don\u2019t plan to vote, why not?What they don\u2019t understand, Mr. Swan said, are communities like his, in the Ohio River Valley at the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.\u201cI want to see our political leaders standing out here with us, finding out: Why is it that our tomato crop failed this year?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can they do to help us next year? Why is it that the local print shop had to lay off 12 people this year?\u201dBut however disconnected voters feel from their government, their relationship with Washington is layered. While many, like Mr. Swan, blame politicians for their economic station, they also seem to be yearning for the government to help.\u201cI work six days a week, nine and a half hours a day, and I still struggle to pay my bills and make sure that my son has,\" said Janette Rideoutt, 38, who manages a clothing store here. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand, because they have money, and when you have money, it just makes life a little bit more simple.\u201dOut for a motorcycle ride in Terre Haute, Rick Poole, 56, said that as a truck driver in the oil fields of North Dakota, he felt lucky to have a stable job. But he added that Washington politicians were living in a bubble in which \u201cthey have no idea what it\u2019s like to be out here and having to work for minimum wage of $8 or $9 an hour and try to raise a family.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Poole said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re going to have to work 60, 70, 80 hours a week just to keep your head above water, what kind of life is that?\u201dHere at HomeINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Diana Warren knows that, as she put it, \u201c9/11 was brought to us.\u201dBut now, 13 years after the World Trade Center fell, she worries that Mr. Obama is \u201ctoo busy with foreign things and foreign policies.\u201d\u201cI know some of them foreign countries need help, but I can\u2019t see sending billions of dollars over there when they\u2019re cutting off people\u2019s unemployment here,\u201d said Ms. Warren, 50, a waitress from St. Clairsville, Ohio.Such sentiments popped up repeatedly along the National Road, which predated the construction of the Interstate System. The overarching view: \u201cGet home down, and then you can worry about everything else,\u201d said Weldon Clark, a 19-year-old sophomore at Indiana State University.The appeal was echoed from east to west. An Ohio police officer passing through Maryland on a motorcycle worried that the money and troops the president had sent to the Middle East were not \u201cmaking us any safer.\u201d And a St. Louis woman out for an after-dinner stroll said it was time to accept that \u201cthe days of the United States as a superpower are over.\u201dBut for those who would like to see the United States play a larger role abroad \u2014 to see Mr. Obama take on a more muscular stance as commander in chief \u2014 the frustration is no less intense.Heather Lopez, a church worker in Terre Haute, Ind., echoed many voters who argued that Mr. Obama was not a strong leader, saying, \u201cHe talks like he\u2019s neutered.\u201dSo, what would Ms. Lopez like to see happen?President ObamaCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Six years into Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, the litany of complaints against him runs deep.From a retired woman in downtown Columbus: \u201cLousy. Inefficient. He\u2019s just not there.\u201dFrom an optometrist taking a break at a Dairy Queen in Terre Haute: \u201cTerrible. Poor. He\u2019s basically enabling socialism.\u201dAnd from Ms. Lopez, the church worker, who said she got much of her information from Fox News: \u201cI think a monkey could do better. Daffy Duck could do better. And your average housewife without a high school education could do better.\u201dBut conversations with voters revealed another, perhaps quieter, group of Americans: those who voted for Mr. Obama and still want him to succeed, even as they resign themselves to a more narrow definition of success.While his opponents criticize both what they see as his lack of leadership and his use of executive actions to circumvent Congress (\u201cKing Obama,\u201d one joked), the president\u2019s supporters argue just the opposite: that Mr. Obama is but a mortal, with real limits (partisan rancor, world events, bitter opposition) on what he can do.\u201cI think he wants to improve things, but he\u2019s the president,\u201d not a wizard, said Derrick Terrell, 55, in Columbus. \u201cHe can\u2019t wave his magic wand and have all our troubles go away.\u201dAmish Oza, 36, a doctor in Columbus, said he was eager to see how Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law played out. The president, he said, deserved more credit for putting the law in place.Others, too, were willing to give Mr. Obama the benefit of the doubt. Denise Schantz, striding through downtown Springfield, Ill., on her lunch break, pointed to the improving stock market and the recovering housing market in her area. \u201cI think President Obama is doing a great job,\u201d Ms. Schantz, 60, said with unabashed glee.\u201cHe inherited a big mess,\u201d she said, \u201cand he\u2019s trying to clear it up the best he can.\u201dOf RaceSPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2014 While Mr. Obama rarely speaks of it, the effects of race, real or imagined, on his presidency are on the minds of both black and white voters, who repeatedly brought up the issue as an explanation for why he has faced such opposition.Standing just blocks from the Illinois Capitol, where Mr. Obama got his political start, Denise Carter, 52, a restaurant hostess, pointed to her own brown skin to illustrate what she believed to be at the root of the president\u2019s problems.\u201cA lot of people do not like taking command from a black man,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cThat\u2019s all there is to it.\u201dShe cited Mr. Obama\u2019s methodical, \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid stuff\u201d approach to foreign policy as an example. \u201cIf there was, for instance, a Caucasian man or anybody else,\u201d she said, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t have none of the problems that he\u2019s having, just because of the color of his skin.\u201dMark Vidor, 63, a retired social worker who now passes his time as a street accordionist in Towson, Md., also said he believed there was \u201can underlying racial aspect\u201d to the way Mr. Obama had been received.Ms. Carter said that as much as the country pretended to be colorblind, race remained a significant \u201cstumbling block\u201d for the president.\u201cWalk a mile in our shoes, which you can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there he is.\u201dCondemning CongressST.

{"Headline": "Jobless Rate in U.S. Falls Below 6% as Hiring Picks Up", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive years after the nation emerged from a crippling recession, the economy finally appears to be on track for a more robust recovery, bolstered by strong recent job gains and an unemployment rate that dipped below 6 percent in September for the first time since the summer of 2008.But the surprisingly rosy jobs report released by the government on Friday appeared to be too little, too late to bolster the prospects of Democratic candidates facing voters in struggling campaigns for next month\u2019s midterm elections in the face of rising disenchantment with President Obama\u2019s performance.And the signs of improvement were tempered by evidence that wage gains remained meager and that millions of Americans were still so discouraged by their job prospects that they had lost contact with the regular employment system.President Obama, visiting an automotive steel supply company in Indiana, seized on the strong jobs numbers as evidence that his economic policies had helped spur the recovery.\u201cThere is a lot of good stuff happening in the economy right now, but what we all know is, there are still some challenges,\u201d Mr. Obama said.September\u2019s unemployment rate was 5.9 percent, down from 6.1 percent in August.Mr. Obama blamed Republicans for obstructing his proposals to help ordinary Americans. \u201cToo much of the growth in income and wealth is going to the very top \u2014 not enough of it is being spread to the ordinary worker, and that means that we\u2019ve still got some more work to do to put in place policies that make sure that the economy works not just for the few, but it works for everybody.\u201dThe nation added 248,000 jobs in September across almost all sectors of the economy, according to the Labor Department, which also revised what had originally been a discouraging August report, now estimating that 180,000 jobs were added that month. The latest gains put 2014 on pace to be the best year for job growth since the late 1990s, when Bill Clinton was in office.The private sector has now added 10.3 million jobs over 55 straight months of job growth, a record that White House economists trumpeted in their own analysis of the data.September\u2019s report seemed even brighter against a global backdrop of stagnant economies in Europe and Japan and disappointing growth in China and other emerging markets.The strong showing on Friday was the last monthly jobs report before next month\u2019s midterm elections. But voters\u2019 opinions on the economy tend to lag considerably behind the actual numbers, so political analysts warned against expecting any huge improvement in mood in time for the voting. If the gains continue, however, they could help lift President Obama\u2019s party in 2016.For Democrats, there was also a dark underbelly in Friday\u2019s bright news. The employment rate among the constituents they need most on Election Day \u2014 women, young people and black voters \u2014 did not improve in September. Nor did the numbers of people employed part time because they could not find full-time work.The actual percentage of working-age people with jobs \u2014 59 percent \u2014 has not changed for four months, a reflection of just how many people have stopped looking for work. In statements on Friday, Republicans blamed Mr. Obama\u2019s economic policies for leaving the labor participation rate at its lowest level since 1978.Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said the president\u2019s leadership \u201chas held our economic recovery back\u201d and that Wall Street was the only sector that was thriving.\u201cHard-working Americans want to know when the recovery is finally going to come to their street,\u201d Mr. Brady said in a statement.Adding to the gloom, average hourly earnings are stuck in the mud, down slightly in September and up only 2 percent in the last year, barely ahead of inflation.Economists said the slow pace of wage gains despite the sharp drop in the unemployment rate was a continuing puzzle that would test the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to balance its interest in promoting broad-based prosperity against the responsibility to curb the risk of future inflation.Political consultants had thought opinions this year could shift more quickly, given how social media, cable news and information sources saturate the public consciousness. But Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who teams up with William McInturff, a Republican pollster, on polling for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, said the severity of the Great Recession had proved such predictions wrong.As for news of the recovery, Mr. Hart said in describing a typical voter\u2019s reaction, \u201cWhat you\u2019re telling me is the water in my basement has dropped a third, but what I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ve got water in the basement.\u201dIn August, Mr. Hart and Mr. McInturff released polling that found four in 10 Americans had been directly harmed by the recession caused by the financial crisis of 2008. What is worse for Democrats, political independents \u2014 the most coveted voters \u2014 were hit hardest of all. Fifty-one percent of independents said either they or a member of their household had lost a job in the last five years, compared with 39 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats.\u201cThe political zeitgeist that needs to change,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster working on several congressional campaigns, \u201cis not that the economy is in good shape but that the president is fighting hard to create jobs.\u201dSecretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez focused on the overall picture, saying Friday\u2019s report proved wrong the pundits who had predicted prolonged further unemployment.\u201cThe challenge is to continue the pace of job growth and ensure these rising tides lift all the boats,\u201d he said.After recent dips in the markets, investors were encouraged by the job figures. Stocks moved higher and the dollar rose against many major currencies. Another bright spot on Friday was news that the trade deficit narrowed slightly in August, defying economists\u2019 expectations.With consumer confidence generally growing and business investment showing strength, many analysts are optimistic that in the next six months the economy will strengthen further.A sign that hiring is likely to continue to pick up is that the average workweek in manufacturing rose to 42.1 hours in September, near its highest level in more than 60 years. The average workweek across all sectors rose to a postrecession high.But 4.8 million workers are missing from the job force, neither employed nor actively looking for work. Some of that is attributed to demographics: As the large baby boomer population ages, many in that generation will leave the work force. But the participation rate for Americans 25 to 54, considered prime working age, is also at troubling levels.The latest jobs data is likely to sharpen a debate among Federal Reserve officials about how long to wait before beginning to raise interest rates. The Fed has held short-term rates near zero since 2008 to stimulate the economy.Fed officials, like many economists, are having a hard time judging the health of the labor market. The unemployment rate is falling toward the range that Fed officials regard as normal more quickly than they had expected. Most Fed officials predicted last month that the rate would be no lower than 5.9 percent at the end of the year \u2014 the level achieved in September. But the 2 percent rise in hourly wages over the last 12 months suggests that hiring was still unusually easy for companies.Some Fed officials argued even before the September jobs report that the central bank was retreating too slowly. James B. Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said on Thursday that the Fed\u2019s bond-buying campaign, expected to end this month, had stimulated job growth beyond expectations. As a result, he said, the Fed should not wait until the middle of 2015 before raising rates.But the latest data is unlikely to shift the majority of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee from the view that patience is the best policy. The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said last month that she still saw clear problems in the labor market, and that the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign was helping to ease them.And as long as inflation stays sluggish, officials say they see relatively little risk. Most say they would rather err on the side of pushing a little too hard to create jobs than retreat too soon.An earlier version of this article misstated the most recent point, before last month, at which the unemployment rate was below 6 percent. It was July 2008, not June 2008.Binyamin Appelbaum and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "About 25 Europe Banks Are Said to Have Failed Tests", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe results of the review, set to be disclosed Sunday at noon in Frankfurt, are being closely watched to determine whether Europe is finally taking the necessary steps to repair its dysfunctional banking system.The yearlong review is part of a broader effort to remove the uncertainty in the market that has hindered lending and weighed on the region\u2019s troubled economy. But the findings could unsettle markets if they show that more eurozone banks are in trouble than expected.Europe was alight with speculation on Friday about verdicts on the financial health of the region\u2019s 130 largest lenders.The big question is which banks might fail the central bank\u2019s review and how much new capital might be needed for the banks to survive. Estimates of the capital shortfall varied widely, from about 10 billion euros, or about $12.6 billion, to as much as \u20ac50 billion.The central bank\u2019s review was based on figures at the end of 2013. Banks that have not passed muster and have not taken steps to shore up their finances will have nine months to top up their reserves. Otherwise, they risk being shut down.The central bank noted the results would not be final until approved by its governing council Sunday morning. \u201cUntil that time, any media reports on the outcome of the tests are by their nature highly speculative,\u201d it said.Banks were informed of the preliminary results of the review and stress tests on Thursday. They will not know for sure whether they passed or failed until Sunday, shortly before the public disclosure.Most analysts expected the shortfall to be relatively modest, in part because bankers have known for a year that the test was coming and have sold risky assets and raised more capital, money that is available to absorb losses and is crucial to a bank\u2019s survival in a crisis.\u201cThe number of banks that would need to raise additional capital will be limited,\u201d analysts at Barclays said in a note to clients on Friday. \u201cThis is due to the substantial pre-emptive measures that the banks have already undertaken.\u201dBetting on which banks would do better or worse than expected was rampant on Friday. Trading was suspended on Friday in shares of the Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena after they jumped more than 10 percent on the strength of speculation that the bank would fare better than expected under European Central Bank scrutiny.The larger question is whether the review, which included an audit of bank holdings followed by so-called stress tests of their ability to withstand a crisis, will remove doubts about the underlying health of eurozone lenders and make it easier for them to raise money that they can lend to customers.J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, was pessimistic about the effect that the review would have on the eurozone economy. The reason for declining credit in the eurozone is not that banks cannot lend, he said on Friday, but that businesses do not want to borrow.\u201cThe stress tests will help certain countries like Italy and Spain,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said in a meeting with a small group of journalists. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be a breakthrough for the whole eurozone.\u201dThere could be a sell-off in financial markets on Monday if the central bank uncovers a bigger capital gap than expected. But there is also a risk of a negative market reaction if the review appears to be too lax. Previous stress tests by other regulators gave stamps of approval to banks that later failed, undermining trust in the whole banking system.The European Central Bank has a strong incentive to be tough. It will become the overall supervisor of eurozone banks on Nov. 4, and needs to show it has the skills and backbone to do the job.\u201cIf convincing enough, the assessment can support sentiment, the eurozone economy and the banks,\u201d Suvi Kosonen, an analyst at ING Bank, said in a note on Friday.The central bank conducted the stress tests with the European Banking Authority, which will simultaneously release results on Sunday that include lenders in European Union countries that are not in the eurozone, like Britain and Sweden.Banks found short of capital will have two weeks to submit a plan to the central bank on how they will shore up their finances. Even banks that pass could find themselves under pressure to raise more capital, if they pass only narrowly. The audit will expose that banks may have been overvaluing their assets or failing to set aside enough money to cover bad loans.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Landon Thomas Jr. from New York.

{"Headline": "Web-Era Trade Schools, Feeding a Need for Code", "Date": "2014-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A new educational institution, the coding boot camp, is quietly emerging as the vocational school for the digital age, devoted to creating software developers.These boot camps reflect the start-up ethic: small for-profit enterprises that are fast (classes are two to four months), nimble (revising curriculum to meet industry needs) and unconcerned with SAT scores or diplomas. Most are expensive, but some accept a share of the graduates\u2019 first-year earnings or a finder\u2019s fee from employers as payment.Many boot camps are clustered in the South of Market neighborhood here, a center for software start-ups. But 60 such schools have been started across the nation since 2012, attracting students with the promise that anyone \u2014 even someone without a computer background \u2014 who works hard can learn enough to qualify for a job developing software in an industry desperate for programming talent.On one recent evening at Dev Bootcamp, where class officially ended at 6 p.m. and faculty members were long gone, a sixth-floor classroom was still humming at 9, filled with students sitting in pairs, working on their projects.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hours, it\u2019s exhausting, and each week I think I can\u2019t do it anymore,\u201d said Shakrah Yves, 31, who three months ago was working as a seamstress. \u201cBut each week I learn so much, and it\u2019s so exciting to be able to build your own app.\u201dMost boot camps charge $1,000 a week or more, and attract a mix of career changers \u2014 lawyers, consultants, artists \u2014 and students who left college to learn to code, looking for a fast track to a well-paying career.Anthony P. Carnevale, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce, said that in the old industrial economy such training took place on the job, but that today\u2019s economy relies on postsecondary schools to prepare young people for jobs. And most colleges have no ready niche for teaching students to write software.\u201cThis is too applied, too hands-on, too small-bite to fit easily into a college curriculum,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of it as a place where technology outruns education.\u201dMany schools offer discounts for women and minorities. Some accept fewer than 10 percent of applicants, culled through Skype interviews and coding exercises.Working 10 hours a day, boot camp students cover a semester\u2019s worth of material in four days, said Anne Spalding, who left a tenured computer-science post to teach at Dev Bootcamp.\u201cIt\u2019s a more engaging way to learn, through projects, and each group amazes me with their final projects,\u201d she said. \u201cMy goal is that in 10 years, the boot camp approach will be part of higher education.\u201dThe most selective boot camps claim job-placement rates of nearly 100 percent and average salaries of $85,000 to $100,000 (lower in New York than in San Francisco). But the numbers are self-reported, and some count temporary jobs and internships as employment.At some point, the market will be saturated, but for now the demand for skilled programmers is enormous.\u201cThere are almost five jobs for every one web developer,\u201d said Bethany Marzewski of Stack Overflow Careers, a computer job website. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the toughest job to fill.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a talent war, especially for people with a few years of experience,\u201d Ms. Ravasio said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to hire a couple of my classmates, but they all had jobs they were happy with.\u201dDev Bootcamp\u2019s students must spend nine weeks mastering fundamentals on their own before starting the nine-week residential program. A new group begins every three weeks, and students falling behind can repeat a three-week module for free.\u201cI was at the lower end when I started,\u201d said Ian Root, a former schoolteacher, recalling his Dev Bootcamp experience. \u201cI had to work 100-hour weeks here to keep up.\u201dNow an evening coach there, he sits calmly, waiting for students to approach, laptops in hand, seeking advice on where their code has gone wrong. Mr. Root looks hard at their screens, then makes a suggestion or sends them back a few steps.Mr. Root\u2019s group included a 20-year-old who had not finished college and a Harvard graduate who later returned to the same company where he had worked, but as a coder.Some boot camp students have already taken college computer classes, but realized that while they had learned a lot of theory and algorithms, they had not gotten fluency in Ruby or JavaScript, the programming languages favored by industry, or real experience in building things.Boot camp students spend time working in pairs at shared stations, taking turns as the \u201cdriver,\u201d who types lines of code, and the \u201cnavigator,\u201d who reviews the lines and suggests changes.\u201cIt\u2019s very impressive to put your life on pause and learn engineering in a boot camp,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boot camp engineers tend to be very sharp, very driven, very excited to be engineers.Many boot camps emphasize that software developers need more than technical expertise, and aim to develop students\u2019 ability to work with diverse partners and meet new challenges.\u201cWe do all kinds of crazy things to keep people in that beginner state, like teaching them lock-picking, origami and yoga,\u201d said Adam Enbar, president and co-founder of the Flatiron School, which he said admits about 6 percent of applicants.This summer, along with the regular class at Flatiron\u2019s Lower Manhattan headquarters, a mostly female group in Brooklyn took the course for free through a New York City job-training program.\u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic experience,\u201d said Kate Brender, a Barnard College graduate who majored in astrophysics and worked as a paralegal before participating in the Brooklyn program. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked logic, but I was surprised at how much I liked this.

And this week, the world economy looked far from perfect.That was the unnerving reality behind a whipsaw week on Wall Street that caused dramatic swings in the global markets for stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities like oil. The pattern continued on Friday with a 1.2 percent decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with all the losses concentrated in the last two hours of the trading day.The overall results for the week were hardly disastrous: The S.&P. closed the week down only 3.1 percent, and it is still up for the year. Oil prices closed the week at a four-year low, which, if anything, should prove welcome news for American consumers. A measure of how much stock market volatility investors expect in the future is still below its January level.Evidence that the global economy may be unexpectedly stalling has jarred prominent economists and policy makers gathered in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. At a conference on Thursday, Lawrence H. Summers, the former United States Treasury secretary who now teaches at Harvard, highlighted this concern.\u201cThe defining challenge of our time, economically, is secular stagnation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the risk of inadequate growth, leading to inadequate potential, leading to inadequate growth.\u201dPerhaps the most disconcerting aspect of the turbulence in the markets is that it was not driven by some single piece of surprising news, but rather by a slow gathering of evidence that the global economic outlook was gloomier than it had seemed.\u201cWhen you get such subpar growth, it doesn\u2019t take much to push individual economies \u2014 and the global economy \u2014 back into a downturn,\u201d said Stephen S. Roach of Yale University\u2019s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. \u201cThat\u2019s what investors are grappling with right now.\u201dThe situation that seems to concern investors the most is the threat of deflation \u2014 falling prices \u2014 which central banks are still struggling to avert after years of extraordinary efforts to grease the wheels of global commerce. While many of the headlines this week focused on the ups and downs of the stock market, the real action was in a wide range of indicators that pointed to falling prices and weakening demand.On commodity markets, the selling was furious for much of the week. Oil is now 19 percent cheaper than on June 30 and corn is down 35 percent since the spring. United States Treasury bonds now yield a mere 2.3 percent, down from 3 percent at the start of the year \u2014 even though the Federal Reserve is winding down its program of buying trillions of dollars in bonds and intends to raise interest rates next year.Based on bond prices, investors now expect inflation in the United States of only 1.6 percent annually over the next five years; German inflation is now priced in at only 0.4 percent. Both are well below the target of about 2 percent that central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic aim for.It is a reversal of the problems that have haunted the world economy over decades past.After years of economic policy focused on ensuring that inflation and budget deficits did not become too high, now policy makers are grappling with a situation in which they are at risk of becoming too low.Central banks, after years of ultralow interest rates, are finding themselves with limited tools to do much to encourage higher inflation. This week, the leaders of both the International Monetary Fund and of the European Central Bank \u2014 known for their commitment to fiscal caution \u2014 encouraged Germany and other countries with the room to do so to spend more money to help encourage growth.In part thanks to the efforts of the global central banks, prices for stocks and other financial assets have been on an upward tear for more than five years, with the S.&P. 500 index up 182 percent since March 2009. But valuations of many assets are now relatively high, even as the global economy remains somewhat shaky.Further economic weakening could prompt more slides in the stock and bond markets, which in turn could undermine economic confidence at a fragile time. And investors may be all the more jittery after riding the markets to giddy heights. Some financial experts have long argued that aggressive monetary stimulus has done a lot to drive securities markets higher but that its has not induced robust growth in the real economy.A pressing question is whether the American stock market and its economy can remain insulated if other parts of the world stall badly. Many economists contend that, in theory, there is enough strength within the United States to sustain the recovery.Falling oil prices, while they contribute to the deflationary force in the global economy, give American consumers more money to spend elsewhere. On Friday, the national average price for regular gasoline was $3.24, eight cents lower than a week ago and 19 cents lower than a month ago. A year ago, the price was $3.35.\u201cIt\u2019s been a wild two weeks for oil prices, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at GasBuddy.com. \u201cWe have nearly 20,000 stations in the nation now selling gasoline for $3 a gallon or less. We are looking at billions of dollars of savings for consumers compared to last year.\u201dThis is not the first time in the last few years that sluggishness in Europe and Japan has weighed on global growth. In the recent past, European and Japanese policy makers have done just enough to avoid a steep decline in economic activity \u2014 and they appear ready to continue, or even step up, their stimulus policies. The European Central Bank, for instance, has started two programs that are intended to increase bank lending.Even so, some investors fear that Europe and Japan may yet act too slowly \u2014 or may simply fail to do enough. \u201cI am making the heroic assumption that people there are smart enough and responsible enough to do the right thing,\u201d Philip J. Orlando, a senior portfolio manager at Federated, a mutual fund firm, said. \u201cBut clearly that is a heroic assumption.\u201dClifford Krauss and Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkish Leader, Using Conflicts, Cements Power ", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe reported price: nearly $350 million.Mr. Erdogan has been in power for more than a decade, an Islamist politician and prime minister who was often touted as a role model in the Muslim world for having reconciled his faith with democracy. But these days Mr. Erdogan stands for something quite different, having essentially pulled a Putin. Like Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, it does not matter which position he holds: He is his nation\u2019s paramount leader.In Turkey, the president is technically second to the prime minister. But in practice, when Mr. Erdogan was elected president in August, he absorbed the power and privilege of the prime minister\u2019s post into his new position. And like Mr. Putin, who also shifted between the presidency and prime minister\u2019s office, the stronger Mr. Erdogan has grown, the tenser relations have become with the United States.\u201cHe really has both offices, in a lot of ways,\u201d said Steven A. Cook, a Turkey expert and fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, referring to Mr. Erdogan.At the beginning of the year, none of this was assured. Still reeling from the sweeping antigovernment demonstrations of the summer of 2013, Mr. Erdogan was confronted with a wide-ranging corruption scandal that targeted him and his inner circle, prompting many analysts to predict the demise of his government.Instead, he has used his conflict with Washington and his political enemies as a force to help consolidate power, as he continues to carry out the duties associated with the prime minister. He has rallied his conservative base behind his religiously infused agenda, clashing with United States policy for confronting Islamic State militants, while also blaming foreign interference for the growing catalog of crises he faces. As Turkey\u2019s challenges have magnified \u2014 fighting on its border with Syria, strained relations with its NATO allies, pressure on the economy \u2014 Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authority has grown only stronger.Several features of the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was once seen as a role model for the Middle East, show him to have spent more than a decade silencing political dissent and amassing power.\u201cIt is our duty to explain to the world that there are modern Lawrences who were fooled by a terror organization,\u201d he said, without saying exactly whom he was talking about.Ahmet Davutoglu, the former foreign minister, is Turkey\u2019s prime minister. But Mr. Erdogan is the one on the phone with President Obama discussing Turkey\u2019s role in combating the Islamic State while the White House has to remind American diplomats to also include Mr. Davutoglu in discussions between the two countries.Turkey\u2019s continued refusal to allow the United States to use its bases for airstrikes against the Islamic State\u2019s forces in Syria and Iraq \u2014 and insistence that the coalition target the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria \u2014 has laid bare deep divisions between the two countries that have prompted analysts to question Turkey\u2019s reliability as an ally, and some have even suggested that Turkey be expelled from NATO.Early in his career, as mayor of Istanbul, Mr. Erdogan was jailed for reciting an Islamic poem in public. In his early years as prime minister, with the Turkish military still safeguarding the country\u2019s secular order, he kept in check his desire for a greater role for religion in public life, while pushing for membership in the European Union, a pursuit that is now stalled.In more recent years, with the military having been neutered through a series of sensational trials, he has become a more overtly Islamist leader. In the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings, Turkey sought to play a greater role in shaping regional affairs, supporting Islamist movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, which was voted into power in Egypt, and then ousted, dealing a painful blow to Turkey\u2019s ambitions.Mr. Erdogan has partly consolidated his power by purging thousands of police officers, prosecutors and judges who he believed were behind the corruption probe. He accused those people of being followers of the Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania and who once was an important ally to Mr. Erdogan. His victory over Mr. Gulen in the power struggle that ensued has largely erased a moderate, Western-leaning Islamic voice from the Turkish governing elite, even as many experts say that Mr. Gulen\u2019s followers had taken on an unhealthy influence in the police and judiciary.\u201cFor Tayyip Erdogan, like the Muslim Brotherhood and Muslim movements everywhere, the problems of the Muslim world are because of the West,\u201d said Rusen Cakir, a scholar of Islamist movements who lives in Istanbul.For Mr. Gulen, he said, \u201cthe problems for the Muslim world are because of Muslims themselves.\u201dThis trajectory away from the West has been crystallized in the continuing debate over Turkey\u2019s role in combating the Islamic State.Suat Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party who is now an outspoken critic, said the speech referring to Sykes-Picot demonstrated \u201chow much Erdogan detests Western powers operating in the region.\u201dOmer Taspinar, a scholar on Turkey at the Brookings Institution, said: \u201cThe Lawrence of Arabia speech was a part of this act \u2014 to show how the borders of the Middle East were drawn up by imperialists and how we are face to face with a new Western agenda.\u201dThis deep-seated view that the problems of the Middle East can be explained by Western actions over the past century, combined with a measure of ambivalence among Turkish religious conservatives who form the core of his constituency about joining the West in a fight against Sunnis, help explain Mr. Erdogan\u2019s reluctance to take a stronger role in the United States-led military coalition.The new palace, originally intended for the prime minister until Mr. Erdogan was elected president and decided he would move in, has become a potent symbol for his many critics. The construction, still continuing in a forest that is protected land, has occurred despite rulings by several courts that the development was illegal.Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a Turkish lawyer and journalist, said Mr. Erdogan simply ignored the courts.In characteristic fashion, Mr. Erdogan challenged the authorities early this year, saying, \u201cIf you have the power and courage, then come and demolish the building.\u201dThey did not, and Mr. Erdogan and his family will soon take up residence there.Ceylan Yeginsu contributed reporting from Istanbul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Lean Heavily on PACs in Coordinated Push to Counter G.O.P.", "Date": "2014-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With the battle for the Senate tilting toward Republicans and President Obama\u2019s approval ratings hovering near his all-time low, Democrats are more reliant than they have ever been on the very kind of big-money groups they have spent years trying to outlaw.They are countering the Republican Party\u2019s expansive and formidable outside spending network this fall with a smaller but more tightly knit alliance of groups that share donors, closely coordinate their advertising and hit harder than their conservative counterparts.To hold the Senate, the Democratic outside spending network is working hand in hand with \u2014 and is funded by \u2014 the party\u2019s traditional ideological allies, including abortion rights organizations, environmentalists and labor unions. They have overlapping board memberships, use the same voter data and even share advertising content. Most of their on-air money is being spent through a small cluster of \u201csuper PACs,\u201d which can explicitly advocate the election or defeat of specific candidates. And they have rapidly narrowed the traditional financial gap with Republican groups, alarming Republican strategists in what has otherwise been a dismal year for Democrats.Though their network is smaller, Democratic groups have been much better coordinated this election cycle than their Republican counterparts.\u201cThe Democrats \u2014 their coalition has been around a while, and it\u2019s tried and true, and they all know how to tango together. And the Republicans are all kind of doing their own individual dances,\u201d said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. Coordination on the right has been hampered by competition for donors and lingering distrust between the party-allied groups, like the Crossroads organizations, founded by Karl Rove, and those seeking to challenge the party establishment, such as Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners, the lead players in the political network overseen by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. The two sides have jockeyed for cash and influence, while also grappling with a wave of ideologically tinged primary battles this spring and summer that sucked up time, money and good will.To keep donors secret, most of the pro-Republican money is coursing not through super PACs but through political nonprofits. These groups do not have to disclose much about their finances, but are more restricted than super PACs in the types of advertising they can air. (In part to address the problem, the Koch network has pumped more cash into its sole super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund.) While Republicans have spent more over all on advertising during the midterm campaign, their cash has been spread among a larger array of groups. Many of them are newer organizations established or expanded by the Koch network this cycle. Others sprang up to cater to donors angry at the poor performance of Crossroads and other consultant-run groups in 2012.\u201cI think the problem for the Republicans is that all their big-money supporters are doing their own thing, and not really giving as much money to the party committees,\u201d Mr. Feehery said. \u201cThere\u2019s really very little coordination.\u201dSimilarly, in Colorado during the last 10 days of September, Democratic-sponsored ads attacked Representative Cory Gardner, the Republican nominee for the Senate, on just two fronts: his votes on Medicare and his positions on birth control. In a third set of ads, NextGen Climate Action has sought to link the birth control attacks to Mr. Gardner\u2019s environmental stance: \u201cHe\u2019d like to make your most private choices for you, and some of your not-so-private ones, too,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice intones, \u201clike the environment you live in.\u201dIn some races, different Democratic groups have simply run the same ad \u2014 a perfectly legal practice because outside groups can coordinate with one another, but one that is rare. In June, Emily\u2019s List, which supports Democratic female candidates who advocate abortion rights, announced a $3 million campaign to support Senator Kay Hagan, who is running for re-election in North Carolina. The campaign\u2019s second ad, an equal-pay-themed spot titled \u201cGroceries,\u201d was developed to appeal to female voters, and began running in August in Asheville, Charlotte and Greensboro. During the same period, the lead Democratic outside spender, Senate Majority PAC, spent $500,000 to run the same ad in the Raleigh market.\u201cThe advantage on the Democratic side is with a more top-down approach,\u201d said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco who specializes in political advertising. \u201cNot only does it mean you don\u2019t waste resources in terms of targeting, but your message can be consistent.\u201d Some Republicans argue that their messaging is more diverse because their opponents are playing defense on a wider range of issues. And to some extent, the fragmentation on the right is a natural condition for parties when they are out of power.\u201cIt\u2019s always going to be easier to coordinate when you\u2019ve got the White House, and you\u2019ve got this command and control structure where there\u2019s final authority,\u201d said Will Feltus, the senior vice president for research and planning at National Media Inc., a Republican media-buying company. The coordination of Democratic groups extends even to their office space. Susan McCue, a founder of Senate Majority PAC, shares a flat-screen-television-lined Washington office suite with American Bridge, the opposition-research hub that provides Democratic groups with the raw material of their campaign attacks. She also sits on the board of American Bridge. Senate Majority\u2019s campaigns director, Ty Matsdorf, hangs his hat at the Messina Group, the consulting firm founded by Jim Messina, the former campaign manager for President Obama. Mr. Messina also oversees Organizing for Action, Mr. Obama\u2019s issue advocacy organization, and Priorities USA Action, a super PAC that has turned its energies to support a Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential bid in 2016. In the meantime, Priorities has kicked in $500,000 to help Senate Majority PAC keep Democrats in the Senate \u2014 and agreed to hold off major fund-raising until the midterm election is over. More than half of all the outside advertising supporting Democratic Senate candidates this cycle has poured through Senate Majority PAC or a set of affiliated super PACs and nonprofit groups, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group at Kantar Media. Much of the rest has come from environmental organizations, like NextGen Climate Action, and women\u2019s rights groups that donate money to Senate Majority PAC, closely coordinate their advertising with it or do both.\u201cWhen Senate Majority PAC started in 2011, it just seemed like the best and most efficient way to run everything was through one organization,\u201d Mr. Matsdorf said. \u201cA lot of the success we\u2019re seeing this cycle, in fund-raising and from our political donors, is because they realize their money was effectively used by us.\u201d Officials from Democratic super PACs have attended meetings of the Democracy Alliance, a clearinghouse for liberal donors who fund an array of research, advocacy and political organizations. Contributions to the super PACs count toward the quota each alliance member must donate each year.By contrast, the twice-yearly donor conferences run by the Kochs\u2019 Freedom Partners network are typically limited to groups within the network, like Americans for Prosperity, Generation Opportunity and Concerned Veterans for America. Crossroads runs its own gatherings for donors \u2014 and competes aggressively with the Koch network for money.Virtually all of the liberal outside spending groups sit on weekly conference calls and \u201ctables\u201d that coordinate spending in each state. The system allows Democratic allies to not only coordinate advertising, but link it with intensive get-out-the-vote efforts organized by unions and other interest groups. (Dennis Rivera, a senior official of the Service Employees International Union, one of the country\u2019s most politically active unions, also sits on the board of Senate Majority.)The more collaborative Democratic approach, several party strategists said, has helped shrink the traditional advantage that conservative outside groups have enjoyed in advertising spending. Democratic and liberal outside groups have spent $77 million on political advertising during the 2014 cycle, according to one Democratic media buyer. Republican outside groups focused on the general election have spent about $113 million, a figure that includes some money spent by establishment organizations to beat back conservative primary challengers. In some weeks this fall, total advertising by Democratic candidates and groups has exceeded Republican advertising.Of course, the tightly run Democratic network hardly guarantees Democrats a victory in November. While the Republican outside network is more fragmented, it also had enough money to begin attacking Democrats as early as late last year, keeping Senate Democrats on the defensive, and forcing many Democratic candidates to dig into their own pockets earlier than expected. Mr. Feltus described the Republican approach as a free market of messaging and organization, in which the best and most effective groups would ultimately win. \u201cIn the marketplace of political ideas, the Republicans should have the advantage because we have more players who can try different things,\u201d Mr. Feltus said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Love Field Flight Limits End, and Passengers Cheer", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesThe official party at Love Field that consecrated a new era for commercial aviation in the metropolitan Dallas area had wound down the day before. For Barbara Cobb last Tuesday, the party was just getting started.Bound for Phoenix for a birthday celebration with friends, Ms. Cobb was struck by the happy realization that business travel was poised to become a comparative breeze for her.The owner of a company that makes high-end hats and bags, Ms. Cobb has been departing mostly from the less handy, more hectic Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on direct flights to the few dozen American cities where she displays her wares.Now, with the lifting of a longstanding law that limited the range of nonstops from Love, she will relish the short commute from home to board planes there that will save time and stress.\u201cThey are about to get all of my business, depending on where my destinations are,\u201d Ms. Cobb said of the area\u2019s smaller, compact airport. \u201cIt\u2019s such a positive thing.\u201dElation is centered among those regular fliers like Ms. Cobb who benefit from Love\u2019s proximity to downtown Dallas. Because some identical or similar routes are offered at both airports, travelers buffeted by airline consolidation and a reduction in flights have embraced a rare blessing: options.\u201cThis is good for passengers, at the end of the day,\u201d said Seth Miller, an aviation analyst and blogger in New York.Love Field, about six miles northwest of the city center, was christened in 1917. Dallas-Fort Worth, located midway between the cities, opened 57 years later, after which various airlines and municipalities signed what was known as the Wright Amendment, which restricted long-haul flights from Love. Until the pact expired through an act of Congress last week, eight long years after legislation prompting the change passed, planes leaving the elder airport had to touch down elsewhere in Texas or any of eight other nearby states.More important to fliers, it now schedules direct flights to seven farther-flung major cities that had been off limits. Eight will be added next month and two in January. The extra choices make Southwest more appealing to business travelers who disdain drawn-out itineraries with multiple stops.Two gates were taken by a newcomer to Love, Virgin America. By the end of the month, it will connect to four locations, twice the number it had at Dallas-Fort Worth, with 13 daily flights.The two airlines, an industry odd couple, toasted the upgrade in their own ways at separate events on Oct. 13. Southwest handed out special T-shirts and free round-trip tickets; Virgin distributed Champagne and chicken and waffles on a stick, and the country music luminary Kacey Musgraves performed two songs on the airline\u2019s first incoming flight to Love. That was all that time would allow on the plane, which took off from Dallas-Fort Worth barely 20 miles away.While Virgin\u2019s reputation is rooted in targeting business travelers, Southwest hardly ignores them. The airline estimates that 40 percent of its clientele travel for work purposes.\u201cYou go to Love at 7 a.m., you\u2019ll see more three-piece suits than backpacks,\u201d said Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant based in Evergreen, Colo.Visitors also will see an airport they would hardly recognize before a significant renovation was commissioned in anticipation of the amendment\u2019s demise.\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a vintage 1960s facility,\u201d said the industry consultant Robert Mann of Port Washington, N.Y., and a onetime employee of the dominant Dallas-Fort Worth airline, American.\u201cWhat Love Field has done is make things user-friendly,\u201d Ms. Cobb said, citing short lines at security and untaxing walks from parking spots to the terminal.But the perimeter rules imposed on planes out of Love became widely deemed unnecessary, if not unfair. The amendment\u2019s lapse leaves La Guardia and Ronald Reagan Washington National as the country\u2019s primary airports required to abide by distance limits on direct flights.Some analysts foresee another bonus: shrinking fares, driven by Southwest\u2019s label as a cost-friendly airline for fliers. Mr. Mann is skeptical, though, saying its fares have been inching up. He envisions existing economy pricing at Love rising to the level commonly found at Dallas-Fort Worth.Still, Southwest\u2019s consumer-conscious pricing and the heightened competition between the two airports figure to keep a lid on fares.Industry experts do not anticipate a seismic shift of fliers to Love, if for no other reason that it cannot grow beyond 20 gates, which is 145 fewer than at Dallas-Fort Worth.\u201cThere is not going to be an earth-shattering sea change,\u201d said Mr. Boyd, noting that passengers will refrain from abandoning frequent-flier accounts with American and other airlines at Dallas-Fort Worth. \u201cPeople are brand-loyal.\u201dYet Mr. Miller, who described Dallas-Fort Worth as a \u201cmassive sprawling city of an airport,\u201d said some fliers might opt for the reduced commotion of Love even if the commute from home or office is comparable in distance.For Ms. Cobb, it\u2019s no contest. So delighted is she that a reasonable increase in fares over time at Love would be no deterrent.\u201cI don\u2019t think people are going to mind when they do raise the cost because it\u2019s so convenient and such a nice airport,\u201d she said.As a result, Ms. Cobb might be fastening her seatbelt on more planes. With a sudden abundance of direct flights to potential markets, she is considering doubling her number of business trips next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Young College Graduates Are Choosing to Live", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUrban RenewalA participant in the Ninth Annual Denver Zombie Crawl along the 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver on Saturday. The city has become a powerful magnet for the young and educated.And as young people continue to spurn the suburbs for urban living, more of them are moving to the very heart of cities \u2014 even in economically troubled places like Buffalo and Cleveland. The number of college-educated people age 25 to 34 living within three miles of city centers has surged, up 37 percent since 2000, even as the total population of these neighborhoods has slightly shrunk.Some cities are attracting young talent while their overall population falls, like Pittsburgh and New Orleans. And in a reversal, others that used to be magnets, like Atlanta and Charlotte, are struggling to attract them at the same rate.\u201cIt\u2019s a type of growth that feeds on itself \u2014 the more young workers you have, the more companies are interested in locating their operations in that area and the more young people are going to move there,\u201d he said.Denver has become one of the most powerful magnets. Its population of the young and educated is up 47 percent since 2000, nearly double the percentage increase in the New York metro area. And 7.5 percent of Denver\u2019s population is in this group, more than the national average of 5.2 percent and more than anywhere but Washington, the Bay Area and Boston.Denver has many of the tangible things young people want, economists say, including mountains, sunshine and jobs in booming industries like tech. Perhaps more important, it also has the ones that give cities the perception of cultural cool, like microbreweries and bike-sharing and an acceptance of marijuana and same-sex marriage.\u201cWith lots of cultural things to do and getting away to the mountains, you can have the work-play balance more than any place I\u2019ve ever lived,\u201d said Colleen Douglass, 27, a video producer at Craftsy, a start-up with online classes for crafts. \u201cThere\u2019s this really thriving start-up scene here, and the sense we can be in a place we love and work at a cool new company but not live in Silicon Valley.\u201dAt the other end of the spectrum are the cities where less than 4 percent of the population are young college graduates. Among those, Detroit lost about 10 percent of this group, while Providence gained just 6 percent and Memphis 10 percent.The population of young, educated people in Dallas, Charlotte and Raleigh is also growing more slowly than their populations as a whole.The effects of the migration of the young and the restless are most vividly seen in urban cores. In 1980, young adults were 10 percent more likely than other people to live in these areas, according to the report from City Observatory, which is sponsored by the Knight Foundation. In 2010, they were 51 percent more likely, and those with college degrees were 126 percent more likely. The trend extends to all the largest metropolitan areas except Detroit and Birmingham, Ala.Of the metropolitan areas with the most populous city centers, Washington and Philadelphia showed the largest increases of young adults living there, at 75 and 78 percent. Other cities that have made big gains in that category are Baltimore, Los Angeles, San Diego, Dallas, Miami and St. Louis. Washington also had the largest share of young college graduates over all, at 8.1 percent.\u201cThey want something exciting, culturally fun, involving a lot of diversity \u2014 and their fathers\u2019 suburban lifestyle doesn\u2019t seem to be all that thrilling to many of them,\u201d Mr. Glaeser said.How many eventually desert the city centers as they age remains to be seen, but demographers predict that many will stay. They say that could not only bolster city economies, but also lead to decreases in crime and improvements in public schools. If the trends continue, places like Pittsburgh and Buffalo could develop a new reputation \u2014 as role models for resurgence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $90 Million Condo Flip Shows What\u2019s Wrong With Financial Capitalism", "Date": "2014-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Big DealBill Ackman is a condo flipper! It may be the most expensive attempted condo flip in history, but in substance it isn\u2019t much different from the middle-class dreamers who bought a preconstruction condo in Florida in the mid-2000s in hopes of selling it a couple of years later at a great profit.It may seem like a funny example of the ways the wealthiest one-hundredth of 1 percent live. But it is also, as it happens, an uncommonly clear window into some of the deeper flaws of 21st-century finance.Why do we have a financial industry? Banks, bond and stock markets, hedge funds and private equity shops play a lot of roles in the economy, but the most fundamental is to channel capital to its highest and most productive use. That\u2019s a really important role, on which economic growth depends. When it is done wrong (as when the financial system funneled billions to money-burning dot-coms in the late 1990s or toward unsupportable mortgage loans in the mid-2000s), the consequences are devastating. When the financial system channels money to companies with good business prospects, making capital available to those with the best ideas, it works for everybody.There are arms of the financial industry that don\u2019t immediately seem to fit that classification of \u201cpeople who help steer capital to productive uses\u201d but that do make the whole system work better. For example, in futures markets there are traders whom you might want to write off as speculators, but in fact provide a useful service. They ensure that when an airline needs to insure against rising jet fuel prices, or a manufacturer wants to avoid the risk of being paid in a falling currency, somebody will be willing to take the other side of that trade at a reasonable price.But at some point you get to parts of the financial industry that aren\u2019t making the economy more efficient. There you find the people exploiting momentary inefficiencies to get richer without making the rest of us any better off. High-frequency trading algorithms are a prime example, with enormous computing power deployed toward exploiting split-second moves that have no meaningful benefit for a company that uses the stock market to raise capital or a long-term investor who wants to buy that stock.There is a lot of financial activity in which it can be hard to tell whether it\u2019s the good type of financial speculation or the bad. When a private equity outfit takes over a company, is it replacing poor management with better management, or just cutting research and development expense and taking on more debt in hopes of flipping the company without actually doing anything to improve its long-term prospects?In those cases, the answer is ambiguous and debatable.Which brings us back to Mr. Ackman\u2019s apparent plans for the penthouse at One57. What makes it interesting is that unlike a typical private equity deal or hedge fund, it is pretty transparent what is going on here, if one takes his comments to The Times at face value.Even if he\u2019s right \u2014 and the combination of other super-luxe condo towers now under construction, increasingly hostile relations between the United States and billionaire-rich Russia, and falling oil prices that will hurt the income of Middle Eastern plutocrats all work against him \u2014 it\u2019s a fascinating study in financial speculation that isn\u2019t creating any value for society.The finance guys who provided the construction loan that funded the building of One57 helped create value. So did the architects who designed it, the construction workers who built it and the developers who brought all these pieces together to turn a raw piece of land into a 90-story tower with a hotel and housing that people can make good use of.Mr. Ackman is making a bet that the high-end real estate market in New York, for whatever reason, currently misprices the penthouse, and that in a few years this mispricing will be corrected. In the meantime, a 13,500-square-foot apartment with magnificent views of Central Park and, on a clear day, the entirety of New York, will sit empty the great majority of the time waiting for that day.It\u2019s actually destroying value: There\u2019s the opportunity cost of whatever the apartment would rent for, plus the maintenance fees and property tax his investment group will have to pay on the empty condo used for the occasional party.Mr. Ackman\u2019s deluxe apartment in the sky may not be his biggest deal this year, or the one most important to his long-term wealth and reputation. But it is the clearest example you can find of a financier doing a deal that does nothing to make the economy better off.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Clear Majority Party Emerges in Bulgaria Vote", "Date": "2014-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 Bulgaria faced the prospect of another shaky governing coalition on Sunday as exit polls indicated that as many as eight political parties could have a voice in a new Parliament.The Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria, a center-right party known by its Bulgarian acronym GERB, won about a third of the vote on Sunday but fell short of an outright majority, according to exit polls. The Socialist Party, the leaders of the previous cabinet, captured only about 16 percent of the vote. The Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which represents the country\u2019s Turkish minority, gathered a little more than 15 percent, according to early exit poll results.Three smaller parties also won seats, while two others hovered around the 4 percent threshold to enter Parliament, which has 240 seats.By 10:30 p.m. on Sunday, 80 percent of the votes had been counted. About half of eligible Bulgarians voted. Official results are expected on Monday.Boiko Borisov, GERB\u2019s leader, thanked supporters at a news conference here in the capital, but declined to mention potential coalition partners. \u201cWith this configuration, I don\u2019t see how we\u2019re going to form a cabinet,\u201d he said.The Reformist Bloc, an alliance of five center-right parties that many saw as GERB\u2019s best partner to form a stable coalition, captured just 9 percent of the vote, which dashed most hopes for a two-party partnership. But Radan Kanev, leader of the Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria, part of the Reformist Bloc, said Sunday that it was still a possibility because the final results had not yet been tallied.Other alternatives for GERB included a grand coalition with the Socialists or a more complex multiparty alliance with a host of less likely partners.The election, Bulgaria\u2019s third in just two years, was called after the previous minority government, led by the Socialists, resigned in July. The cabinet was forced to step down after the party lost the support of its coalition partners following a poor performance in European Parliament elections in May.Last year\u2019s mass protests erupted just three weeks into the cabinet\u2019s term, when the Socialists appointed the media tycoon Delyan Peevski as director of the national security agency without any hearings or debates. The appointment was later revoked but demonstrators continued to demand the cabinet\u2019s resignation.Bulgaria, the European Union\u2019s poorest member, has been politically unstable since early 2013, when nationwide protests over high energy bills forced the cabinet, led by GERB, to resign. In the snap election that followed, Mr. Borisov\u2019s party failed to win a majority and was unable to attract a coalition partner, and was forced into the role of opposition.A Gallup poll conducted last month found that about a third of voters supported GERB but 59 percent thought Mr. Borisov should not be prime minister. The poll, which was based on in-person interviews of 1,010 eligible Bulgarian voters, was conducted Sept. 12-18 and had a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.Bulgaria, which joined the European Union in 2007, is struggling to catch up economically to the rest of Europe. The economy is growing at a rate of 1.6 percent annually but its per capita gross domestic product is only about 50 percent of the bloc\u2019s average.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazilians Are Shocked, Shocked at Corruption!", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWe Brazilians suffer from a curious cognitive dysfunction, which occurs with the same frequency in our population as lactose intolerance does among the Japanese, or the inclination for punning among the English. We have the ability to be outraged by corruption, while engaging in our own petty versions of it. As the second round of presidential voting approaches on Sunday, this evil is spreading like an epidemic. In bars, on the streets and on social networks, advocates of Dilma Rousseff, the Workers Party candidate for re-election, and Senator A\u00e9cio Neves, of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, never tire of reminding us of the \u201crobberies\u201d that their rivals commit.Workers Party supporters cite the re-election scandal in which Social Democrats were accused of bribing congressmen to approve a constitutional amendment allowing Fernando Henrique Cardoso to compete again for the presidency in 1998. Social Democrats\u2019 supporters mention the \u201cMensal\u00e3o,\u201d a case in which congressmen allied with the Workers Party regularly received money diverted from Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s illegal campaign contributions. Those not involved in the party squabbles tend to blame all the politicians, as if the politicians were a separate species, able to corrupt our reputable citizens. Our citizens don\u2019t really need the help. My introduction to Brazilians\u2019 cavalier attitude toward corruption came through family. When I was about 7 years old, we went to a Sunday lunch at my uncle Arthur\u2019s. Arthur (not his real name) was my richest uncle, and he lived in a house with a pool. During lunch, he proudly told our family he had found a way to turn off the water register in front of the house and could now fill his pool for free. I do not remember any member of my family reprimanding him. Today, my uncle is retired, and he sends me angry emails about the corruption in the Workers Party government.I would like to believe that the country\u2019s advancements in recent decades have made us more ethical, but that is not the case. A friend of mine, a lawyer in her 30s, has a hairdresser\u2019s license so she can get discounts on shampoo. She is a partner in a tax law firm and earns enough in a year to pay for shampoo for three future generations of her family. A psychoanalyst whom I consulted years ago proposed to charge me less if I paid for my sessions in cash, thus allowing him to bypass the tax authorities. In Rio de Janeiro, when you ask a taxi driver for a receipt, the usual response is, \u201cWhat value do you want me to put in?\u201d The reason being, the driver can give you a receipt with an inflated charge that allows you to steal 10 or 20 reais from your employer. Of course, in return for this \u201cfavor,\u201d he expects a small percentage in cash. Even when we go to the movies, Brazilians find a way to bend the rules \u2014 if there is a line we will look for a friend who is in a better position and think nothing of jumping ahead. But on Facebook and Twitter, the two parties, or politicians in general, clearly are to blame for all our adversities.Sure there have been advances in the 20 years that the parties have been in power. Under Mr. Cardoso (1995-2003), hyperinflation ended, the Brazilian real was strengthened, and the economy improved. Mr. da Silva (2003-2011) and Ms. Rousseff (2011 to date) deepened and extended social programs that have lifted more than 40 million people out of poverty. These advances, however, were made without putting an end to old problems: spurious alliances to obtain the majority in Congress, the exchange of favors, cronyism and corruption. These are traces of a country that emerged 514 years ago as Portugal\u2019s overseas pantry, where men were making money far from the law, the church and their wives \u2014 first, by exploiting pau brasil (a red tree whose sap was used to dye fabrics and that lent its name to our country), and after that by planting sugar cane, trafficking in slaves, and mining for gold and gems. Much of the disregard for consequences and of the expediency practiced by these explorers still exists today. Am I the only Brazilian free of these traits? Of course not! Last year, I bought a refrigerator. The store said that, in addition to the delivery, they could install it for 450 reais. I thought that was expensive, and said I would do it myself. When the fridge arrived, however, I realized I couldn\u2019t handle it. The delivery man coughed and proposed: \u201cIf you want it, I can install it now, for 100 reais, but the people from the store cannot find out.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d I nodded. Uncle Arthur would have been proud of me.The other day, looking at that fridge, I realized that it is an image of today\u2019s Brazil: powerful, showy, forward-looking, but working on the old connections we insist on perpetuating. President Rousseff or Senator Neves will win the election, but it will take longer to solve the problems that hold back Brazil from being a great country. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Conflict Between Germany and the E.C.B. That Threatens Europe", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContinent's DriftIt\u2019s not an overstatement to say that the future of Europe depends on how this conflict is resolved.In Germany, by contrast, both elected leaders in Berlin and central bankers at the Bundesbank in Frankfurt view the worry over deflation as overwrought, the need for fiscal probity as critical, and any effort to print money to buy government bonds as the pathway to hyperinflationary perdition.It\u2019s worth adding that most everybody on this side of the Atlantic, the International Monetary Fund and the United States government, for example, is on Team Draghi in this dispute. Indeed, the widespread view among economists in the United States and Britain is that the risks facing Europe are grave and that the need for easing both monetary and fiscal policy is urgent.So why will this dispute determine the future of Europe? Because Mr. Draghi is steering through Scylla and Charybdis, with radically different outcomes for Europe on either side.If Mr. Draghi and the E.C.B. take insufficient action and the eurozone economy indeed stagnates or falls into a long recession, it could mean a lost generation of Europeans living with high unemployment and declining living standards. We can\u2019t know for sure whether Europeans would react to this outcome by being content to muddle through, or if they would elect radical politicians who might endanger the era of a Europe united around liberal democratic ideals. So far Europeans have been O.K. with muddling along amid high unemployment, but it\u2019s a really bad result either way.There are two ways this could go for a happier outcome.Maybe the European economy will heal itself. Maybe growth will return and inflation will get back to the 2 percent the E.C.B. aims for without much further action out of the central bank. If this happens, the strategy of austere fiscal policy and cautious monetary policy will be vindicated. Then again, we\u2019ve been waiting for that self-generated recovery to come along for four years or so now, and they say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing but expecting different results.And the final possibility is that Mr. Draghi will display sufficient political savvy to encourage policies that jolt the eurozone economy into a better place while tamping down the blowback. Germans may squawk, but if Mr. Draghi can show both the independence and resolve to take an unpopular action, and the subtle touch to avoid any concrete consequences (like adverse legal rulings or Germany threatening to leave the euro), then his independence will be rewarded.What the latest reporting shows, though, is just how deep the anger over E.C.B. policies runs in Germany and how tricky this task will be for Mr. Draghi.Advertisement"}

So far, 23 states have declined to do so.At its most basic level, the Affordable Care Act was intended to reduce the number of Americans without health insurance. Measured against that goal, it has made considerable progress.A perfect measurement of the numbers of people affected by the law is still difficult, but a series of private sector surveys and a government report reach the same basic estimates: The number of Americans without health insurance has been reduced by about 25 percent this year \u2014 or eight million to 11 million people.Of that total, it appears that more than half of people who are newly insured signed up for Medicaid, especially in the states that opted to broaden eligibility for the program to low-income residents. Most of the rest enrolled in private health plans through the new state insurance marketplaces.\u201cThere\u2019s no question it\u2019s come down,\u201d Dan Witters said of the uninsured rate.

But consumers will need to shop around to keep their costs down.Insurers are expected to continue trying to control costs by restricting consumers from using doctors out of their network.By ABBY GOODNOUGH, REED ABELSON and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLISOf the 7.3 million people who signed up for private insurance through online exchanges during the first enrollment period, 85 percent qualified for federal subsidies that decreased the cost of their premiums.Though many people have found policies with affordable premiums, high deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs have discouraged some people from using their insurance.Early rate filings by insurers in 21 states suggest that rates will vary widely, but the median premium increases for 2015 for silver plans will be around 4 percent and there will be more insurers in the market. But consumers will need to shop around to keep their costs down.Insurers are expected to continue trying to control costs by restricting consumers from using doctors out of their network.The goal is right there in the name: the Affordable Care Act. When President Obama signed the measure in 2010, he pledged that it would protect Americans from ruinously high medical bills by guaranteeing them access to comprehensive \u2014 and affordable \u2014 coverage. For millions of people who gained insurance through the law, this has proved true.About 7.3 million people, including many who might otherwise be shut out of the market because of costly medical conditions, remain enrolled in private coverage through the law\u2019s online marketplaces. Eighty-five percent of those who signed up during the enrollment period qualified for federal subsidies to help pay premiums. For those who qualified for subsidies through the federal exchange, the subsidies lowered the cost by 76 percent on average, according to the Obama administration.But the law \u2014 by requiring insurers to provide a broader array of benefits and to cover people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 caused premiums to rise for some who already had insurance. Many of those people were young and in good health, had plans that offered sharply limited benefits that were canceled because of the law, or were not eligible for subsidies.For now, dire warnings that the law would cause premiums for most people to rise sharply have proved unfounded. The law has spurred competition, with new companies entering the market. And early indications are that premium increases next year will be relatively modest. One analysis of early regulatory filings by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform found that insurers are proposing a median increase of 4 percent in 21 states for silver plans, although people should consider switching plans to find the lowest price.Another McKinsey analysis found that in 43 states that have released information, there has been a 22 percent increase in the number of insurers for 2015. Many of the new insurers are in markets where competition was already flourishing. But it also appears there will be fewer places with little or no competition: In 21 states, McKinsey found, the number of markets with just one or two carriers fell to 10, from 41.How premiums will change in 21 statesHow premiums will change in 21 statesNote: Premium changes are shown for a 40-year-old, before tax subsidies.Source: McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System ReformBut for some consumers who bought plans with affordable premiums, high deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs have discouraged them from seeking care. Another major question is whether insurers, in trying to keep costs down, have been too restrictive about allowing consumers to use doctors outside their company\u2019s network.In New York, New Jersey and Georgia, the vast majority of exchange plans allow only in-network care. Nationally, roughly half of the plans offered through Healthcare.gov, the federal exchange, are either health maintenance organizations or exclusive provider organizations, which do not allow their customers to go out of network, except in emergencies or through an often arduous appeals process.The limited selection has helped keep premiums down, but also made \u201csurprise balance billing\u201d \u2014 or high bills that are not covered \u2014 more likely, experts say. New York recently passed a law to prevent such billings.There are also wide variations in prices within states, as insurers pursue different strategies and struggle to determine how much they need to charge to cover their costs. Someone in Dalton, Ga., for example, will see the cost of a midlevel silver plan from WellPoint\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield decline by 12 percent, according to 2015 rate filings. But in Dublin, Ga., three and a half hours away, a person who bought a silver plan from Humana could see the price rise by nearly a third.With such variability, it is hard to know who will find the plans unaffordable this time around. For now, the evidence suggests that middle-income people who don\u2019t qualify for subsidies, or who qualify only for small ones, are most likely to struggle with the cost. In a Commonwealth Fund survey conducted this spring, 44 percent of adults with incomes above 250 percent of the poverty level, or $29,175 for individuals, found it difficult to pay their premiums for marketplace plans, compared with 33 percent of those with incomes below that level.For that reason, experts say it is critical that consumers shop around when enrollment begins on Nov. 15, since their current insurer may be raising rates even as other companies lower theirs.In places where the law is already achieving its goal of fostering additional competition \u2014 Maine, for instance \u2014 consumers appear to be less likely to feel \u201crate shock,\u201d where premiums go up by double digits. But in states where there is less competition, residents appear more likely to have to pay higher prices next year, unless they qualify for a higher subsidy. And those larger rate increases are fodder for political attacks against the law, particularly in states with closely contested Senate races this fall, like Louisiana or Iowa.In one state with minimal competition, Vermont, the biggest insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, will be increasing the price of its lowest-cost silver plan by about 9 percent.For Jessica Porter, a psychiatric nurse practitioner from South Burlington, that is a problem. Her family of six is paying $1,637 a month for a platinum plan, which comes with relatively generous coverage but high premiums. But their income is too high to qualify for a subsidy, she said, so she and her husband have put off saving for retirement to pay their premiums.\u201cBlue Cross is basically the only player in town,\u201d she said.Most experts say there is not enough data yet on the entire population to determine whether the law is improving the nation\u2019s health.The best early data is on young people, and it suggests that the law is benefiting that group by allowing them to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance. The share of 19- to 25-year-olds without health insurance declined to 21 percent in the first quarter of this year, from 34 percent in 2010, a reduction of about four million people.Young college graduates were far more likely to report excellent health, to have a primary care doctor and to go to the doctor regularly than before the law.Indicators for how well the law is working for older people are few, but one \u2013 screenings for colon cancer \u2013 shows marked growth, as screening rates for people with private insurance rose to 56 percent in 2012, from 48 percent in 2010.By SABRINA TAVERNISEMost experts say there is not enough data yet on the entire population to determine whether the law is improving the nation\u2019s health.The best early data is on young people, and it suggests that the law is benefiting that group by allowing them to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance.

It was one of the first changes to happen under the 2010 law, giving researchers more data and turning the young into a kind of natural experiment.Most striking, however, was the effect on young college graduates. They were far more likely to report excellent health (an important indicator of future sickness and mortality, experts say), to have a primary care doctor, and to go to the doctor regularly than before the law.Outside the young adult age group, changes were more muted. An early look in September at the first quarter of 2014 found very little change in a dozen or so measures for the population at large, including the number of flu shots received, whether people had a regular place to go for medical care, and whether people had to forgo medical care because of cost.A few benefits, however, came early under the law, and some seemed to make a difference. Starting in 2010, the law required that insurance plans cover preventive screenings without charge to patients. One screening that has jumped is the colonoscopy. Screening rates for people with private insurance went from 48 percent in 2010 to 56 percent in 2012, according to the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a health research nonprofit organization that collects data from the majority of health plans in the country.Federal and state officials say that the online health care marketplaces that performed so badly last fall have been upgraded to ensure smoother service when they reopen Nov. 15.But both new and old customers are expected to flood onto the exchanges, testing their capacities, and the \u201cback end\u201d of the federal system, where insurers receive applications and bill the government for subsidy payments, is not completed.Though many of the 14 state-run exchanges are fine, several remain question marks, including those in Maryland, Massachusetts, Hawaii and Vermont.By ABBY GOODNOUGHFederal and state officials say that the online health care marketplaces that performed so badly last fall have been upgraded to ensure smoother service when they reopen Nov. 15.But both new and old customers are expected to flood onto the exchanges, testing their capacities, and the \u201cback end\u201d of the federal system, where insurers receive applications and bill the government for subsidy payments, is not completed.Though many of the 14 state-run exchanges are fine, several remain question marks, including those in Maryland, Massachusetts, Hawaii and Vermont.President Obama promised that buying health insurance on the online health care exchanges would be as easy as buying plane tickets on Kayak. Instead, most Americans were essentially locked out of HealthCare.gov, the federal online insurance marketplace that served 36 states, for two crucial months last fall. Many of the 14 state-run marketplaces also malfunctioned, and millions of tax dollars have been spent fixing all the defects.Now a question looms over the second enrollment period, which starts Nov. 15: Will the system work better this time around? Federal and state officials, and a number of outside experts, say they think it will.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get those blue screens of death anymore,\u201d said Dan Schuyler, senior director for exchange technology at Leavitt Partners, a consulting firm.But several significant new challenges will test the exchanges this time. Even as millions of new customers are expected to use the exchanges this fall, many of the 7.3 million who bought private marketplace plans last year will return to update information or seek better deals from different companies. Moreover, the \u201cback end\u201d of the federal exchange, which the government uses to enroll consumers in health plans and to send subsidy payments to insurers, remains unfinished.Nevada and Oregon have also given up on their botched state-run websites, which are now targets of lawsuits and investigations, and will use the federal marketplace instead. And Maryland and Massachusetts are scrambling to rebuild their sites with new software before open enrollment.The Congressional Budget Office predicts that total enrollment will grow to 13 million in 2015. Those already enrolled will need to renew their coverage by Dec. 15, and while they can do so automatically by taking no action, many may return to HealthCare.gov to shop around.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of demand to handle,\u201d Mr. Schuyler said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how well you plan and how many servers you have at the ready to take on this type of volume; at some point, things are going to slow down.\u201dThe federal exchange is trying to make things easier with a shorter and simpler application. The exchange also started testing earlier than last year.\u201cI\u2019m a realist, and we will not get it perfect,\u201d said Andrew Slavitt, principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, at a congressional hearing in September. \u201cBut we have, I think, the right processes in place to make it as good as it should be.\u201dAlthough most state-based exchanges are operating quite well at this point, a few are struggling. In Maryland, where at least $40 million has been spent rebuilding the exchange using technology from Connecticut\u2019s more successful version, tens of thousands of people who signed up for private coverage during the first enrollment period will have to re-enroll by mid-December if they want to keep their subsidy. The state will introduce its revamped website in phases, not opening it for general use until the fifth day of open enrollment.In Massachusetts, where the state and federal government are spending at least $80 million to fix its website with new software, officials promise it will work this fall.The future of troubled exchanges in Hawaii and Vermont is also in question. Vermont took its exchange offline last month to complete a number of repairs, although state officials say it will be working by Nov. 15. The Hawaii exchange, which just hired its third director, still has operational problems and is struggling more than most to stay afloat financially.Mr. Schuyler said the Obama administration \u201cis not going to give a state-based marketplace a green light unless they are completely confident it can make it.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t want a similar situation to last year,\u201d he added.Wall Street analysts and health care experts say the law helped the industry financially by providing new customers to insurers and new paying patients to hospitals.The most direct beneficiary of the law is the insurance industry, which is now experiencing growth in the demand for private insurance.The number of insurers participating in the online health exchanges is projected to grow in 2015, an indication of the anticipated profitability of the marketplace.By REED ABELSONWall Street analysts and health care experts say the law helped the industry financially by providing new customers to insurers and new paying patients to hospitals.The most direct beneficiary of the law is the insurance industry, which is now experiencing growth in the demand for private insurance.The number of insurers participating in the online health exchanges is projected to grow in 2015, an indication of the anticipated profitability of the marketplace.From the beginning, opponents of the Affordable Care Act have warned that it represented a \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d of the health care system that would lead to crippling regulations on both for-profit companies and nonprofit players. But to the contrary, Wall Street analysts and health care experts say, the industry appears to be largely flourishing, in part because of the additional business the law created.Health care accounts for roughly $3 trillion in spending in the United States so it is difficult to tease out the law\u2019s impact. The online exchanges have also been open for only a year. But analysts and policy experts who watch the industry closely agree that in the first year, the nation\u2019s health care system mostly benefited from the law, which brought new customers to insurers, new paying patients to hospitals and new prescription users to the pharmaceutical industry.\u201cThe irony is if you look sector by sector, the A.C.A. has resulted in pretty substantial earnings across the board,\u201d said Paul H. Keckley, managing director of the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis, a consulting firm unit.By one measure, the stock market, for-profit health insurers, hospitals and drug companies did well. One index that includes those companies, the S\u2009&\u2009P 500 Health Care Index, rose by 24 percent over the last year, outperforming the overall stock market.The health insurers are the most direct beneficiaries of the law. In recent years, the private insurance market for adults under 65 has steadily declined as more companies stopped offering insurance to employees and more individuals became unable to afford coverage, a trend expected to continue. But the Affordable Care Act has provided subsidies that have helped millions afford coverage. For the insurers, the health care exchanges are now \u201creally the only game in town in terms of growth\u201d for private insurance, said John F. Holahan, a policy expert from the Urban Institute.Most health care companieshave been posting healthy profits.QUARTERLY EARNINGS PER SHAREHospital companiesCommunityHealth Sys.Health Mgmt.AssociatesHCA+$10\u201912\u201914\u20131Health insurance companiesUnited HealthAetnaHumana+$3+2+10\u201912\u201914\u20131Pharmaceutical companiesNovartisPfizerAstraZeneca+$2+10\u201912\u201914\u20131+120%The S.& P. 500 health care indexhas beaten the S.& P. 500-stockindex since last year \u2026()()+90+60+30\u2026 and most health care companies have posted healthy profits so far this year.0\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914Hospital companiesQUARTERLY EARNINGS PER SHARECommunityHealth SystemsHealth Mgmt.AssociatesLifePointHospitalsTenetHealthcareUniversalHealth ServicesHCA+$10\u201912\u201914\u20131Health insurance companiesCignaUnited HealthAetnaHumanaWellpointMetLife+$3+2+10\u201912\u201914\u20131Pharmaceutical companiesJohnson& JohnsonNovartisPfizerAstraZenecaTevaEli Lilly+$2+10\u201912\u201914\u20131Source: BloombergOne clear sign that the carriers find the market attractive is the decision by more of them to offer policies through the online health exchanges. UnitedHealth Group, a for-profit company that operates one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, originally chose to offer individual plans through the exchanges in only a handful of states. But in 2015, the company says, it plans to offer plans in as many as two dozen. There are 56 new insurers entering the market so far this year, according to a count by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform.But contrary to what some liberals predicted, the law has not been a boon in every way for the insurance industry. State and federal officials are much more closely dictating what the insurers can do, and the marketplace had also encouraged more competition for the plans. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a more pressured environment,\u201d said Vishnu Lekraj, a senior health care analyst who follows the area for Morningstar Inc.The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that hospitals will save $5.7 billion in so-called uncompensated care costs this year because more people have insurance. And nearly three-quarters of those savings, $4.2 billion, has gone to the 25 states and the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid at the beginning of 2014.Whether such benefits continue remains unclear. But for now, the law is providing a \u201ctail wind\u201d to hospitals, said Michael D. Gregory, a portfolio manager for Highland Capital who invests in health care.The Affordable Care Act allows states to expand Medicaid to people not previously eligible, including some people above the poverty level \u2013 but the United States Supreme Court in 2012 ruled that expansion was optional for states.As a result, only 27 states and the District of Columbia have expanded, while Republican opposition in other states has blocked expansion.In states without expanded Medicaid, a coverage gap exists for people who earn too much to receive Medicaid, but too little to receive federal subsidies to reduce insurance premiums. About half of the people who fall in that gap nationally live in Texas, Florida or Georgia.Under pressure from hospitals that stand to gain federal funds from Medicaid expansion, Republican governors in several states are now moving toward expansion, some through so-called private option plans.By ROBERT PEARThe Affordable Care Act allows states to expand Medicaid to people not previously eligible, including some people above the poverty level \u2013 but the United States Supreme Court in 2012 ruled that expansion was optional for states.As a result, only 27 states and the District of Columbia have expanded, while Republican opposition in other states has blocked expansion.In states without expanded Medicaid, a coverage gap exists for people who earn too much to receive Medicaid, but too little to receive federal subsidies to reduce insurance premiums.

And in states that have expanded eligibility \u2014 to include people with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level (up to $16,105 for an individual) \u2014 Medicaid appears to be achieving that goal.Since last October, federal officials say, 8.7 million people have been added to the Medicaid rolls, 7.5 million of them in the 27 states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility. That is comparable to the 7.3 million people who obtained private insurance through the exchanges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\u201cStates that expanded Medicaid have seen a remarkable reduction in the number of uninsured, a drop of nearly 40 percent,\u201d said Stan Dorn, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group. \u201cThat compares with a reduction of less than 10 percent in states that have not expanded.\u201dNot all states have expanded Medicaid, because the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the expansion was optional. So governments in 23 states, most of them Republican-controlled, have blocked expansion, asserting that the cost could eventually become a state responsibility.How Medicaid enrollment has changed in each state       States that expanded their programs under the law are shown in greenN.M.35% ofpopulationenrolledVt.N.Y.30%Calif.W.Va.Ark.Del.Ore.,R.I25%Ky.Ohio, Ill.Miss.La.Wash.HawaiiAriz.,Mass.,Mich.\u00a0Okla.Tenn.Colo.Wis.20%Minn.Pa.*, N.C.Nev.Md.S.C., IowaInd., Ala.N.J.Ga., Idaho,Fla.Tex.,AlaskaMont.15%Kan., S.D.Mo.Neb.Wyo., UtahN.D.BEFOREAFTERVa., N.H.*10%5%+5 or more+2.5 to 5+1 to 2.5\u20131 to +1PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE0%Change in Medicaid coverage by stateExpanded Medicaid% Enrolled, 2013201410%1520253035Vt.Ky.Ore.W.Va.Ark.N.M.Nev.R.I.Colo.Wash.Calif.Md.Ariz.N.J.Minn.OhioIll.Mass.N.Y.Mich.IowaN.H.*N.D.Del.HawaiiPa.*Did not expandMont.Ga.Tenn.Miss.S.C.IdahoAla.Fla.Ind.AlaskaN.C.Tex.La.Okla.UtahWis.Kan.S.D.Wyo.Neb.Mo.Va.Note: Includes Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. \u201cBefore\u201d figures represent the average enrollment for the months of July 2013 through Sept. 2013 and are not available for Maine and Connecticut. \u201cAfter\u201d figures are from August 2014, the latest month available. Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ServicesThe government does not know for sure how many of the people gaining coverage under the Affordable Care Act were previously insured or uninsured.Moreover, sizable numbers of residents in those states, including childless adults and the working poor, fall into a coverage gap: They make too much for traditional Medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidies in the insurance exchanges.Researchers at the Urban Institute estimate that 6.3 million uninsured adults fall into that coverage gap, with about half living in three states: Texas (1.5 million), Florida (1 million) and Georgia (570,000). The group includes 1.6 million blacks, 1.3 million Latinos and 1.5 million people under the age of 25.Opposition to the expansion of Medicaid appears to be softening in some states, partly because of pressure from hospitals. Nine states with Republican governors, including Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, are expanding Medicaid. Republican governors in Indiana and Utah are negotiating with the Obama administration on possible expansion. And in Tennessee, the Republican governor is trying to find a way to expand Medicaid despite skepticism among Republican lawmakers.With so many new people in the expanded program, another question has emerged: Are there enough doctors to serve them? Many urban and rural areas were already struggling with shortages of doctors willing to take Medicaid patients before the law took effect, experts say.\u201cBeneficiaries have reported serious problems obtaining the care they need, particularly specialty care,\u201d said Sarah Somers, who represents poor people as a lawyer at the National Health Law Program.Health care spending had begun slowing even before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.The reasons included recession, higher-deductible policies that discourage people from seeking health care services, and a decline in the development of new, costly prescription drugs.But reductions in wasteful or unneeded care may also be factors in the slowdown, and experts say the Affordable Care Act may help reinforce those changes.In the short term, the law could actually drive up health care spending by bringing more insured people into the system.By MARGOT SANGER-KATZHealth care spending had begun slowing even before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.The reasons included recession, higher-deductible policies that discourage people from seeking health care services, and a decline in the development of new, costly prescription drugs.But reductions in wasteful or unneeded care may also be factors in the slowdown, and experts say the Affordable Care Act may help reinforce those changes.In the short term, the law could actually drive up health care spending by bringing more insured people into the system.National health care$9,582$10,000$6,0002010Law passes$2,000\u201960\u201980\u201900\u201914*from the previous year.+8%+6%+4%+3.1%+2%\u201961\u201980\u201900\u201914**Projection.

The authors of the Affordable Care Act believed that the key to wringing dollars out of the health care system was reducing unnecessary and wasteful care that cost money without helping patients. If the health care system is starting to do that, and new policy helps reward the welcome change, then there is a chance that the trend could hold.For that reason, Peter R. Orszag, the former Obama administration budget director and now a vice chairman at Citigroup, thinks that the Affordable Care Act should get only partial credit for the slowdown. \u201cI view it as kind of an accelerant and reinforcement,\u201d he said of the law.But the real long-term test of the health law will be whether, once those new people are absorbed into the system, the current downward trend in spending growth can be sustained.\u201cThe experiment is on, and everyone knows they\u2019re a lab rat,\u201d said Douglas J.

{"Headline": "\u2018Moment of Truth\u2019 on Emissions", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFall is now here. More to the point, the word is that the E.P.A. and the White House are in the process of deciding what tack to take in reducing methane emissions (though any announcement will probably have to wait until after the November elections). If the administration takes the right course, methane emissions could likely be reduced by 40 percent or 50 percent over the next five years \u2014 enough to make natural gas a genuinely cleaner alternative to coal and a critical component in reducing greenhouse gasses. But if it doesn\u2019t \u2014 if the government decides to back away from regulation, or allow industry to reduce emissions voluntarily \u2014 then the promise of natural gas as a cleaner fuel could well go unrealized. \u201cIt\u2019s the moment of truth,\u201d says Fred Krupp, the president of the Environmental Defense Fund and a strong proponent of regulating emissions.That, to be blunt, is never going to happen. The natural gas boom that has resulted from fracking has become hugely important to the American economy, providing jobs and a plentiful supply of a low-cost fuel. President Obama himself is on record as being pro-natural gas.In February, Colorado became the first state in the nation to impose regulations on the natural gas industry aimed at reducing methane emissions. The regulations included using valves that don\u2019t allow methane to leak, regular checks and repairs of leaks and a variety of other rules. Four of the largest natural gas developers in the state supported the regulations \u2014 in part because they saw the public relations value in it, but also because the regulations Colorado imposed made sense. \u201cWhat we were looking for were rules that wouldn\u2019t just add paperwork or documentation but would make a quantifiable difference,\u201d said Doug Hock, a spokesman for the Encana Corporation, one of the companies that supported the regulations. He noted that the company was already using, in Wyoming, a special infrared camera that detects methane leaks \u2014 which is now required by Colorado \u2014 and \u201cwe could see the benefit of the rules.\u201d He added, \u201cIt really puts a very disciplined process around regular maintenance.\u201dThe problem, however, is that while fracking is currently regulated by the states, not every state is rushing to follow Colorado\u2019s lead. What\u2019s more, there are an enormous number of companies in the fracking business \u2014 literally thousands. Fracking practically screams out for federal regulation.Is industry pushing back? Of course. But oil and gas companies should be welcoming sensible regulation. There is so much mistrust of fracking in the country that rules that made the process demonstrably safer could well have the effect of ameliorating some of that mistrust.Smart regulation to reduce methane emissions could help industry \u2014 and help the planet as well.

{"Headline": "The Rebirth of Tijuana ", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionTijuana, Mexico \u2014 IN Tijuana the other day, I met a waitress named Mari.Mari had left her home in Acapulco to cross illegally into the United States in 1999, but was deported three years ago to Tijuana. It had been a long time since she had seen her mother, so she went home to visit. But down in Acapulco, wages were low, work was scarce and violence was widespread. Then men raped her on a beach one night.Mari fled back to Tijuana. Her waitress job, with tips, she told me, allows her to earn far more than she could scrape together in Acapulco, or in a Monterrey factory, where she worked for a time. And, after several years of savage drug violence, there\u2019s peace in Tijuana now.\u201cThis is my land of opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s more work here and it pays better.\u201dOne reason I love Tijuana is that you can have this kind of conversation here.Tijuana is not pretty. A city of 1.3 million people, it is chaotic, grimy, unplanned, loud, and it smells bad. It possesses none of the colonial architecture or history of Morelia, Oaxaca City or Zacatecas, across Mexico\u2019s interior. On the contrary, most of its neighborhoods, stacked across alarmingly steep hills, are less than 40 years old.But Tijuana\u2019s beauty lies deeper, and has to do with why the town is flourishing now.Only a few decades ago, Tijuana was a blank slate, a small coastal outpost on the California border. It had none of the old elites, family business groups bent on preserving their power and wealth. Instead, it was folks beaten down by Mexico who came by the millions to, and often through, Tijuana. Desperate and possessing only their own wits and capacity for work, they brought a dynamism that Mexico had stifled but Tijuana found use for. Those who stayed found a new world and many moved up into the middle class in a lifetime. It helped that Tijuana is the Mexican city farthest from Mexico City. Tijuana tolerated far less of the desiccated pomp and protocol, the reverence for title, that has suffocated so many fine ideas and sharp minds in the capital, which is the center of the country in almost every way, good and bad. To be far from Mexico City, particularly to the north, was once considered to be virtually not Mexican at all. Federal bureaucrats from Mexico City for years only unwillingly left the center of power. They were paid extra to go to Tijuana. But that distance gave Tijuana oxygen. There\u2019s an old saying about Mexico: So far from God, so close to the United States. There\u2019s some truth to that. But the last few decades have shown that, for poor Mexicans, the truer riff is, \u201cFarther from Mexico City, closer to God.\u201d Immigrants, fleeing north for decades, have demonstrated that. So has Tijuana, which has been Mexico\u2019s best domestic factory at turning the poor into the middle class.Crucially, of course, the city is face-planted up against the United States. Early in the town\u2019s history, in fact, it was easier to get to Tijuana from San Diego than from elsewhere in Mexico, where the winding road from Mexicali took most cars a week. Until several decades ago, Tijuana used dollars, not pesos.Ties to the Southern California economy created so many new chances that a poor, ambitious guy couldn\u2019t help but find something new to do with his life. In Tijuana, risk-taking usually paid off. Among the first to learn that were the yeseros \u2014 the plaster-statue makers. They learned to shape plaster into everything from bulls to Mickey Mouse, and created an industry selling them to tourists. The misbehavior of drunk and horny Americans was also an opportunity for someone looking for an angle, and many grabbed it.But Tijuana drew more from the United States than the dollars of debauched American tourists. Tijuanans had the graciousness to overlook tourists\u2019 behavior as they peered north and glimpsed a different way of doing almost everything \u2014 art, business, government, education. Today, the city has a deeper tradition of private giving than most in Mexico, where the central government discouraged philanthropy, seeing it as competition to its own power. Listening to San Diego public broadcasting, and drawing from the example of nonprofit arts groups there, Tijuana\u2019s middle classes have created one of Mexico\u2019s most vibrant opera scenes. They did this with very little government assistance \u2014 a rarity among Mexican arts groups. Their Opera in the Street Festival attracts close to 10,000 people every July. It takes place a few blocks from the wall between the two countries in Colonia Libertad, a vast neighborhood where the city\u2019s human smuggling industry first took root and many houses have that sagging-wedding-cake look.Tijuana does have a brutal, cynical side. Rural folks fled their destitute villages in Mexico\u2019s interior. But in Tijuana, they were quickly mashed into an industrial work force, living in shantytowns without basic services such as sewers or drinking water, and doing tedious production-line work assembling goods for American consumers.IN addition, Mexico\u2019s corrupt political culture and American tourists\u2019 taste for the forbidden allowed a sinister underworld to develop, trafficking people and substances to gringos. For a while, this side of Tijuana strangled the city.By 2007, the reigning Arellano F\u00e9lix family\u2019s drug cartel was disintegrating, and a fight for control ensued. Bodies piled up. Evil men emerged. One\u2019s nickname was El Muletas \u2014 Crutches \u2014 because he left people crippled. Another cartel member was known as El Pozolero \u2014 the Soupmaker. His job was to dissolve the corpses of rivals in a chemical soup; he admitted to liquefying some 300 bodies when he was captured in 2009. Tijuana was paralyzed by curfews, kidnappings of doctors and dentists, and reports of mass slaughters. American tourists ceased coming. Many in the middle class fled.But the medieval bloodshed receded in 2010, and since then the town\u2019s open and effervescent essence has revived.Most shops selling velvet paintings and naked-lady playing cards died after the Americans stopped coming. But the tourist drag, Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n, is now repopulating with daring restaurants, microbreweries, boutiques and art galleries. They are owned by hipsters using the strip\u2019s now cheap rents, and the confident risk-taking culture that Tijuana handed down to them, to cater to the local market of middle-class young people just like them. Ecosystems of high-tech start-ups and avant-garde artists are emerging. So, too, is a new generation of filmmakers, using Canon 60Ds to mine the documentary raw material the city offers. Decades after rising from the coastal desert, Tijuana finally has something like a history. More important, it has emerged from its darkest days to return to its roots as that rare place within Mexico where poor people like Mari can find refuge and a future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Commissioners Approved for E.U.\u2019s Executive Branch", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Lawmakers on Wednesday approved a new set of commissioners for the European Union\u2019s executive branch, ending months of sometimes acrimonious debate over the administrative direction of the 28-nation bloc.In a speech to the European Parliament before the vote, Mr. Juncker acknowledged that the next five years \u2014 the length of the new commission\u2019s term \u2014 would be the \u201clast chance\u201d to get citizens of the bloc\u2019s member countries to fully support the concept of European unity.Last week, Mr. Juncker said that Maros Sefcovic of Slovakia was his new nominee to oversee energy policy. Mr. Sefcovic had originally been intended to manage transportation matters, but that role now goes to Violeta Bulc of Slovenia.Each of the European Union\u2019s member countries is allowed one person on the commission.Among its many roles, the commission has the sole right to initiate European legislation and the power to enforce treaties by suing member governments at the Court of Justice of the European Union.Frans Timmermans, a former foreign minister of the Netherlands, becomes first vice president and will serve as Mr. Juncker\u2019s deputy.Federica Mogherini, the Italian foreign minister, becomes the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, taking over from Catherine Ashton of Britain.After the vote on Wednesday, Mr. Juncker said it was \u201ctime to roll up our sleeves and get down to work: to kick-start economic recovery, create more and better jobs, address the plight of Europe\u2019s youth for a better future, protect the most vulnerable in our society and cope with the rapidly deteriorating geopolitical situation.\u201dThe European Union has its origins in the 1950s, after World War II, but it has recently come under strong pressure from populist and anti-European movements, particularly in countries like France and Britain. Those movements, which won record numbers of seats in the Parliament in elections in May, say that institutions like the commission have been ineffective at controlling migration and managing the economy.During the proceedings on Wednesday morning, some lawmakers waved placards opposing austerity, the tough budgetary discipline endorsed by Mr. Juncker\u2019s predecessor, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso.Austerity measures, which emphasize deficit reduction over stimulus spending, helped prevent debt-ridden countries like Greece and Cyprus from being forced to leave the euro currency union, but also forced many Europeans into economic hardship.Wednesday\u2019s parliamentary session had a helping of hostile statements. Nigel Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party, said Britain would no longer be part of the European Union by the end of Mr. Juncker\u2019s term. And Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, a far-right French party, said Mr. Juncker would do too little to protect Europe from the forces of globalization.Philippe Lamberts, a president of the Greens bloc in the Parliament, said his group could not vote in favor of Mr. Juncker\u2019s commission because its platform did not go far enough to \u201cre-establish the trust of our citizens in the nascent European democracy\u201d or to tackle rising inequality.At least one analyst agreed with Mr. Juncker\u2019s statement that the European Union has reached a pivotal moment. \u201cJuncker is right that the next five years are decisive,\u201d Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a research group based in Brussels, said Wednesday. \u201cWe have to create jobs to keep the support of citizens for the E.U.\u201d\u201cTo convince national policy makers of the need to act,\u201d Mr. Wolff said, Mr. Juncker would need to focus on harnessing financing from institutions like the European Investment Bank and use his diplomatic skills.In scrutinizing the candidacy of Mr. Hill as commissioner for financial regulation, lawmakers expressed concern about the potential for conflicts of interest because of Mr. Hill\u2019s work as a lobbyist for a company with financial services clients.Some also expressed skepticism because Mr. Hill is a close ally of Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. Mr. Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union if he wins the country\u2019s general election next May.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volatility Unlikely to Alter Fed\u2019s Policy Course ", "Date": "2014-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is watching carefully as financial markets bounce around, but the likely course of monetary policy remains the same, officials have said in recent public comments and interviews.The Fed still intends to finish its bond-buying campaign at the end of the month. And it is still likely to start raising interest rates in mid-2015, although it now seems a little less likely that the Fed would act sooner, and more likely it would wait longer.\u201cJust based on a short period of volatility, that\u2019s not enough for me to make much of an adjustment,\u201d Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cWe need more time to evaluate whether we should be doing any updating. And I would say the financial market movements have not been triggered by very many real economic indicators.\u201dMr. Rosengren and other Fed officials say it is possible the market gyrations, and a downturn in inflation expectations, are early indications that they have once again overestimated the recovery. But the bulk of recent data has been more upbeat, and they see little harm in waiting for more information.\u201cThe stock market is much more volatile than the economy,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a research note to clients last week. \u201cSooner or later, then, the incoming data will calm the markets\u2019 apparent growth fears, and talk of the Fed not beginning to tighten until 2016 will fade away.\u201dThe Fed has methodically pulled back from bond-buying over the last nine months. It plans to add a final $15 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities during October. Officials have pointed to the steady decline of the unemployment rate as evidence the economy no longer needs quite as much help.In recent weeks, however, market measures of inflation expectations have fallen sharply. On Friday, a measure called the break-even rate, which is derived from asset prices, implied annual inflation would run around 1.37 percent over the next five years.The decline may show investors have growing doubts the Fed will meet its stated goal of 2 percent annual inflation. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told Bloomberg News last week that the Fed should consider delaying the end of its bond-buying program.Such a decision would show that \u201cwe are watching and we\u2019re ready and we are willing to do things to defend our inflation target,\u201d Mr. Bullard said.But that view appears to command little support among other Fed officials, in part because market-based measures are viewed as relatively foggy.Mr. Rosengren noted that the measures, which compare Treasury securities with other assets, can also move because of changes in the perceived risks of those assets. Reminders of Europe\u2019s malaise have driven a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in recent weeks, as investors have piled into low-risk assets like Treasuries. \u201cTrying to draw inflation expectations from market prices is perilous,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said. \u201cWe need more time, and if it\u2019s a flight to safety that\u2019s a different story than if it\u2019s a story that inflation expectations are becoming unhinged.\u201dJohn C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in an interview with Reuters last week that if the Fed did decide more stimulus was needed, he would prefer to respond first by delaying interest-rate increases.That view is shared by most Fed officials, Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote last week. \u201cWe believe Williams\u2019 preference for communication about the expected path of the funds rate instead of more asset purchases is reflective of the majority attitude on the committee,\u201d he said. Officials are similarly doubtful that recent market volatility reflects a change in the underlying economy \u2014 or that it will have broad economic consequences.\u201cWhen risk assets dropped last summer, all financial conditions tightened sharply: credit spreads widened, equities fell and yields spiked,\u201d analysts at Barclays Capital pointed out in a note to clients last week. That has not happened this time.Indeed, some Fed officials had suggested in recent months that a little more volatility would be a good thing, helping to discourage excessive risk-taking.Concerns about persistently low inflation, however, may be reducing the chances that the Fed would start raising rates before the middle of the year. Mr. Williams, an influential centrist, told Reuters he still thought a midyear increase was most likely, but that the greater risk was now that the Fed would need to wait longer.By the Fed\u2019s preferred measure, an index of personal consumption expenditures, inflation was just 1.5 percent over the 12 months that ended Aug. 31. Most of the 17 members of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee predicted in September that inflation would not increase to 2 percent in either of the next two years.\u201cThey\u2019re all basically showing that we\u2019re getting close to our goal in terms of slack being reduced,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s significant.\u201dMs. Mester also said she was \u201cnot too disturbed\u201d by the persistence of sluggish inflation. She said she still expected inflation to return to the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target, but that \u201cinflation is a gradual process.\u201dCharles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has made a similar case less pointedly. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Household Debt and Signs of Drought Squeeze Economy in Thailand", "Date": "2014-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDOI SAKET, Thailand \u2014 The junta that seized power in Thailand four months ago has used martial law and a crackdown on its critics to subdue the politically polarized country.But it may have more difficulty handling a fragile economy.Household debt is at a record high in Thailand, exports are flat, the number of tourists is well below last year\u2019s count and experts say low levels at dams across the country are foretelling a severe water shortage. The central bank predicts economic growth of 1.5 percent this year.For the country\u2019s millions of rice farmers, many of whom supported the government that the military overthrew, debt and a shortage of water are a one-two punch.Last month, the local authorities asked Ampai Chaito and other rice farmers here in the northern province of Chiang Mai to abandon plans to plant a second crop this year because the water in a nearby dam was at the lowest level in more than decade. Ms. Ampai fears she may not be able to repay the $6,000 loan she took out last year or pay the college tuition of her son.\u201cHe might not finish his education,\u201d she said angrily after a day\u2019s work in the paddies. \u201cHe\u2019s smart, yes, but he has a poor mother.\u201dAs part of a government stimulus package announced on Wednesday, Ms. Ampai stands to receive the equivalent of about $130, but that is only a small fraction of the money she owes.Adding to Thailand\u2019s unfavorable economic outlook are slowing growth in China, a major trade partner, and weak demand for two of Thailand\u2019s leading exports: computer hard drives and automobiles.\u201cThe economy is the bread and butter of legitimacy,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University. \u201cWhen it comes to politics, the military can command and control \u2014 they have very little open opposition. But they cannot control the world economy. And they cannot control the weather.\u201dIn a country with seven million farming households, mostly small landholders, the water shortage will affect the poorer segment of the population.Kuakoon Manasumphunsakul, a senior technician in the irrigation department of Chiang Mai Province, says the flow of runoff into dams is half the historical average because of an inadequate number of storms during the rainy season, which ends in about a month. \u201cWe have to be prepared for a drought \u2014 it\u2019s definitely going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start saving water, it will be severe.\u201dThe dam closest to the city of Chiang Mai is at 17 percent capacity, the second-lowest level since it was built two decades ago.Although the water shortage appears to be mostly the result of lighter rainfall this year \u2014 dams in Thailand\u2019s southern neighbor Malaysia are also sharply below their average levels \u2014 Nipon Poapongsakorn, an expert on rice cultivation at the Thailand Development Research Institute, says the problem has been amplified by decisions of the previous government to release too much water from dams over the last two years to avoid a repeat of the devastating floods of 2011.Now the prospect of drought is leading to what Mr. Kuakoon calls \u201cwater wars\u201d among the hotels and residents in cities, factories in industrial areas and farmers in the countryside.In addition to the north of the country, the authorities have warned farmers in the rice basket of the country, the basin of the Chao Phraya River, against planting a second crop this year because of the lack of water.Ms. Ampai, the farmer, said the ban on planting rice was announced through the municipal loudspeakers. She now hopes to plant other crops, possibly onions or garlic. But they will also require water from the dam.\u201cIf they don\u2019t release the water, we will go and protest,\u201d Ms. Ampai said. \u201cThey are transferring too much water to the city.\u201dThe Bhumibol Dam, one of the country\u2019s largest and the source of irrigation for a large part of the rice-growing heartland, is at only 40 percent of capacity, a water level seen only three times since it began operations in 1964.The Thai central bank says farmers have among the highest debt levels in the country. But they are by no stretch the only Thais with debt problems.Total household debt has doubled during the last four years, to over 10 trillion baht, or $306 billion, in the second quarter of this year, the equivalent of around 80 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and one of the highest rates in Asia. These numbers do not include the thriving business of black-market loans.Amara Sriphayak, who retired as an assistant governor of the central bank last week, recently warned that debt could cause a \u201chuge decline in household spending rates\u201d and created risks to the country\u2019s financial stability.Pawnshops are a growth industry in cities and towns around the country. The Chiang Mai municipal government opened a fourth pawnshop last year and plans to open another this year.Warisara Suramonthaweekit, manager of a small pawnshop on the outskirts of Chiang Mai, says customers \u201ccome from all walks of life these days.\u201dThe entrance to the shop is cluttered with washing machines and refrigerators dropped off as collateral. Behind the counter is a well-used electric drill pawned for the equivalent of $15 and a television set that was accepted in exchange for a loan of $30.\u201cPeople used to be very ashamed to come here,\u201d Ms. Warisara said. \u201cThey would get someone else to come in their place.\u201dThat shame has dissipated as indebtedness has become so commonplace.\u201cPeople come here just like they would walk into a bank,\u201d Ms. Warisara said.Peak periods at pawnshops include the beginning of the school term, when parents need money for school supplies and fees, and the planting season, when farmers buy their seeds and other materials.Yutthana Rodchaem, a mechanic in the Thai Air Force, drove his motor scooter to a pawnshop in downtown Chiang Mai on a recent afternoon.He pawned a gold necklace for the equivalent of $500 to help pay for his daughter\u2019s university fees.\u201cI\u2019m a low-level civil servant with four children,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is so expensive these days.\u201dPoypiti Amatatham contributed reporting from Bangkok.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Ukraine Vote, a New Test: Burying a Legacy of Dysfunctional Politics", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From UkraineMOSCOW \u2014 For much of its post-Soviet history, the Ukrainian government has been a mud pit of vicious rivalries and sinister back-fighting between presidents and prime ministers, contributing to mismanagement, corruption and even charges of violence. That dysfunction has hobbled the country, leaving it one of the poorest on the European continent and often beholden to the whims of Russia.So the question always lingers over a Kiev government that its citizens have learned to regard as guilty until proven innocent: Will that poisonous legacy come back to snuff out the ideals of Maidan, where hundreds of thousands protested last winter \u2014 and scores died \u2014 demanding a European future?It certainly cast a shadow this week as Ukrainian voters choosing a new Parliament made clear that they wanted President Petro O. Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk to work together to pursue a pro-European course.Although the two men have been allies since the outbreak of mass street protests in Kiev last year, the election also revealed the fault lines of a tense, new rivalry like those that proved so debilitating in the past: between President Viktor A. Yushchenko and his prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko; between Mr. Yushchenko and another prime minister and former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych; and between Mr. Yanukovych and Ms. Tymoshenko, whom he imprisoned.After his party, People\u2019s Front, scored a surprising first-place finish, Mr. Yatsenyuk moved swiftly on Wednesday, declaring that he would take charge of forming the new ruling coalition in Parliament \u2014 proving that he plans not only to keep the prime minister\u2019s job but also to be an equal partner with Mr. Poroshenko in shaping post-Maidan Ukraine.Several analysts said they believed that Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Yatsenyuk were smart enough to avoid the pitfalls of their predecessors.\u201cI believe they can and have gotten along,\u201d Adrian Karatnycky, an expert on Ukraine at the Atlantic Council of the United States, said. \u201cThis is not a repetition of the debilitating Yushchenko-Tymoshenko or Yushchenko-Yanukovych years. Lots of potential for blowups, but in the end, they are kith and kin.\u201d\u201cYatsenyuk and Poroshenko,\u201d Mr. Karatnycky said, \u201care the most competent leaders Ukraine has ever had.\u201dOthers, however, see reason for apprehension and not only because of the country\u2019s troubled past.Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Yatsenyuk failed to reach an agreement to campaign in the parliamentary elections under a single-party umbrella. Among the nation\u2019s political elite, it became generally well understood that Mr. Poroshenko was hoping to replace Mr. Yatsenyuk with Volodymyr Groysman, a deputy prime minister and close personal ally from Vinnytsia, where the president grew up.By some accounts, negotiations to form a single party broke down after disputes over how many appointments to the government, known as the Cabinet of Ministers, each man would control. By other accounts, the talks collapsed in a petty clash over the party name.\u201cIt\u2019s politics now, and each of them wants to be the main person,\u201d said one Ukrainian political insider who has had dealings with both men and spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to be seen as taking sides.Though Mr. Poroshenko ultimately won control of more seats in Parliament, the People\u2019s Front led by Mr. Yatsenyuk edged out the president\u2019s Bloc Petro Poroshenko in party balloting, 22.2 percent to 21.8 percent, according to the returns.Under the current Constitution, the prime minister has much more authority over the day-to-day operations of the government, though the president is head of state and controls the military and foreign policy.By personality, Mr. Poroshenko, a billionaire confectionary magnate, and Mr. Yatsenyuk, a wonkish technocrat well-liked by Western colleagues, are extremely different from their predecessors, who often reflected a Slavic imperiousness.Some analysts said that one of the clear messages of Sunday\u2019s election was that voters do not want a single figure dominating all aspects of the government, as was the case with President Yanukovych.Alyona Getmanchuk, the director of the World Policy Institute, a political research organization in Kiev, and others said this was one reason to be optimistic that Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Yatsenyuk would work as a team.\u201cPeople\u2019s Front did so well because for many people it was an election for prime minister, not a Parliament,\u201d Ms. Getmanchuk said. \u201cThey wanted Yatsenyuk reappointed, and the most important is that they didn\u2019t want Poroshenko to monopolize power. They didn\u2019t want a Yanukovych-lite scenario when a president grabs all the power including the government and Parliament.\u201dThe surprise first-place finish of People\u2019s Front has clearly emboldened him, while at the same time delivering a reality check to Mr. Poroshenko.At a news conference on Wednesday in Kiev, Mr. Yatsenyuk said that he was seizing the initiative in forming the new majority, but stressed that it would be a partnership with Mr. Poroshenko.With a war against pro-Russian separatists still simmering in the east and its economy ever on the brink of collapse, Ukraine faces several tough months ahead, including the prospect of painful austerity measures that Mr. Yatsenyuk is expected to take the lead in formulating. In that sense, his success at the ballot box could prove to be a huge benefit for Mr. Poroshenko.Should the government\u2019s popularity dwindle in several months, or should it fail to meet public expectations, Mr. Yatsenyuk could end up taking the blame and being forced to resign.That would not only deflect the heat from Mr. Poroshenko but also allow him to name Mr. Groysman as prime minister.For now, though, the president\u2019s plans for Mr. Groysman have been put on hold. \u201cThere have been assumptions that he would like to see his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Volodymyr Groysman as prime minister, and they even went to Europe together,\u201d Andryi Pavlovsky, a member of Parliament from Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s Fatherland Party, said. \u201cBut the election results undermined his plans.\u201dNevertheless, Taras Berezovets, a political consultant in Ukraine, said that viewing the election as a setback for the president was a mistake. \u201cWe are not talking about Poroshenko\u2019s defeat,\u201d he said. \u201cThe high result for People\u2019s Front is because some of the president\u2019s supporters voted for Yatsenyuk and so for a new deal between the president and prime minister.\u201d\u201cNobody wants monopolization of power,\u201d Mr. Berezovets said. \u201cAs for rivalry,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no sign of jealousy so far.\u201dGeoffrey R. Pyatt, the United States ambassador to Ukraine, expressed a similar view in a radio interview on Wednesday. \u201cWhat I see,\u201d Mr. Pyatt said, \u201cis an election that has helped draw Ukraine together.\u201dDaniel Rzhenetskyy contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine, and Alexandra Odynova from Moscow.Advertisement"}

Major indexes drifted to a slight loss, leaving the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down 1.6 percent for September, its third monthly drop this year.The market spent the day wavering between minor gains and losses, but there were some big moves beneath the surface. Crude oil prices plunged, dragging down Chevron and other oil and gas companies. And shares of eBay jumped after the company announced plans to spin off PayPal. Trading has turned choppy in recent weeks. Lingering concerns over conflicts around the world, corporate profits and the strength of the global economy have all played a role, said Robert G.

Investors are also wary of the fact that some of the market\u2019s worst swoons in the past have occurred in September and October.\u201cPeople are unsure at this time of the year,\u201d Mr. Pavlik said. \u201cWe\u2019re heading into October.

The S.&P. 500 reached a record high on Sept. 18, supported by news of stronger economic growth and reassuring words from Federal Reserve officials about keeping interest rates low.

{"Headline": "From Jimmy Carter, a Rebuke to Egypt ", "Date": "2014-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOver three decades, the Carter Center in Atlanta, led by former President Jimmy Carter, has established itself as a respected advocate for human rights and democracy. It has sent observers to 97 elections in 38 countries, worked to persuade governments to respect freedoms and human rights, and supported citizens who defend those principles. But it has thrown in the towel on Egypt. The center\u2019s withering judgment is a damning critique of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a former general who overthrew President Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist allied with the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2013. It also sends two powerful messages to the Obama administration. One is that playing down Mr. Sisi\u2019s repressive tactics is bound to backfire and drive aggrieved Egyptians to violence and extremism, destabilizing both Egypt and the region.Washington is obviously concerned about upsetting an important Arab ally that honors its peace treaty with Israel and permits expedited passage through the vital Suez Canal. But at some point the United States must draw a line. It would also be helpful if Israel, which prides itself on its democracy and has productive ties with Mr. Sisi, encouraged him to abandon the authoritarian course he has followed ever since he got himself elected president in a rigged vote in 2014. Mr. Sisi has cracked down on dissidents, opposition groups and journalists, including three respected professionals working for Al Jazeera. The Carter Center expressed alarm about the mass arrests of Brotherhood leaders and supporters, whom Egypt has unfairly branded as terrorists. More than 16,000 people are in jail for political reasons; more than 1,000 were killed during protests. Nongovernmental interest groups of all kinds, including the Carter Center, obviously have cause for alarm. But so do all Egyptians who do not toe Mr. Sisi\u2019s authoritarian line, and that cannot possibly instill confidence in the foreign investors and tourists who are vital to rebuilding Egypt\u2019s troubled economy. America must do what it can to persuade Mr. Sisi to abandon this dangerous course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President of Bolivia Claims Victory in Election ", "Date": "2014-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 President Evo Morales of Bolivia said Sunday night that he had won a third consecutive term, although electoral authorities were slow to reveal vote totals. Mr. Morales\u2019s re-election was widely anticipated, and the president, who faced a fractured opposition, was propelled by a buoyant economy and a sustained drop in poverty in one of the region\u2019s poorest countries.Mr. Morales announced his victory in a speech from the balcony of a government building in one of the main public squares of La Paz, saying, \u201cThis victory is the victory of the anti-colonialists and the anti-imperialists.\u201d He suggested that he had received more than 60 percent of the vote while a crowd chanted his name. Mr. Morales held a strong lead in public opinion polls going into Sunday\u2019s election and had four candidates running against him. He was also aided by the economy\u2019s growth of more than 6 percent last year, driven by strong internal demand and natural gas sales to two of the country\u2019s neighbors, Brazil and Argentina.Mr. Morales, 54, who after first taking office in 2006 exerted more control over foreign oil and gas companies and raised the taxes and royalties that they pay, has also spent on infrastructure, building roads and an aerial cable-car system connecting La Paz with El Alto, a fast-growing sister city. Social programs include payments to the families of young students and increased pensions for the elderly.Today one in five people in the country of about 10.5 million lives in extreme poverty, compared with more than a third of the population in 2006, according to the national statistics office.Mr. Morales, an Aymara Indian who was born into poverty, is a leftist allied with Venezuela\u2019s socialist-inspired government. He has frequently clashed with the United States, expelling the American ambassador in 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2009 and the United States Agency for International Development last year.But he has been far more pragmatic than his Venezuelan allies in his management of the economy. Bolivia has emerged from years of economic fragility to hold impressive foreign reserves and modest debt. After years of coups and failed governments, Mr. Morales has established an unusual level of political stability.A new term for Mr. Morales would keep him in the presidency until 2020. The Constitution bars him from seeking re-election after that. But many in Bolivia wonder whether he or his party will seek a constitutional change that would allow him to run again, as his ally Hugo Ch\u00e1vez did in Venezuela and as another leftist, Rafael Correa, appears set to do in Ecuador.Like other leftist leaders in the region, Mr. Morales has been criticized for undermining democratic safeguards, like the independence of the judiciary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy and France Blink in Budget Battle With European Union", "Date": "2014-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 France and Italy avoided a political collision with the European Union on Tuesday when officials in Brussels indicated that they would approve the countries\u2019 2015 budgets after last-minute adjustments in the spending plans.The budget tweaks will still not enable France and Italy to bridge the deficit gaps that had risked prompting Brussels to reject their budgets \u2014 with potentially damaging results for European Union diplomacy. But the concessions by Paris and Rome appeared to be enough to defuse the issue and avoid a confrontation just as a new executive body is about to assume power in Brussels.In effect, the French and Italians have promised to make serious budget-cutting efforts, and officials in Brussels have agreed to believe them.\u201cI want to welcome the fact that these member states have responded constructively to our concerns,\u201d Jyrki Katainen, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said in a statement from Brussels. He added that he could not \u201cimmediately identify\u201d any serious shortcomings in revised budget proposals.The matter is not merely academic accounting. The eurozone economy stagnated in the second quarter and there have been indications that it might be headed back to recession. The ability of France and Italy \u2014 the eurozone\u2019s second- and third-largest economies, after Germany \u2014 to try to stimulate their economies rather than focus on budget cuts could be crucial to the speed of any eurozone recovery.Wednesday was to have been the deadline for the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, to approve or reject the budgets. But Mr. Katainen\u2019s statement indicated that the commission would study the budget plans and offer its opinion sometime in November.That would seem to effectively hand the matter over to the new European Commission that is about to take office \u2014 and whose top economic official will be Pierre Moscovici. Until April, he was the finance minister of France.France in particular raised the stakes early this month with a temporary declaration of independence from the European Union\u2019s rules that would have required it to achieve a 2015 budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product. At the time, the government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said such a target would further crimp growth, adding that it \u201crejects austerity.\u201dEuropean officials are well aware of the delicacy of Mr. Hollande\u2019s situation, with a significant part of the French leader\u2019s own Socialist Party in open rebellion against cuts in government spending.The Italian government, under Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, had been less confrontational with Brussels. But Italy had also submitted a budget that, like France\u2019s, would miss a deficit target.Ever since Mr. Renzi took office in February, he has been part of the anti-austerity coalition with France, as well as Spain. Confronted with the challenging task to streamline Italy\u2019s byzantine bureaucracy, Mr. Renzi has often used the word \u201cgrowth\u201d in his speeches to give hope to a country with record-high unemployment rates.In many ways, France and Italy\u2019s dispute is directed at Germany \u2014 whose push for austerity budgets has increasingly put it at odds with the rest of the 18-nation eurozone. Even in the weeks since France made its declaration, and the French and German economy and finance ministers have met in a show of solidarity, Germany has declined to back down from its insistence that European Union budget rules must be enforced, even as Germany\u2019s own economy has stalled.It is unclear how the softening of the European Commission\u2019s position will play in Berlin.After a weekend of meetings in Paris, Mr. Hollande\u2019s government said on Monday that it would respect the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Union agreement that stipulates that member countries must hold their budget deficits to no more than 3 percent of G.D.P.France said it would find as much 3.7 billion euros, or $4.7 billion, in new budget cuts next year, the government said. That will not meet the 3 percent deficit target, but it come much closer than before. The new plan assumes lower interest payments on France\u2019s debt, as well as new measures to catch tax cheats and close some tax loopholes.\u201cI think that France has presented the details and elements that will allow it to remain within bounds,\u201d Finance Minister Michel Sapin told news agencies on Monday.In Rome on Monday, Mr. Renzi\u2019s government announced its own last-minute budget savings, saying that it had managed to find \u20ac4.5 billion of new measures. Italy will still not meet the deficit target Brussels is looking for, but, like France, it will come closer.In a letter to the European Commission, the Italian economy minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, said Italy would eliminate \u20ac3.3 billion of planned tax cuts, among other steps.But many economists argue that more government spending, not less, is what the European economy needs now and that a confluence of weak growth and worrisomely low inflation justify at least a temporary change of course.With the job market in the doldrums and consumer spending tepid, there is little scope for the private sector to provide the demand Europe needs to break out of stagnation.Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London, said the French plans did \u201cnot sum up to major fiscal tightening.\u201d\u201cThe commission and other member states may exert further pressure on France to do more tightening or at least impose more structural reforms,\u201d Mr. Schulz said, but \u201ctough punitive action against France remains unlikely.\u201dThe compromise reached with Brussels on Tuesday is unlikely to end the austerity debate, however.\u201cThe Italian economy is going through one of the most severe and lengthy recessions in its history,\u201d Mr. Padoan wrote in his letter to the commission, noting that the country\u2019s G.D.P. had declined by 9 percent since 2008. \u201cA fourth year of recession is to be avoided by all means as it would be extremely problematic to pull the country out of such an economic environment.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}

And will the recent market volatility prove ultimately inconsequential, or does it presage harder times ahead for a nation still trying to muddle its way out of a downturn that technically ended more than five years ago?In other words, does Wall Street know something that the rest of us don\u2019t?There are some reasons that, unnerving as these market moves have been, people who do not trade stocks and bonds for a living should still feel reasonably good about where things stand. Yes, the market sell-off on Wednesday was driven partly by a weak reading on United States retail sales, which fell 0.3 percent in September. But some of the most direct effects of the market action are actually positives for ordinary Americans.The price of oil is down about 20 percent since summer, which is making a wide range of fuels less expensive. Gasoline now averages $3.18 a gallon, down 14 percent since the spring, according to data from AAA. A slump in the prices of agricultural commodities like corn, soybeans and wheat should, over time, make trips to the grocery store cheaper.And with money gushing away from risky investments like stocks into safer bonds, long-term interest rates have fallen steeply; the yield on a 10-year Treasury note briefly dipped below 2 percent on Wednesday morning, the lowest it has been in more than a year. (It closed the day at 2.13 percent.) Those lower rates are likely to be passed through in the form of lower home mortgage interest rates, which could bolster a still-struggling housing market. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 4.13 percent on Tuesday, according to Bankrate.com, a number that could tumble further as the latest bond market moves are priced into consumer mortgages.But perhaps the overriding message is that this market sell-off, to the degree it is a sell-off at all (the S.&P. 500 decline of 7.4 percent was matched by a similar fall in late 2012), may be bringing market prices more in line with the brutal realities of the economy.So the correction may not be about Wall Street knowing something about the outlook for the future that the rest of us do not, but rather about markets adjusting to more realistically reflect economic reality. Yes, things have improved, but maybe not enough to justify stock prices that are quite so high relative to corporate earnings.\u201cDue to excessive confidence in central banks, investors eagerly decoupled high market valuations from what was warranted by the sluggish fundamentals,\u201d said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser of Allianz, the financial services company. That disconnect, he said, has been undermined over the last few weeks by signs that the global economy\u2019s fundamentals are weaker than they seemed and concern that the European Central Bank will not adequately fight that continent\u2019s economic drift.The renewed bout of volatility partly reverses a trend through the first half of the year in which almost all global assets \u2014 both safe ones like Treasury bonds and risky ones like stocks and real estate \u2014 were increasing in value. Now money is shifting out of risky assets and toward the safe ones, which is a more normal pattern.There is a big question, though, as to what, if anything, global policy makers ought to do about it. Fed officials have been clear that they expect to start raising interest rates from their longstanding near-zero levels in the middle of 2015. Until this month, markets have believed them.On Oct. 1, futures markets priced in only about 9 percent odds that the Fed would not raise rates by December 2015. By Wednesday, that had risen to about 40 percent. That means investors are now betting, given the recent declines in stock prices, bond yields and inflation expectations, that Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, and her colleagues at the central bank are quite a bit less likely to follow through with their plans to increase interest rates next year. There have even been some early rumblings of a new round of quantitative easing, or bond buying (the previous round is set to end in the weeks ahead).The decision whether to increase interest rates next year will be Ms. Yellen\u2019s first big test in a tenure as chairwoman that began in February, but has thus far largely carried out policies shaped by her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke.The quandary for Ms. Yellen, and for anyone reading scary headlines about the latest market moves, is this: Are these the kinds of routine gyrations on Wall Street that can be safely ignored? Or are they a signal that something is seriously wrong and the Fed needs to re-evaluate the path it has embarked on?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Market-Driven Behavior", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Roberts\u2019s criticism centers on two distinct threats to a society that aims to be responsible, self-governing and interested in the well-being of future generations. The first threat comes from the power of distraction \u2014 deployed by the market for its own purposes \u2014 which disables us from attending to obligations and even from practicing ordinary prudence. Roberts cites a study that found that people remember the price of things bought with credit cards far less precisely than the price paid in cash. Time we spend looking into an iPad window to choose among 20 deals on jackets is time we might give to looking out of another kind of window and doing something about climate disruption. A second threat to personal autonomy and social responsibility comes, Roberts says, from our desire for immediate gratification in everything we do, from validating our political opinions to finding the nearest coffee shop. His comments on distraction and on immediacy are pertinent and help to characterize something that has gone badly wrong with American morale in the last 30 years or so. Yet Roberts often treats these separate dangers as if they were the same. Under the heading of \u201cimmediate gratification,\u201d he adduces the iPhone digital assistant Siri, who speaks to her owner in humanoid tones \u2014 the first generation of the dematerialized robot whose 10th generation may be the operating system depicted in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d The hero of that movie becomes attached to his system, a cute and upbeat voice with an amusing robot brain, and soon finds he enjoys her company with a cheerful gratitude he could never feel for a human partner. Are his feelings right or wrong? If the robot simulates a human entity and elicits a human response, what basis do we have for criticizing the transaction? The answer depends on ideas about human dignity, reciprocal relationships and the examined life, which the very comforts of technology have made harder for people to dwell on. A journalist and the author of \u201cThe End of Oil\u201d and \u201cThe End of Food,\u201d Roberts says his politics have not changed; he was and remains a political liberal. But his diagnosis of the impulse society has led him to \u201cconclusions that are distinctly conservative.\u201d This is less mysterious than he thinks. A conservative may have much in common with a conservationist. \u201cI do not like,\u201d Edmund Burke wrote, \u201cto see any thing destroyed; any void produced in society; any ruin on the face of the land.\u201d If you look on society as a product of human energy that has become a second nature to us, the environment we have to care for includes society itself, as well as the natural world of mountains, lakes and forests. Much of \u201cThe Impulse Society\u201d is a history of the run-up to the financial collapse of 2008. A long-term deterioration of morale was necessary to open the financial market to devices of toxic ingenuity like collateralized debt obligations, which the too-big-to-fail banks sliced and diced and sold to the wise and credulous alike. The corporate raiders of the 1970s and 1980s, Roberts argues, were early adventurers on the same path; corrupt practices in which they engaged, including stock buybacks, did permanent harm to a sense of the common good that once cut across social classes. The company town has almost vanished from American life. More than two million factory jobs were lost between 1979 and 1983, and recovery from the recessions of the 21st century has not been followed by a return of jobs. Why not? Because companies and shareholders found that \u201cthe return on technology was better than the return on people.\u201d Manufacturing has fallen from 25 percent of the economy in 1970 to 12 percent today. Between the 1970s and the early 2000s, when stock options and other compensation packages became common, the average chief executive went from being paid 20 times as much as the median employee to being paid 400 times as much. \u201cThe Impulse Society\u201d bears a generally reformist message, supported by uneven rows of miscellaneous facts. Its argument would be clearer if its definitions were sharper. The book\u2019s publicity compares it to \u201cThe Culture of Narcissism,\u201d by Christopher Lasch \u2014 an absorbing study of the decline of the autonomous personality, widely discussed when it appeared in 1979 \u2014 but Roberts says little in depth about personal or social pathology. A fairer book for comparison would be \u201cThe Acquisitive Society,\u201d a critique of the ethics of capitalism published in 1920 by the British historian R. H. Tawney. Corporate and dynastic property rights, Tawney believed, were deleterious unless attached to a social function, a kind of productive work that carried a visible benefit for the whole society. The defense of rights without some such function was a defense of privilege, and \u201cthe definition of a privilege is a right to which no corresponding function is attached.\u201d There you have three words, closely defined by their interrelations: function, right and privilege. Such definitions may work to build a case for the radical reform of society.By contrast, the tendency Roberts calls by the name of \u201cimpulse\u201d covers a multitude of faults. Sometimes it seems another name for convenience \u2014 convenience too quickly and reflexively embraced. But this book also uses \u201cimpulse\u201d as a rough synonym for greed, habit, ambition, delusion, shortsightedness and narrow-\u00admindedness. When Roberts speaks of the hot resentment that characterizes some aspects of the Tea Party, and calls the result \u201cimpulse politics,\u201d he surely underrates the actual force of ideology. \u201cThe Impulse Society\u201d sounds a memorable alarm with its record of disturbing facts and trends, but it leaves us uncertain what path we should follow to escape our predicament, and what end we should have in view.

The result could be a Parliament made up of anywhere between five and eight parties.\u201cIf this scenario materializes, it will be nearly catastrophic because the Parliament will be so fragmented that it will be unable to form a stable cabinet,\u201d said Daniel Smilov of the Center for Liberal Strategies, a policy research center in Sofia, the capital.Bulgaria, where the average monthly wage is $500, continues to lag behind the rest of the European Union.

{"Headline": "In Mexico, a New Lead on Missing Students", "Date": "2014-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOCULA, Mexico \u2014 Mexican investigators planted red flags to mark suspected human remains Tuesday as they combed through a garbage-choked ravine in the search for 43 students missing since they were arrested by the police in the southern city of Iguala a month ago.Yet as the second day of the search outside this forested mountain town closed, there was no sign that the government was any closer to finding the students. On Monday, Attorney General Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam had raised hopes that the dump outside Cocula might hold a clue to the fate of the students, all young men, who the authorities said were handed over to a local drug gang after their arrests.Four suspected members of the gang, known as Guerreros Unidos, had been arrested and provided information on Monday that led them to Cocula, about 30 minutes from Iguala. A day later, Mr. Murillo Karam said that it was too early to speculate on what the Cocula dump might hold. \u201cWe cannot do anything while we don\u2019t have full and clear evidence of what happened here,\u201d he said on Tuesday. The arrests bring to 56 the number of people who have been detained over the students\u2019 disappearance on Sept. 26, including police officers from Iguala and Cocula and gang members.On Tuesday, residents milled around Cocula\u2019s main square, watching police and soldiers drive through. Jorge Luis Mendoza, 25, a farmer, said that the Guerreros Unidos appeared to have control of the region. \u201cFor a year now, violence and crime have really spiked,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople cannot travel the roads by night because you always see gunmen on the roads, armed people just watching you.\u201dStill, even in a town that had become inured to kidnappings, \u201cwe are not used to the police or narcos killing students,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just ugly.\u201dThe disappearance has created a political dilemma for President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has sought to play down the issue of drug violence while he tries to focus on the economy.Yet the search for the students has consumed Mexican public opinion. Their disappearance has set off violent protests in the state of Guerrero, where they were arrested, and demonstrations in much of the country.The unrest forced the resignation of Guerrero\u2019s governor, \u00c1ngel Aguirre, last week. On Tuesday, the government\u2019s security cabinet flew to Acapulco, the state\u2019s largest city, to meet with the interim governor, Rogelio Ortega Mart\u00ednez, a sociologist and former university administrator with a background in the state\u2019s leftist movements.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was scheduled to meet with relatives of the missing students in Mexico City on Wednesday. Although Mexico\u2019s drug war over the past eight years has produced many massacres that have horrified the country, this case has resonated particularly strongly because the investigation has revealed how effectively the gang penetrated the local government.Mr. Murillo Karam said last week that Guerreros Unidos had infiltrated Iguala\u2019s city hall and that the mayor\u2019s wife, Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Pineda Villa, had been identified as the gang\u2019s main contact.Both the mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Abarca, and Ms. Pineda Villa are considered fugitives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Depression Denial Syndrome", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe answer is that Mr. Gross\u2019s fall is a symptom of a malady that continues to afflict major decision-makers, public and private. Call it depression denial syndrome: the refusal to acknowledge that the rules are different in a persistently depressed economy.Mr. Gross is, by all accounts, a man with a towering ego and very difficult to work with. That description, however, fits a lot of financial players, and even the most lurid personality conflicts wouldn\u2019t have mattered if Pimco had continued to do well. But it didn\u2019t, largely thanks to a spectacularly bad call Mr. Gross made in 2011, which continues to haunt the firm. And here\u2019s the thing: Lots of other influential people made the same bad call \u2014 and are still making it, over and over again.The story here really starts years earlier, when an immense housing bubble popped. Spending on new houses collapsed, and broader consumer spending also took a hit, as families that had borrowed heavily to buy houses saw the value of those homes plunge. Businesses cut back, too. Why add capacity in the face of weak consumer demand? The result was an economy in which everyone wanted to save more and invest less. Since everyone can\u2019t do that at the same time, something else had to give \u2014 and, in fact, two things gave. First, the economy went into a slump, from which it has not yet fully emerged. Second, the government began running a deficit, as the economic downturn caused a sharp fall in revenue and a surge in some kinds of spending, like food stamps and unemployment benefits. All this may sound strange and counterintuitive, but it\u2019s what basic macroeconomic analysis tells you. And that\u2019s not 20/20 hindsight either. In 2008-9, a number of economists \u2014 yes, myself included \u2014 tried to explain the special circumstances of a depressed economy, in which deficits wouldn\u2019t cause soaring rates and the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of \u201cprinting money\u201d (not really what it was doing, but never mind) wouldn\u2019t cause inflation. It wasn\u2019t just theory, either; we had the experience of the 1930s and Japan since the 1990s to draw on. But many, perhaps most, influential people in the alleged real world refused to believe us. Which brings me back to Mr. Gross. And that\u2019s what makes the Bill Gross story interesting. He\u2019s pretty much the only major deficit hysteric to pay a price for getting it wrong (even though he remains, of course, immensely rich). Pimco has taken a hit, but everywhere else the reign of error continues undisturbed. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When a Stock Market Theory Is Contagious", "Date": "2014-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewSince Sept. 18, the stock market has fallen more than 6 percent. An abrupt decline last week \u2014 after five years of gains \u2014 prompted fears that the market may have reached a major turning point.Has a bear market begun? It\u2019s a great question. The problem is that short-term market movements are extremely hard to forecast. But we live in the present and must try to understand what\u2019s driving markets now, even if it\u2019s much easier to predict their behavior over the long run. Fundamentally, stock markets are driven by popular narratives, which don\u2019t need basis in solid fact. True or not, such stories may be described as \u201cthought viruses.\u201d When they are pernicious, they are analogous to the Ebola virus: They spread by contagion. Theories that seem to explain the stock market\u2019s direction often work like this: First, they cause investors to take action that propels prices even further in the same direction. These narratives can affect people\u2019s spending behavior, too, in turn affecting corporate profit margins, and so on. Sometimes such feedback loops continue for years.The most prominent story since the September peak seems to be one of a \u201cglobal slowdown\u201d with associated \u201cdeflation.\u201d Underlying this tale are deeper, longer-term fears. There is a name for these concerns too. It is \u201csecular stagnation\u201d \u2014 the idea that there is disturbing evidence that the world economy may languish for a very long time, even for generations, as the word \u201csecular\u201d suggests.Mr. Summers presented his secular-stagnation idea with uncharacteristic diffidence: \u201cThis may all be madness and I may not have this right at all.\u201d But his talk seemed to release a thought virus. Nations\u2019 periods of slow growth can indeed last for decades. But why predict something like that right now, and generalize this prediction for the whole world? Here we do not find consensus, only ideas whose relevance is hard to judge. Some people say a theory of John Maynard Keynes \u2014 known as the \u201cunderconsumptionist theory\u201d because it says people inherently underspend once they become prosperous \u2014 is taking hold. Others say investment opportunities offer lower \u2014 maybe even negative \u2014 returns because the economy no longer requires so much heavy machinery. Still others say that an aging population is a drag on growth, or that the financial disarray left by the 2007-9 crisis is re-emerging. All of these theories have a certain plausibility but hardly offer reason to expect a major turning point in the market right now.There is little talk about secular stagnation in scholarly circles today. The recent chatter has centered in the news media, in conference panel discussions and in the blogosphere. We can contrast this secular stagnation story with the narrative that drove down the stock market in 2011. By May 10 of that year, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index had already doubled since its financial-crisis bottom on March 9, 2009. And then the index fell by about 20 percent from May 2 to Aug. 9.What set off that decline? It had to do with a different thought virus: the worry that Congress wouldn\u2019t raise the debt ceiling in time to prevent the United States from defaulting on its debt. The nation didn\u2019t default, but on Aug. 5, 2011, S.&P. downgraded the national debt for the first time.But that narrative ended when Congress raised the debt ceiling. The stock market soared again, once the news stopped reinforcing that fear of dire consequences.The current secular-stagnation story is less dramatic than that of the debt crisis. But because it\u2019s so vague, the negative feedback loop can\u2019t be resolved as neatly. The question may be whether this thought virus mutates into a more psychologically powerful version, one with enough narrative force to create a major bear market. ROBERT J.

{"Headline": "Hong Kong\u2019s Occupy Generation", "Date": "2014-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHONG KONG \u2014 The dramatic opening of the Occupy Central movement five weeks ago, complete with liberal use of batons, pepper spray and tear gas by the police against unarmed students, triggered a surge of support for the young pro-democracy protesters. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of demonstrators still occupy several of the city\u2019s main traffic arteries, camping out in neat lines of colorful tents. That police brutality unexpectedly heralded the amazing rise of a new socio-political force. Already dubbed the Occupy Central Generation, its members, drawn from the cohorts born during and since the 1980s, are mostly students and young workers, many of them professionals. While also dedicated to democracy and deeply wary of Beijing, they are more localist and have less affinity for the cultural identity of mainland Chinese than their elders, including the original proponents of Occupy Central and stalwarts among Hong Kong\u2019s Pan Democrats, as the pro-democracy camp is known here. Last week, when top government officials held a dialogue on political reform with the protesters, five university students and leaders of the movement were invited as its representatives. The civility displayed by both sides could not mask what was in large measure a generational face-off, and the talks utterly failed to bridge the gap. The officials rejected the students\u2019 demand that candidates for the 2017 election for chief executive, the territory\u2019s top post, could be nominated by independent citizens\u2019 groups. Quoting verbatim from a recent ruling from Beijing, the officials maintained that potential candidates must first be vetted by a nomination committee of 1,200 persons, chosen from specially defined interest groups mostly favorable to Beijing. Neither the student leaders nor the wider public were impressed. There appears to be no easy resolution to the standoff: The government seems hesitant to use force again to end the occupation, and the students are not backing down. Earlier fears that the People\u2019s Liberation Army would come in to do a Tiananmen II have been dispelled by spokesmen carrying word from Beijing. The reason for this self-restraint is obvious: Mainland-controlled companies account for some 60 percent of Hong Kong\u2019s stock market capitalization, and the Communist Party\u2019s princelings own many private equity funds and much prime real estate here. They are in no mood to see a bloodbath in Hong Kong, which could trigger a flight of capital and a collapse of the asset markets. The protesters, for their part, seem resolute. Unlike their parents and grandparents, most of them have grown up middle class in a city-polity with good governance, and mostly during what is widely deemed to be its golden period \u2014 from the late 1970s to the handover in 1997. Well-educated, well-traveled and well-informed, they have a surprisingly strong disdain for what they see in mainland China: an authoritarian government, corrupt, uncivil, lacking in the rule of law and controlled by an elite much inflated with a misbegotten sense of cocky patriotism.These young people have been further alienated in recent years by the intrusion of the mainland\u2019s economic clout, which among other things has driven real estate prices incredibly high. Immigrants from China keep arriving, and young Hong Kongers perceive the government\u2019s preferential treatment of them as depriving locals of educational opportunities, health care and other benefits. They deplore seeing shops that used to serve their daily needs being turned into pricey outlets for well-heeled mainland tourists and bootleggers \u2014 \u201clocusts,\u201d as the latter are sometimes called. In fact, the more young Hong Kongers depend on the mainland economy for employment and income, the more they resent Beijing. A generational fissure also runs through the wider democracy movement itself. Leaders of the biggest pro-democracy parties have for some 30 years endorsed a mild form of pushback against Beijing: mixing struggle with dialogue and accepting the mainland\u2019s sovereignty over Hong Kong in exchange for promises of more democracy. In light of Beijing\u2019s recent hard-line rulings regarding the 2017 election, the Occupy Central Generation looks upon the strategy of its elders as completely futile: They gave away much and got nothing in return. Civil disobedience is this generation\u2019s starting point. This has widened the gulf between the Pan Democrats and the ruling class and explains the new intensity of emotion in the movement. Making things worse is the fact that on the government side stands a chief executive, C.Y. Leung, long seen by many as even more hard-line and divisive than some old-school communists. Mr. Leung enjoys scant support from the local business sector and key players within the civil service. Indeed, in his two years plus as chief executive, Hong Kong society at every level has become more politically polarized than ever. Were the chief executive a person at once responsive to the needs and aspirations of Hong Kong\u2019s people and who knew how to be tactful in Beijing, he could perhaps find a way to resolve the standoff. Some existing electoral laws in China, though rarely applied, provide for forms of nomination by groups of citizens and members of legislative bodies. If these provisions were extended to Hong Kong, it would take the signatures of just 100 registered voters or just three members of the Hong Kong legislature to nominate one candidate in the election for chief executive. But it is not apparent that anyone could persuade Beijing to lend this page in its own playbook to Hong Kongers.For now the Occupy Central movement seems to have entered an equilibrium. The occupied areas contract and expand as police and protesters feel out each other\u2019s bottom line. Occupiers have refined their shift systems. Taxi drivers now know how to circumvent blocked roads. Business has returned to shops in the affected areas. A new normal has set in. This could last until next spring, when the government is to present its political reform bill to the legislature, where the Pan Democrats hold enough seats to defeat it. If they do, Beijing has promised that the next chief executive will be chosen in 2017, as C.Y. Leung was in 2012, by a group of 1,200 special-interest electors. This is a game the pro-government camp certainly knows how to play, but also one that would feed more public discontent. By the time the Occupy Central movement is eventually dissolved \u2014 by force or of its own resolution \u2014 and its leaders make good on their promise to submit themselves to arrest, an entire generation of pro-democracy citizens will have arisen: young and dynamic, dauntless and relentless. It is a force that the Beijing plutocrats and their emissaries in Hong Kong will have trouble getting used to. Political business will no longer be as usual. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Local Food for the Military", "Date": "2014-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLITTLETON, N.C. \u2014 IN big cities and small towns around the United States, people are embracing local agriculture, flocking to farmers\u2019 markets and flocking to \u201clocavore\u201d restaurants, reaping a wide range of nutritional, environmental and economic benefits. Yet one segment of the population is largely missing out on this bounty: the millions of members of the American military and their families.While some service members live off base and buy their food in local stores, most get their food through the military, either directly, by eating at mess halls, or through on-base commissaries. The military maintains a multibillion-dollar system to keep its larders stocked. And almost all that food is bought in vast quantities from enormous agribusiness operations, with little attention paid to where and how it was grown, or how fresh it is. During my time in Congress, from 1992 to 2003, several colleagues and I set out on a fairly simple mission: providing small- and mid-scale farmers, who represent the backbone of rural America, with the opportunity to supply our country\u2019s military. This proved challenging. Obstacles included price pressures, which were not surprising, given the economies of scale realized by large farms, which also could work more easily with the military bureaucracy. There were also requirements that all fruits and vegetables meet \u201cuniformity\u201d standards, meaning the wonderful variety in shapes and sizes you find in farmers\u2019 markets, and often on small- and mid-scale farms, was not allowed.While our efforts to open the door to smaller, more local producers didn\u2019t go anywhere at the time, we are in a different place now than we were 11 years ago. Local farming and the mechanisms for getting its products to consumers have expanded significantly.That\u2019s why Congress and the Department of Defense should tackle this issue anew by mandating that a percentage \u2014 even if it is just 5 or 10 percent \u2014 of a base\u2019s food come from local small- and mid-scale farmers.Doing so would be a boon for everyone. Given the tens of thousands of people who live and work on the average base, even a small share of that market would be a huge benefit for local farmers and military families.The military would benefit as well. There has been an increase in the number of service members who are deemed too heavy to serve. In response, the military has embarked on what it calls the Healthy Base Initiative, aimed at \u201cincreasing the health and wellness of the total force, including civilians and family members\u201d because a \u201chealthy and fit force is essential to national security.\u201d In North Carolina, Fort Bragg is participating in the initiative, and Camp Lejeune has begun a weekly farmers\u2019 market. But the military should think even more creatively. Consider this: Most bases are in rural areas, but many are now being encroached upon by sprawling commercial and residential development, presenting obvious safety and security risks. The military could give financial incentives to small- and mid-scale farmers to buy land adjacent to bases, perhaps by promising to buy a certain percentage of their produce.The military should also loosen its food-uniformity standards. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, 40 percent of our food goes uneaten, a large portion of that because of aesthetic or size irregularities. Since a good deal of the military\u2019s produce is cut, chopped and cooked, blemishes or irregular shapes and sizes don\u2019t matter. If farmers were paid for these products, it would help their bottom lines and help them keep their farms, while also addressing the issue of food waste. And for the military, the lower price of less-than-perfect-looking food from local farms might help offset the additional cost associated with purchasing local products.The military doesn\u2019t have to do this alone. Every state has agricultural organizations and agencies that promote local farmers; partnering with them would allow the military to take advantage of their expertise and connections. In my home state of North Carolina, they include the Center for Environmental Farming Systems, the Eastern Region Military Growth Task Force and the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. On the national level, it includes the Department of Agriculture. The military represents one of the single largest markets for food in the country. If we can open the door just a little to small- and mid-scale food producers, we can do worlds of good for everyone: the farmers, the consumers and the military itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Praise for Greece Fails to Stem Bond Sell-Off", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Just a few months ago, Greece appeared to be on the road to recovery. But in recent days it has helped stir up a storm in European bond markets as investors realized that Athens might not be on such a firm path after all.On Thursday more investors fled Greek bonds, driving the government\u2019s longterm borrowing costs to nearly 9 percent. That was the highest level since January and an increase from 7 percent on Wednesday.Hoping to slow the stampede, the European Union on Thursday praised Greece\u2019s efforts and pledged further assistance. The European Central Bank signaled that it would give Greek banks access to more funding by making it easier for them to use their holdings of government bonds as collateral for low-interest central bank loans.But those reassurances did not stop the Greek bond sell-off from spreading to other nations along Europe\u2019s southern rim, including Portugal, Spain, Italy and France. Even in Ireland, which like Greece and Portugal took part in international bailouts, investors drove interest rates higher on Thursday in a show of panic that was reminiscent of the early days of Europe\u2019s debt crisis.\u201cThere is clearly the potential for contagion similar to what we saw in 2012,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the director for Europe for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm. \u201cPeople have been asking what\u2019s the trigger that will cause things to unwind, and it now seems it\u2019s a combination of concern about Greece, the broader economic environment in the euro area, and a conflict between Germany\u201d and the rest of Europe over budget discipline and the potential remedies for what ails the eurozone.In Brussels, Jyrki Katainen, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, sought to assure investors that Greece\u2019s recovery continued to be on track.\u201cWhile there is a clear need to maintain the momentum of reform, there is strong evidence that the country has now turned a corner,\u201d Mr. Katainen said in a statement. \u201cEurope will continue to assist Greece in whatever way is necessary to ensure reasonable financing conditions for the Greek state and to smooth the path back to full and sustainable market access.\u201dThe latest troubles come as Prime Minister Antonis Samaras seeks to lead Greece out of its 240 billion euro, or $305 billion, bailout program and shed the oversight of the country\u2019s so-called troika of lenders \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 by the end of this year. That would be much earlier than planned, and it is meant to appease austerity-weary voters and lawmakers before a crucial election in February.Parts of Greece\u2019s economy appear to be recovering from a wrenching five-year recession, but investors are concerned the government will be unable to continue raising funds in the financial markets. While the part of the bailout funded by the European Commission and the E.C.B. is closing this year, the I.M.F.'s portion is scheduled to run for at least another year. The I.M.F. warned recently that Greece may run out of funding without it.On Thursday, a senior official at the Greek Ministry of Finance, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the government had not decided on any change of direction and that any decisions would be made \u201cin collaboration with our partners.\u201dMr. Katainen\u2019s statement, though, suggested the commission would like to see Greece stick with its previously planned bailout timetable and be prepared to accept further assistance and monitoring as needed.\u201cWe will work to ensure a smooth evolution of European support for the country after the end of the current program,\u201d he said.Mr. Samaras\u2019s coalition government looks shaky despite winning a confidence vote in Parliament last week. He needs to muster a three-fifths majority in Parliament in February to elect a replacement for President Karolos Papoulias, whose term expires in March. If that effort fails, early general elections will be called.Opinion polls suggest that the leftist opposition party, Syriza \u2014 which has pledged to reverse reforms and write off a chunk of Greece\u2019s debts \u2014 has a strong chance of gaining power.Changing the government before Mr. Samaras\u2019s four-year term expires in 2016 could stoke fresh political instability in Greece, where he has overseen a steady but painful economic recovery since being elected in 2012.In April, Mr. Samaras returned Greece to the bond markets after four long years, buoyed by optimism of a broader eurozone recovery. Mr. Samaras was inspired by Ireland, which last year became the first crisis-hit eurozone country to exit an international bailout early.Investors were happy to snap up Greece\u2019s new debt issuance, which at the time was yielding far richer returns than the debt of safe-haven countries: more than 4 percent, compared with just around 2 percent for United States Treasuries.But even back in the spring the higher yield reflected the recognition that Greece was still a relatively high-risk investment \u2014 a fact that became more apparent this week amid the upheaval in global financial markets.To be sure, there still are signs the Greek economy is slowly turning around. Tourism has rebounded to record levels, with 20 million visitors so far this year, up from 18 million last year. Greece has also managed to get a primary surplus \u2014 a budget surplus not counting interest payments on debt \u2014 and Mr. Samaras still predicts growth of more than 2 percent next year.On the streets of Athens, too, Greeks say there is a palpable sense that things are better than even a year ago. Shopping and tourism districts near the Acropolis bustle with crowds. On a recent weekend night, bars and cafes around Syntagma Square at the center of the city were packed.But numerous problems remain. Foremost are the mounting debts of Greece\u2019s biggest banks \u2014 the lenders raised new capital last year but are seeing bad loans surge as households and businesses fall further behind.The Fitch Ratings agency warned on Wednesday that large amounts of problem loans had made the balance sheets of Greece\u2019s four biggest banks \u201cvulnerable to developments in an improving but still very weak economy.\u201dThe lingering social costs of the troika-imposed austerity program in Greece are also enormous.Although some new jobs are being created, unemployment is at 26.4 percent, down only slightly from a 28 percent peak last year, and youth joblessness is at 51.5 percent.Those statistics are a reason Mr. Samaras has been eager to show Greeks there is hope ahead. But his reassurances might be lost on many voters, Mr. Rahman said.\u201cWhether Greece is running a primary surplus or not, whether Greek banks will fare well, whether the quarterly growth numbers turn positive \u2014 these are academic factors that do not resonate with the broader public,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cWhile the government has done a lot to put Greece on the road to stability, that hasn\u2019t translated into a positive sentiment for the average voter.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Smelling Liberal, Thinking Conservative", "Date": "2014-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI JUST learned that I suffer from cognitive-olfactory dissonance. I don\u2019t smell the way I think.The researchers found evidence that people are instinctively attracted to the smell emitted by those with similar ideologies. In one memorable instance, a female participant asked the scholars if she could take one of the samples home, describing it as \u201cthe best perfume I ever smelled.\u201d The scent came from a man who shared her political views. Just before, a different woman with the opposite views had smelled the exact same sample, declared it \u201crancid,\u201d and urged the researchers to throw it out. Ideological like-mindedness exerts a biological pull on our attraction, it seems \u2014 and deep disagreements can really stink. These results suggest that our beliefs have a strong biological component. But what if our beliefs conflict with our aromatic state of nature? This is not a trivial question in my household. Based on my youth and the beliefs I was instinctively drawn to, I have to assume my own natural scent is Conventional Seattle Progressive. That of my wife, Ester, is the irresistible fragrance Barcelona Hard Left. This must have made for a good combination, because we spoke no language in common when we met, achieving real communication fluency only after the first few years of marriage. Scoff if you will, but 23 years and counting smells pretty sweet to me.There was little political dialogue in our early years, but our progressive views were unquestioned and predictable, growing up as we did. This is not too surprising, as social scientists consistently find that parents\u2019 political attitudes have a huge influence on their children\u2019s opinions. And this is not merely a result of one\u2019s upbringing. Research that looks at identical twins consistently finds that genetics plays a large role in forming our worldviews.But for Ester and me, odor wasn\u2019t destiny. When we finally were able to move from smelling to talking, we built a mutual interest in politics and policy, and set out on a quest together to figure out what we believed. This involved a lot of reading and study, and intimate dinner conversation themes ranging from the fairness of capitalism to the nature of God. Fun couple!After a few years, we were shocked to discover that our minds no longer matched our old instincts \u2014 or, apparently, our noses. We chose new views on a host of issues from the economy to national security. We ended up as enthusiasts for the free enterprise system, and believers in the notion that America is fundamentally a force for good in the world. These were manifestly not the views we had held all our lives. On economic issues, a little knowledge of supply and demand can go a long way. But our beliefs have deeper foundations that are more subjective and personal \u2014 even primal. Indeed, scholars find that some of the most elemental differences between liberals and conservatives occur on the moral plane. In his now famous research, New York University\u2019s Jonathan Haidt interviewed hundreds of people and surveyed tens of thousands more about their moral biases. He told outlandish stories (one involved a family eating its dog) and gauged his subjects\u2019 immediate moral reactions. The differences were stark.Basically, Dr. Haidt found that conservatives are from Mars and liberals are from Venus. For example, while conservatives generally have a strong instinct for respecting authority, most liberals simply do not \u2014 and they find the conservative view utterly baffling. This difference lurks behind many controversies. For example, it helps explain why so many conservatives see flag-burning as profoundly outrageous, while many liberals see it as, at worst, inadvisable.True to our roots, Ester and I are natural authority resisters. We find ourselves innately on the liberal end of Professor Haidt\u2019s moral compass. But does that necessarily mean we must be political progressives? Of course not. How you feel viscerally may be highly correlated with where you start out ideologically. But in a bespoke life, your philosophy should be your creation. Venus may be where you were born, but you are free to be an ideological immigrant and move to Mars if you please.The technical name for this phenomenon is \u201cthinking for yourself.\u201d Of course, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean starting out on the left and moving to the right. Many people have done the opposite. Others have made a thorough and honest examination of their inherent beliefs and wound up back where they started. Congratulations, fellow freethinkers!But beware the great swindle of modern life. Too often, the media and academia assiduously stamp out ideas that are pronounced anathema according to prevailing fashion. Go against the preponderant views of your demographic group? Get ready to be dismissed as a sellout, or \u201cself-loathing,\u201d or worse.This is the intellectual equivalent of closing the borders. And like closing actual borders, it is both unfair and unwise. We owe our moral worth to people who escaped the iron cage of their culture to rebel against such evils as slavery and racism. We owe our prosperity to crazed entrepreneurs who had no patience for what everyone else knew to be right. We need ideological immigrants who infiltrate our society with new and subversive ideas. As Ester \u2014 an American by choice \u2014 reminds me, that is our nation\u2019s unique strength.Our instincts and preconceptions are where our thinking begins. They shouldn\u2019t be where it stops. Our noses may lead us to true love. But only our brains and our will can lead us to true freedom. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A County Resents Oil Drilling, Despite the Money It Brings In", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneGARDEN CITY, Tex. \u2014 Dennis Seidenberger has farmed cotton for 49 years in this close-knit community 40 miles southeast of Midland. Farming is a way of life that he passed on to his son, and one that he hopes will stay in the family for generations.But his outlook has changed over the past three years as a surge in oil drilling has transformed Glasscock County, where he lives. \u201cThey\u2019ve totally ruined our way of life here,\u201d Mr. Seidenberger said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get over it.\u201dHis sentiments sum up how many residents throughout the county view the drilling boom, despite the boost it has given to both the local economy and the county\u2019s coffers. \u201cIf something happened and oil went to $50 a barrel and everything moved out of here tomorrow, I don\u2019t think it would hurt anybody\u2019s feelings in Glasscock County,\u201d said the county judge, Kim Halfmann.One fact is crucial in understanding the anger toward the drilling that is pervasive among Glasscock County\u2019s 1,251 residents: Most cotton farmers here do not own the mineral rights for the land that they farm. Under Texas law, the rights of mineral owners trump the rights of surface owners, meaning most Glasscock County farmers are powerless to stop energy developers from drilling wells, even as it destroys valuable crop land.\u201cI guess that\u2019s what really irritates some of my producers: They\u2019ve farmed this land for so many years, and basically someone shows up and says what they\u2019re going to do with it,\u201d said Jeff Turner, chief executive of the Glasscock County Co-Op Gin, a local farming cooperative.Most landowners sold their mineral rights decades ago to raise money during lean years of farming, Mr. Turner said. At the time, few foresaw the frenzy of drilling activity that was to come.\u201cA lot of them sold those mineral rights to survive and to eat and to keep their land,\u201d Mr. Turner said.Between one-third and two-thirds of Texas farmers do not own the mineral rights under the land they farm, according to Darren Hudson, an agricultural economist at Texas Tech University.\u201cI know some farmers who have gotten filthy rich off the boom, but most of them don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Hudson said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t own the mineral rights, it\u2019s more of an inconvenience.\u201dDebbra Mamula, executive vice president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association, said the energy development in Glasscock County has produced tangible benefits, most noticeably, oil and gas operators pay the bulk of property taxes. Judge Halfmann agreed that the drilling boom has been great for her county\u2019s revenue, but said most of that additional money is being used to repair roads damaged by oil field truck activity. Overall, the gains from drilling are not viewed as worth the drawbacks in a county long dominated by cotton farming. For every new oil or gas well, drilling firms take over a pad site of three to five acres and construct pathways \u2014 often through cropland \u2014 to a nearby road. All of that land will probably never be suitable for fertile farming again, said Norman Garza, associate legislative director with the Texas Farm Bureau. (The Texas Farm Bureau is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)Drilling companies often pay landowners to cover \u201cdamages\u201d for a well. Several cotton farmers told The Tribune that a typical payment for a well site was about $10,000, an amount they were told was nonnegotiable, as state law did not require any payment to the surface owner.\u201cYou\u2019re kind of at the mercy of what they want to pay,\u201d said Dennis Fuchs, a cotton farmer whose 640-acre piece of farmland has 16 wells. He echoed several other farmers in describing the payments as insufficient to cover the loss of farmland and the hassle of maneuvering plows and other farming equipment around the well sites.\u201cIf you have the minerals on it, then yeah, the damages are fine,\u201d said Ronnie Hirt, one of the few Glasscock County cotton farmers who co-owns mineral rights on most of his farmland. \u201cIf the only income you get is the damages, they\u2019re not nearly enough.\u201dBill Mintz, a spokesman for Apache, one of Glasscock County\u2019s most active drillers, said the company tries to treat farmers fairly, regardless of whether they own the mineral rights.\u201cSurface damage payments are the result of a commercial negotiation between the company and surface owner,\u201d Mr. Mintz said. \u201cWe believe our offers are fair, in the context that we also need to be consistent across the area.\u201d (Apache has been a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.)The drilling activity has impacted the work and lifestyles of Glasscock County cotton farmers in several other ways.The proliferation of trash from oil field workers is a particular source of frustration. Farmers spoke of empty plastic bottles, food wrappers and coat hangers piling up on well sites and scattering across their farmland, sometimes ending up mixed into cotton bales sold to mills.\u201cThis community used to be pristine,\u201d Mr. Fuchs said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much trash I have picked up \u2014 like 30-gallon garbage cans of it.\u201dThe drilling activity has also extended the time it takes to accomplish basic farming tasks like scheduling a visit from a crop-dusting plane. Because the chemicals used can be hazardous, farmers spoke of having to arrange with multiple energy firms to ensure no oil field workers are on the premises at the time.\u201cI deal with five oil companies on a daily basis,\u201d Mr. Seidenberger said.The influx of thousands of oil workers, many of whom stay in temporary housing facilities, has also been a sore point, particularly as it has contributed to a spike in traffic crashes.\u201cMy accident rate has gone up fivefold since I took office five years ago,\u201d Judge Halfmann said. Many farmers are selling groundwater to drillers. While the additional revenue eases some of the complaints about the drilling, some farmers fear they are contributing to the community\u2019s permanent undoing. \u201cIf my water well goes dry, my house is worth nothing, and that\u2019s a really big concern,\u201d Mr. Hirt said.Despite that concern, Mr. Hirt is still selling his water to drillers because he knows landowners living near him are doing the same from an aquifer they share.\u201cIt\u2019s still going to be depleted,\u201d Mr. Hirt said. \u201cIt makes you feel like, well, you better get your part of it, or someone else will.\u201dIt is a bitter pill for Judge Halfmann, who regularly hears of the concerns from farmers. \u201cCounty governments, we don\u2019t have jurisdiction over any of the things that are going on,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me feel like I\u2019m not serving my constituency the way that I wish that I could, but my hands are tied.\u201dabatheja@texastribune.org SHALE BOOM View more stories about how the drilling boom is changing lives and fortunes across Texas. www.trib.it/shale-lifeAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bolivia\u2019s Fire-Proof President", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBUENOS AIRES \u2014 On Sunday, Bolivians are widely expected to re-elect their president, Evo Morales, for an unprecedented third term. He is still overwhelmingly popular, including among the indigenous people from whom he has sprung. Their conditions of life have improved dramatically since he first took office in 2006, and so has the general economy. But that extraordinary popularity could ultimately prove a weakness for Bolivia, since he has so far shown no inclination to groom a successor and a strong political party to assure that his transformation of Bolivia does not fade when he inevitably leaves office.For certain, Bolivia has shown the world an assertive, if sometimes startling, national image of late. Thanks to loans from China, the Internet reaches rural schools via a satellite that bears the name of Tupac Katari, the leader of an important indigenous uprising against Spanish colonial rule. Like Mr. Morales, Bolivia\u2019s current foreign minister, David Choquehuanca, belongs to the Aymara, one of the 36 ethnic groups recognized by Bolivia. Following a visit to London, he proposed to change the hands of the clock at the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, the Bolivian equivalent of Congress, so that they move counterclockwise \u2014 symbol of Bolivia\u2019s recent spirit of change and independence in the Southern Hemisphere. Another example: the government maintains a vehemently anti-American discourse even as it promises Bolivian students scholarships to study at Harvard and Stanford.What seems clear is that Bolivia is defying longstanding caricatures of itself as an icon of political instability. Economic stability has followed the political achievement, and opinion polls have given the president a 40 percent advantage over his closest rival. If he wins, it will give him a third term \u2014 a possibility based on a constitutional change that he initiated but that his detractors say he is misusing. Even so, his popularity endures. Under his Movement Toward Socialism, poverty dropped to 45 percent in 2011. In 2005, it had been 64 percent. Mr. Morales is also the first indigenous president of Bolivia, where 48 percent of the population declared themselves indigenous in the last census, and his government has proven itself adept at reconciling ancestral knowledge with economic modernization.All of this has left Bolivia in the grip of the leftist or populist trend in South American politics that was rising at the turn of the 21st century, even though that trend has slowed in Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. In the United States, business and foreign policy figures have long portrayed Mr. Morales as an authoritarian strongman who connects emotionally to the masses and was bankrolled by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the populist leader and ally of Cuba who governed Venezuela from 1999 until his death last year. But the notion of a mentor/student relationship underestimates Mr. Morales and overestimates Mr. Ch\u00e1vez. With Mr. Ch\u00e1vez gone, there is little Venezuelan aid to speak of today. But Bolivia is expected to finish the year with the highest growth rate in South America \u2014 above 5 percent. During his time in office, per capita income has grown from $1,000 to $2,550 and unemployment levels have remained below double digits. Between 2006 and 2014, $8 billion of oil income was disbursed to social programs for young people, the elderly and young mothers. Mr. Morales\u2019s most emphatic opponents accuse him of being authoritarian, uneducated and intransigent, but don\u2019t challenge his personal integrity. In Bolivia, presidents govern from the Palacio Quemado (the Burnt Palace), a name earned in 1875 when it was set on fire with torches. It hints at Bolivia\u2019s well-earned identity as a flammable country: of 83 governments, 36 lasted a year or less and 37 were anti-democratic. If he is re-elected and serves out his term, Mr. Morales will have achieved the longest staying power of any president: 14 years. During his first term, the resource-rich east seemed on the verge of secession, but he managed to dismantle the regional opposition. Since then, domestic political opposition has been erratic. For this election, most of the other contenders are simply framing themselves as better administrators of the existing system. Nationalizations, most importantly of the hydrocarbon industry, have been the pillars supporting this agenda. Another point in the government\u2019s favor was the country\u2019s new constitution, which improved representation in a country long characterized by crippling social exclusion. Not long ago, in La Paz, I asked a street soup vendor\u2019s 11- year-old son what he wanted to be when he grew up. \u201cPresident,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident like Evo.\u201d That the son of a mujer de pollera, an urban indigenous woman, can see himself as president illustrates the seismic change in Bolivia. Relations with the United States are touchy at best, principally over coca production. President Obama has again declared that Bolivia \u201cfailed demonstrably\u201d in its counternarcotics efforts, which meant the United States would continue to withhold aid. But the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has praised the Bolivian government\u2019s efforts to tackle coca production, so the American move may only have isolated the United States in the region. The plant\u2019s leaves, chewed for extra energy at Andean altitudes, are deep in Bolivian tradition, and Mr. Morales himself once led the coca growers union. So framing relations within the context of the fight against drugs is a perspective that has severe limitations in Bolivia. If Mr. Morales wins the election, he must now look forward, and use his third term to create the necessary conditions for a plausible successor. That the political process is so strongly identified with him has only contributed to the lack of potential successors. No important leaders have emerged; President Morales\u2019s ruling party has not grown stronger; and up to now, he has not considered stepping down. On the contrary, he has increasingly concentrated his power and made decisions on his own. The problem of this strong personal identification with the presidency will only grow more acute if his legislators press to modify the constitution in order to guarantee Mr. Morales\u2019s unlimited re-election (all he needs is two-thirds of the vote on Sunday). Any eternalization will ultimately be a blow to the economic boom and the social progress achieved. The new Bolivia should not allow a president\u2019s cold to escalate into a raging disease.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo, With Biden, Announces Contests to Upgrade Airports in New York City", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo appeared near La Guardia Airport on Monday to announce that one of his next big ideas was to fix New York City\u2019s airports, his co-pilot was none other than La Guardia\u2019s chief critic, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Mr. Cuomo said he would open competitions for the best designs for the airports, seeking master plans for making them more attractive and efficient. At La Guardia, he said those plans could include linking the airport to Manhattan with ferries and a spur of the Long Island Rail Road. At Kennedy, he indicated, they could include a hotel and better access to existing transit lines. He said the state would also try to make better use of Republic Airport on Long Island and Stewart Airport in the Hudson Valley.To Mr. Biden, a fellow Democrat, the governor said, \u201cWe\u2019ve heard your message and we\u2019re acting on it.\u201dBut some of the most vocal critics of the conditions at the city\u2019s airports had a different message for Mr. Cuomo: What took you so long?Joseph Sitt, a developer who is chairman of Global Gateway Alliance, a group that has called for years for improvements to the airports, said he appreciated the governor\u2019s declarations but questioned whether they were mere election-year \u201chyperbole.\u201d He said that a couple of years ago, \u201cthe governor was practically laughing at\u201d his group\u2019s demands and its negative comparisons to airports in places like Dubai and Istanbul.Mr. Sitt said he had hoped to hear a financial commitment and a schedule for getting the work done because \u201cwithout dollars and cents, it could just be government rhetoric.\u201d He also expressed concern that the governor\u2019s call for ideas would delay the impending decision by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on a winning bid for the construction of a new main terminal at La Guardia. In response, Mr. Cuomo said in a phone interview that no financing had been lined up yet because the designs had to come first. But he said it would be shortsighted to solicit ideas without the confidence they could be executed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to finance the reconstruction,\u201d he said.The Port Authority, which operates La Guardia and Kennedy, has chosen three consortiums as finalists to build the new terminal, which it estimates will cost $3.6 billion. The authority\u2019s commissioners have not said when they will announce a decision, but the matter is not on the agenda for their monthly meeting on Wednesday.A spokesman for the Port Authority declined to comment, saying it would defer to the governor\u2019s statements.He said he intended for that selection process and the design competitions to occur simultaneously, suggesting that a new main terminal would have to be built in any case. Still, he acknowledged that the best idea to come out of the open competition might involve changes to the proposal chosen by the Port Authority.\u201cIf someone has an idea to do it, modifying the building, fine,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.Mr. Cuomo and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, jointly control the Port Authority. But Mr. Cuomo said that in a conversation last year, he and Mr. Christie agreed that each would take responsibility for the Port Authority\u2019s assets in his own state. \u201cI said I thought the Port Authority was not moving quickly enough\u201d to improve the airports in New York, Mr. Cuomo recounted.The governor made it clear that he was in a hurry to gather design ideas for La Guardia and Kennedy, saying the competition would start in 30 days. Two months later, three finalists for each airport would be awarded as much as $500,000 to develop their plans further, he said.That money was the only financial commitment in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s announcement, though both he and Mr. Biden emphasized how important the airports are to the regional economy. The vice president was there to offer moral support, not a monetary pledge from the federal government.\u201cMoney doesn\u2019t grow on trees, but I\u2019ll tell you, one way to grow the money is to build the infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Biden said.He lavished praise on Mr. Cuomo, who is up for re-election next month, saying, \u201cGovernor, your ideas are as big and as bold as you are.\u201dSpeaking of big and bold, Mr. Biden, who rambled on for 25 minutes about the importance of rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure, even compared Mr. Cuomo to Abraham Lincoln. \u201cHe\u2019s like you, pal. He had vision.\u201dAsked afterward if he thought the comparison hinted that Mr. Biden thought the governor had prospects as a presidential candidate, Mr. Cuomo said, \u201cI thought he was saying that I looked very old.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indonesian Leader in Global Spotlight", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal TrendsJAKARTA \u2014 In his previous life as a small-time furniture exporter and exhibitor, Joko Widodo was used to erecting stages. But in early November, just days after being sworn in as the president of Indonesia, he will now be sharing a stage with the world\u2019s most powerful leaders.Between Nov. 10 and Nov. 16, Mr. Joko will, in succession, attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit meeting in Beijing; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) leaders\u2019 meeting and the East Asia Summit, both being held in Naypyidaw, Myanmar; and a meeting of G-20 leaders in Brisbane, Australia.Mr. Joko, who was sworn in as president on Monday, comes into office with no foreign policy experience, and his introduction into international affairs will be, according to analysts, a trial by fire. \u201cThe most important thing is meeting these leaders face to face,\u201d Mr. Joko said in an interview shortly before his inauguration, \u201cand develop those relationships.\u201dThat may be easier said than done, given that he doesn\u2019t have much in common with his counterparts. Born in a slum in the province of Central Java, Mr. Joko, 53, a former carpenter, is the first Indonesian president not to come from the country\u2019s political elite or be an army general.He is expected to have bilateral meetings during the conferences with, among others, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who is a former K.G.B. officer, and Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the prime minister of Thailand, who carried out a military coup there last May. The biggest thing Mr. Joko has in common with President Barack Obama, whom his aides said he is scheduled to meet one-on-one in Beijing, is that they both have lived in Indonesia.Tall, thin and unassuming, Mr. Joko himself has joked that his face looks more like that of a village street-food vendor than of a head of state. But behind it lies a sharp intellect and kinetic energy to get things done.As governor of Jakarta, he was mobbed by well-wishers during his daily walking tours through traditional markets and slum areas, where he would talk about bread-and-butter issues such as health care, education and traffic.Mr. Joko\u2019s unusual style and equally unusual nickname (\u201cJokowi\u201d), coupled with his unlikely ascension to the Indonesian presidency, garnered heavy international media attention and piqued the interest of foreign leaders.\u201cIt will be interesting to see Jokowi\u2019s personal chemistry with Obama and other leaders, and how he performs,\u201d said Matthew P. Goodman, senior adviser for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who served as the Obama administration\u2019s White House coordinator for APEC and the East Asia Summit in 2011. \u201cOther leaders will be looking at how he performs, with a neutral eye,\u201d he said.Mr. Joko came into office with pressing domestic concerns, in particular a hostile group of opposition parties in Indonesia\u2019s House of Representatives that are controlled by Prabowo Subianto, a former army general who lost to him in the country\u2019s July 9 presidential election.\u201cHe would have come to these meetings as a star, but he\u2019s domestically distracted,\u201d said Kishore Mahbubani, a former Singaporean diplomat and the current dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\u201cWhat it does is affect the attention you pay to events, and whether you have a free hand to launch initiatives,\u201d Mr. Mahbubani said, adding that Mr. Joko should remain low-key at the summits and treat them as a learning experience.Others are looking for Mr. Joko to immediately play a visible role on the international stage, given that Indonesia is the world\u2019s fourth-most populous country, its largest Muslim-majority state and a G-20 member. It also lies astride the world\u2019s busiest shipping lane in the Strait of Malacca.Indonesia also has domestic problems with a global impact, including climate change due to deforestation, terrorism and human trafficking.\u201cHe has an opportunity to shine,\u201d said Alexander Feldman, president and chief executive of the U.S.-Asean Business Council. \u201cThe world is curious about Jokowi and what he is going to focus on. And I think that world leaders want to court him.\u201dSince its independence from Dutch colonial rule in the 1940s, Indonesia has maintained a feel-good foreign policy that Mr. Joko\u2019s predecessor, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, described as \u201ca million friends and zero enemies.\u201dThe country\u2019s transition to democracy, which began in 1999, and its growing economic importance have placed it in the same conversation as Asia\u2019s two largest emerging economies: China and India. Mr. Yudhoyono worked to further project both Indonesia\u2019s and his own influence on the global stage, with issues such as climate change and Islamic extremism, with mostly indifferent results.\u201cIndonesia at one point tried to mediate on the Korean Peninsula, and that didn\u2019t work out very well,\u201d said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.Analysts and Mr. Joko\u2019s advisers said he would be less ambitious and instead try to project Indonesia\u2019s influence through Asean, its traditional foreign policy base. \u201cIndonesia is best described as a regional power with global concerns \u2014 it\u2019s not China or India,\u201d said Amitav Acharya, a professor at American University in Washington and author of \u201cIndonesia Matters: Asia\u2019s Emerging Democratic Power.\u201d\u201cBut by playing the role of a regional mediator and helping to keep Asean together, Indonesia helps to contribute to stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world,\u201d he said, \u201csince it is in the Asia-Pacific that we have all the major powers \u2014 the U.S., China, Japan and India \u2014 whose relationships will be key to global stability.\u201dRizal Sukma, an adviser to Mr. Joko, said the president\u2019s foreign policy would be directed more by business and economic concerns than geopolitical ones. Mr. Rizal said Indonesia\u2019s geographical location gives it the ability, as an archipelago state, to practice \u201cmaritime diplomacy.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t eat an international image,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key focus is to use diplomacy for economic benefit. We have a strategic partnership with India, but the relationship has not reached half its potential.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Reach China, LinkedIn Plays by Local Rules", "Date": "2014-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 For American technology companies from Microsoft to Facebook to Google, China is a difficult, even impossible, place to operate. But one company, the social network LinkedIn, has found a way to do business \u2014 by being willing to compromise on the free expression that is the backbone of life on the Western Internet.LinkedIn\u2019s experience provides a blueprint, and perhaps a cautionary lesson, for Silicon Valley as it tries to crack the vast Chinese market. Other American tech companies are watching with great interest, wondering whether LinkedIn will find an equilibrium between free speech and Chinese law that it can live with.\u201cOver the next five years, things will continue to progress in a positive fashion over there, so it\u2019s important to be there today,\u201d said Kerry Rice, an Internet analyst at Needham, a brokerage firm. \u201cIf LinkedIn figures out how to navigate the operating environment in China, clearly other companies will try to imitate that.\u201dLinkedIn\u2019s global English-language site has attracted four million Chinese members without gaining much attention from the Chinese government. But the company wanted to reach more of China\u2019s estimated 140 million professional workers, and so in February it introduced a Chinese-language version.The Chinese-language site has attracted about a million new members and seems to have the tacit approval of the government. It is functioning without blockages even though the authorities have cracked down on other Internet services, including Instagram and Yahoo, in reaction to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.The secret to LinkedIn\u2019s seeming success? Aside from its willingness to play by Chinese rules on expression, the company has relinquished 7 percent of its local operation to two well-connected Chinese venture capital firms. Having such a relationship with homegrown firms is crucial for foreign web companies seeking to operate in China, experts say.\u201cThe government needs to know who they can call, and as a foreign company you need to know before your site gets shut down so you have a chance to do something about it,\u201d said Duncan Clark, founder of BDA China, a consulting firm that advises foreign companies on China\u2019s tech sector. \u201cThat\u2019s worth a lot, to have that channel.\u201dA spokesman for LinkedIn, Hani Durzy, said the company opened a Chinese-language site because of its \u201cbelief that the creation of economic opportunity can have a profound impact on the lives of Chinese individuals, much as it has elsewhere in the world.\u201d\u201cWhile we strongly support freedom of expression,\u201d he added, \u201cwe recognized when we launched that we would need to adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate in China. So the decision to proceed in China was one that we weighed heavily.\u201dOn the Chinese- and English-language sites in China, the company censors content that the authorities consider politically sensitive, using a combination of software algorithms and human reviewers. People whose posts are blocked get an emailed form letter advising them that a posted item contains \u201ccontent prohibited in China\u201d and \u201cwill not be seen by LinkedIn members located in China.\u201dLinkedIn also does not provide Chinese-language users certain important tools \u2014 like the ability to create or join groups or to post long essays \u2014 that allow people elsewhere to have public discussions and form communities.Although LinkedIn\u2019s strategy has given it access to Chinese speakers, analysts say it poses risks for the company\u2019s reputation and growth strategy.Like many American tech companies, LinkedIn, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., has promoted itself as dedicated to free-market principles. Too much censorship could cause users to flee.What\u2019s more, if LinkedIn\u2019s business grows larger in China, that could give the government more leverage to make demands about what type of content is permissible globally.The company has already stumbled a bit in its entry into the Chinese market. It angered some non-Chinese customers, who found that posts they made in English while in China were blocked globally as part of the company\u2019s effort to protect its Chinese users from anything that could attract unwanted government scrutiny. LinkedIn moved to loosen its policy last month, allowing posts blocked in China to be seen elsewhere.Some also say LinkedIn has not communicated clearly how and why it is censoring content.For example, Bill Bishop, a media commentator and tech investor in China, said content he posted about China from a connection in the United States was blocked by the service. When he inquired why, the company inaccurately responded that it was because he had posted the item from China, when the real problem was that he had listed China as his work location.Other tech companies have weighed the risks of trying to satisfy the Chinese government and taken a different approach.Twitter has been blocked in China for years and says it will not censor posts because to do so would \u201csacrifice the principles of the platform,\u201d according to Colin Crowell, the company\u2019s vice president for global public policy.Vine, a short-video service owned by Twitter, operates freely in China without \u201cany special arrangement,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.Although Facebook \u2014 the world\u2019s largest social network, with about 1.3 billion monthly users worldwide \u2014 is blocked in China, it hasn\u2019t given up on getting in the country. But it is trying to use commerce to pry open the door, selling ads to Chinese companies and government organizations that want to reach consumers outside China. \u201cWe think this is an exciting opportunity,\u201d Dan Neary, the company\u2019s vice president for Asia and the Pacific, said in a statement.Analysts say LinkedIn is well positioned to be acceptable to Beijing because it can argue that it makes the employment market more efficient, ultimately spurring the economy. China\u2019s Internet regulators often argue that the main goal of development of the Internet should be to bolster economic growth.China\u2019s closed markets have given a huge head start to four homegrown companies, which dominate the Internet there: Alibaba in e-commerce, Baidu in search, Tencent in video gaming and instant messaging and Sina in social networking.LinkedIn itself faces competition from local rivals like Zhaopin and 51Jobs.com, which both have more users than it does in China.LinkedIn\u2019s partnership with two local players \u2014 China Broadband Capital and a Chinese affiliate of Sequoia Capital, an American venture capital firm \u2014 has helped it manage its relationship with government officials.C.B.C. was founded by Edward Tian, a well-connected investor and former entrepreneur who once ran a telecommunications company with the son of a former Chinese president, Jiang Zemin. The company has helped bring at least one other Silicon Valley company, Evernote, into China.\u201cThere have been a lot of problems with companies like Facebook and Twitter,\u201d said Kevin Wang, a C.B.C. spokesman. \u201cWe think one of the key reasons is the lack of communication, even the absence of communication, between these companies and the Chinese government.\u201dThe local partners have a strong incentive to help LinkedIn succeed. Under the partnership agreement, they can buy an additional 21 percent of the joint venture for $20 million if certain conditions are met.LinkedIn does retain control of the venture, securing the bulk of the profit as well as the risk.Under Chinese law, the joint venture will eventually need to obtain an Internet content provider\u2019s license to keep operating. The license has some benefits, but also some downsides; once granted, the company will be required to store information about its Chinese users in China.Doing so would make it much easier for the government to demand information on, say, dissidents who use the service \u2014 a conundrum that tripped up Yahoo nearly a decade ago and prompted that company to essentially pull out of the country.Despite the challenges, LinkedIn is optimistic about its efforts in China.\u201cIn the end, the most important consideration for us was providing an opportunity for millions of Chinese professionals to significantly expand their economic opportunities,\u201d said Mr. Durzy, the LinkedIn spokesman. \u201cWe want to get it right in China, so we will continue to listen and learn.\"Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Order vs. Disorder, Part 4", "Date": "2014-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019ve been arguing for a while now that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is to the wider East-West clash of civilizations what Off Broadway is to Broadway. It\u2019s where you can see many trends at a smaller scale first. That is why I study it closely. Whether it is airline-hijacking, suicide-bombing or trying to do nation-building with the other \u2014 Israelis called it \u201cLebanon invasion\u201d and \u201cOslo\u201d; we called it \u201cIraq\u201d and \u201cAfghanistan\u201d \u2014 what happens there often moves to the larger stage. So, as I have asked before: What\u2019s playing Off Broadway now?It\u2019s a play called \u201cContainment.\u201d When faced with\u00a0a barrage of rockets from the Hamas militants in Gaza, Israel largely retaliated with artillery and air power. These inflicted enough pain on Hamas and the Gaza civilian population that Hamas eventually agreed to a cease-fire \u2014 but not to surrender.Indeed, Israel chose to deliberately leave Hamas in power in Gaza because it did not want to put Israeli boots on the ground and try to destroy it \u2014 which would have required bloody house-to-house fighting \u2014 and because Israel also did not want to leave Gaza as an ungoverned space. Israel\u2019s adopting a strategy of containment toward Gaza also became viable\u00a0after Egypt\u2019s top military commander, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, replaced the Muslim Brotherhood government led by Mohamed Morsi. The Brotherhood saw Hamas as an ally and allowed it to dig tunnels into Egypt and smuggle in goods for profit and rockets to hit Israel. Sisi, who sees the Brotherhood as his archenemy, has closed those tunnels. So containment, as a purely military strategy to stem disorder, can work for Israel, for now. Containment also seems to be where the U.S.-led coalition is heading, for now, against the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS. Since neither we nor our coalition partners are willing \u2014 or, thus far, in the case of the Iraqi Army and Syrian \u201cmoderates,\u201d able \u2014 to put many boots on the ground to oust ISIS, we will rely on air power to prevent ISIS from expanding and maybe to shrink it.But here we come to the most important difference between the containment we used to defeat the Soviet Union and the containment of Hamas and ISIS. We and the Israelis are both using containment to seal off a problem that we each perceive as too costly, politically and in human terms, to try to eliminate. But that strategy has its limits.As Mark Mykleby, a retired Marine colonel and the co-director of\u00a0the Strategic Innovation Lab at Case Western Reserve University, put it to me: \u201cIn the Cold War, we contained the Soviets militarily to set the conditions for the U.S.S.R. to collapse on itself, but that wasn\u2019t the whole story. We also rebuilt the shattered economies of our former enemies, built international institutions like the I.M.F. and World Bank, and redesigned our own governing institutions to address our new post-World War II reality so that we would have the strategic scaffolding in place to continue building a post-Cold War world once the Soviet Union did in fact collapse.\u201cIn the case of Gaza,\u201d he added, \u201cthe Israelis are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of a chronic problem by simply \u2018containing\u2019 the Palestinians.\u201d Without a strategy for improving living conditions there, that could prove very damaging to Israel in the long run as Gaza becomes a human disaster zone. The West is doing something similar with ISIS: containing without building \u201cthe regional scaffolding to support and leverage\u201d a more modern, consensual and pluralistic Middle East that might fill the ISIS space.Containment, said Mykleby, only makes long-term sense if you commit money and political capital to fill that space with something decent. Israel is not doing that because Hamas refuses to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and be a partner to a two-state solution. And because right-wing Jewish settlers so dominate Israel\u2019s ruling coalition that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu cannot or will not put on the table anything close to what the more moderate Palestinian Authority demands for a two-state deal. Nor is it clear the Palestinians could deliver the security Israel demands. In short, the whole relationship is broken, making a strategy beyond containment very hard. On Broadway, we\u2019re hamstrung in building a post-ISIS political strategy by the fact that some of our coalition partners have no shared vision for a post-ISIS Syria or Iraq and do not want democracy in this region. Also, some of them, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are purveyors of the intolerant, anti-pluralistic Sunni ideology that inspires ISIS fighters. Even Turkey\u2019s Islamist government has some pro-ISIS sympathies.In short, containment in both theaters is necessary but not sufficient for long-term stability. But, unlike the Cold War where our containment strategy was largely the product of like-minded democracies working to liberate like-minded people from a bad system, in the Middle East, we have few like-minded partners. The most we can hope for are \u201cleast bad\u201d allies and \u201cleast bad\u201d outcomes. In today\u2019s Middle East, least bad is the new good. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Plutocrats Against Democracy", "Date": "2014-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s always good when leaders tell the truth, especially if that wasn\u2019t their intention. So we should be grateful to Leung Chun-ying, the Beijing-backed leader of Hong Kong, for blurting out the real reason pro-democracy demonstrators can\u2019t get what they want: With open voting, \u201cYou would be talking to half of the people in Hong Kong who earn less than $1,800 a month. Then you would end up with that kind of politics and policies\u201d \u2014 policies, presumably, that would make the rich less rich and provide more aid to those with lower incomes.So Mr. Leung is worried about the 50 percent of Hong Kong\u2019s population that, he believes, would vote for bad policies because they don\u2019t make enough money. This may sound like the 47 percent of Americans who Mitt Romney said would vote against him because they don\u2019t pay income taxes and, therefore, don\u2019t take responsibility for themselves, or the 60 percent that Representative Paul Ryan argued pose a danger because they are \u201ctakers,\u201d getting more from the government than they pay in. Indeed, these are all basically the same thing. For the political right has always been uncomfortable with democracy. No matter how well conservatives do in elections, no matter how thoroughly free-market ideology dominates discourse, there is always an undercurrent of fear that the great unwashed will vote in left-wingers who will tax the rich, hand out largess to the poor, and destroy the economy.In fact, the very success of the conservative agenda only intensifies this fear. Many on the right \u2014 and I\u2019m not just talking about people listening to Rush Limbaugh; I\u2019m talking about members of the political elite \u2014 live, at least part of the time, in an alternative universe in which America has spent the past few decades marching rapidly down the road to serfdom. Never mind the new Gilded Age that tax cuts and financial deregulation have created; they\u2019re reading books with titles like \u201cA Nation of Takers: America\u2019s Entitlement Epidemic,\u201d asserting that the big problem we have is runaway redistribution.This is a fantasy. Still, is there anything to fears that economic populism will lead to economic disaster? Not really. Lower-income voters are much more supportive than the wealthy toward policies that benefit people like them, and they generally support higher taxes at the top. But if you worry that low-income voters will run wild, that they\u2019ll greedily grab everything and tax job creators into oblivion, history says that you\u2019re wrong. All advanced nations have had substantial welfare states since the 1940s \u2014 welfare states that, inevitably, have stronger support among their poorer citizens. But you don\u2019t, in fact, see countries descending into tax-and-spend death spirals \u2014 and no, that\u2019s not what ails Europe.Still, while the \u201ckind of politics and policies\u201d that responds to the bottom half of the income distribution won\u2019t destroy the economy, it does tend to crimp the incomes and wealth of the 1 percent, at least a bit; the top 0.1 percent is paying quite a lot more in taxes right now than it would have if Mr. Romney had won. So what\u2019s a plutocrat to do?One answer is propaganda: tell voters, often and loudly, that taxing the rich and helping the poor will cause economic disaster, while cutting taxes on \u201cjob creators\u201d will create prosperity for all. There\u2019s a reason conservative faith in the magic of tax cuts persists no matter how many times such prophecies fail (as is happening right now in Kansas): There\u2019s a lavishly funded industry of think tanks and media organizations dedicated to promoting and preserving that faith. Another answer, with a long tradition in the United States, is to make the most of racial and ethnic divisions \u2014 government aid just goes to Those People, don\u2019t you know. And besides, liberals are snooty elitists who hate America.A third answer is to make sure government programs fail, or never come into existence, so that voters never learn that things could be different.But these strategies for protecting plutocrats from the mob are indirect and imperfect. The obvious answer is Mr. Leung\u2019s: Don\u2019t let the bottom half, or maybe even the bottom 90 percent, vote. And now you understand why there\u2019s so much furor on the right over the alleged but actually almost nonexistent problem of voter fraud, and so much support for voter ID laws that make it hard for the poor and even the working class to cast ballots. American politicians don\u2019t dare say outright that only the wealthy should have political rights \u2014 at least not yet. But if you follow the currents of thought now prevalent on the political right to their logical conclusion, that\u2019s where you end up. The truth is that a lot of what\u2019s going on in American politics is, at root, a fight between democracy and plutocracy. And it\u2019s by no means clear which side will win. Advertisement"}

Cuomo, used to being in control, stared down forceful questioning of his ethical troubles. After months of remaining above the fray, Mr. Cuomo eagerly and sternly hit back on Wednesday night, exchanging blows with his Republican challenger, Rob Astorino, over taxes, bigotry and corruption.The first and likely only debate in this year\u2019s race for governor offered stretches of grim intensity punctuated by sharp attacks, with interludes provided by a pair of third-party candidates proposing some more unusual ideas.For Mr. Astorino, the debate, held in Buffalo, was his one extended moment on the same stage as Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, who has been eager to run out the clock before the Nov. 4 election and has taken care to avoid even mentioning his opponent by name.Mr. Astorino, the Westchester County executive, tried to prod, badger and embarrass the governor, hoping for a mistake, if not a meltdown, that could prompt voters to think twice about him.\u201cThere\u2019s only one person here that has a criminal defense team,\u201d Mr. Astorino said. \u201cIt\u2019s not me. It\u2019s Andrew Cuomo.\u201dMr. Cuomo, who takes care to avoid unscripted moments or unfriendly interviewers, plunged himself into a verbal brawl, offering punch after punch of his own. \u201cRhetoric is fine,\u201d the governor snapped early on. \u201cFacts are better.\u201dMr. Cuomo stuck to his message that he had gone to great lengths to turn around New York\u2019s struggling economy and dysfunctional government.\u00a0\u201cThe state is better because it\u2019s stronger, it\u2019s safer and it\u2019s more progressive,\u201d he said.Mr. Astorino, he argued, was guilty of financial mismanagement and of driving property taxes up in Westchester, the \u201chighest-taxed county in the United States of America,\u201d he said slowly, for emphasis.Mr. Astorino informed the audience, mercilessly or recklessly, that Mr. Cuomo \u201cvery well may be indicted after this Election Day comes and goes,\u201d before listing possible crimes, such as witness tampering and obstruction of justice.He challenged the governor, twice, to set the record straight, asking him to raise his right hand and say whether he or his staff members had been subpoenaed. Mr. Cuomo said the comment by Mr. Astorino was \u201coutrageous,\u201d and defended his handling of the commission, saying it led to worthy reforms.Mr. Cuomo attacked Mr. Astorino over his role in a long-running housing-discrimination dispute with the federal government. Westchester County has been in a standoff with the federal housing department over the county\u2019s compliance with a 2009 settlement that required it to push communities to alter zoning rules that discouraged construction of apartments.Portraying Mr. Astorino as an \u201cultraconservative\u201d who \u201cdisrespects\u201d women, minorities, gay people and immigrants, Mr. Cuomo reached back to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and then to the Civil War, as he tried to paint Mr. Astorino as intolerant.Mr. Astorino called the governor\u2019s suggestions about race \u201cdespicable,\u201d and cited endorsements from black and Hispanic leaders in Westchester. \u201cI would never have gotten that endorsement or their support,\u201d he said, \u201cif we were racist.\u201dThe debate also included the Green Party nominee, Howie Hawkins, a United Parcel Service worker from Syracuse, and the Libertarian, Michael McDermott, a real estate broker from Long Island. Mr. Hawkins pledged to represent the \u201c99 percent,\u201d while Mr. McDermott expressed frustration with Republicans and Democrats.The hourlong encounter was leavened by a few moments of comic relief, such as when Mr. McDermott said that the Common Core education standards were such an \u201cabomination\u201d that he had taken to doing his 9-year-old daughter\u2019s homework for her because \u201cshe just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d Mr. McDermott also earnestly trumpeted \u201cindustrial hemp\u201d as a source of both job creation and less expensive clothing. The debate was sponsored by The Buffalo News and WNED/WBFO, a public broadcaster. Mr. Astorino has repeatedly criticized Mr. Cuomo for not agreeing to a one-on-one televised debate. Even with the presence of the minor party candidates, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Astorino largely attacked each other.Mr. Astorino vowed to allow hydraulic fracturing, and criticized Mr. Cuomo for delaying a decision on whether to allow the contested form of natural gas extraction.Mr. Cuomo accused Mr. Astorino of having it both ways, offering what seemed like a rehearsed zinger that called attention to Mr. Astorino\u2019s signing of a bill banning fracking wastewater from being treated or used to de-ice roads in Westchester. \u201cWhen he goes upstate, he\u2019s Sarah Palin \u2014 \u2018Drill, baby, drill!\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cWhen he goes home to Westchester, he\u2019s Mark Ruffalo.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Officials Affirm Rate Outlook, but Seek Flexibility ", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Federal Reserve officials are looking for a new way to reassure investors that they are not ready to start raising interest rates, according to an account of the most recent meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee released on Wednesday.The Fed, pleased that the economy is improving and more Americans are finding jobs, plans to finish its latest bond-buying campaign at the end of October. But most officials at the September meeting said that they were far from satisfied with the economy\u2019s progress. And the account said some officials expressed concern that the slow growth of other major economies would start to weigh on the United States.The Fed sees a need to replace its guidance that it plans to keep short-term rates near zero for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after the end of its bond-buying campaign. The account suggests that officials are trying to find a new way to say the same thing. Most officials want to preserve the general perception that a first increase is most likely around the middle of the year. But they also are going out of their way to emphasize that the timing could change if job growth either exceeds or disappoints their expectations.\u201cThe consensus view is that liftoff will take place around the middle of next year,\u201d William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the influential vice chairman of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, said on Tuesday. \u201cThat seems like a reasonable view to me.\u00a0But, again, it is just a forecast.\u00a0What we do will depend on the flow of economic news and how that affects the economic outlook.\u201dInvestors appeared to welcome the cautious tone. Stocks rose sharply after the Fed released the account at 2 p.m. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed at 1,968.89, up 1.8 percent for the day. The interest rate on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell to its lowest level in more than a year, closing at 2.32 percent.The account, along with speeches by Fed officials in the three weeks since the meeting, show that the central bank is playing for time as it seeks greater clarity about the economy. Patience has become the Fed\u2019s new watchword.Job growth has been relatively strong this year, and the unemployment rate is fast falling toward what the Fed regards as a normal level. The economy added 248,000 jobs in September as the unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent. But inflation has been relatively weak. That\u2019s a problem in its own right; moderate inflation would encourage borrowing and spending and facilitates economic adjustments. The absence of wage inflation also suggests that the labor market is still slack and that most workers have little leverage to demand higher pay. The growth of other large economies is also lagging that of the United States, and some of those countries are pushing to devalue their currencies. Some Fed officials at the meeting expressed concerns these trends could undercut exporters and further suppress inflation. The Fed\u2019s staff reported it did not expect inflation to rise to the Fed\u2019s preferred 2 percent annual pace within the next several years.\u201cSome participants expressed concern that the persistent shortfall of economic growth and inflation in the euro area could lead to a further appreciation of the dollar and have adverse effects on the U.S. external sector,\u201d the account said. \u201cSeveral participants added that slower economic growth in China or Japan or unanticipated events in the Middle East or Ukraine might pose a similar risk.\u201dMost officials also agreed that problems in the labor market remain \u201csignificant,\u201d citing the depressed rate of labor force participation and the unusually large proportion of part-time workers, along with the low rate of wage inflation.The Fed appears to be moving closer to dropping its \u201cconsiderable time\u201d language, which is widely interpreted as meaning at least six months; most officials at the September meeting said they wanted to eliminate any reference to a timeline, and instead describe the decision as dependent on progress in increasing employment and raising the sluggish pace of inflation.This steady course has frustrated Fed officials who say the Fed should retreat more quickly, two of whom dissented at the committee\u2019s September meeting.An important unknown is the extent of slack remaining in the labor market. The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her supporters appear inclined to wait in the hopes that the data will help clarify the issue. Historically, wages and prices start to rise as the unemployment rate falls below 6 percent, as it has now done. If inflation instead remains sluggish, that would suggest a need for maintaining the Fed\u2019s stimulus.The willingness to wait is fortified by a sense that the risk of pulling back too soon, and leaving people without jobs, is greater than the risk of pressing too hard even if that means pushing inflation temporarily past the optimal level. Furthermore, Mr. Dudley said on Tuesday that he saw relatively little chance that economic growth would accelerate. The economy may be improving, but even the best case remains disappointing.

{"Headline": "The Land Grab Out West", "Date": "2014-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorALBUQUERQUE \u2014 LIKE a rerun of a bad Western, the battle over ownership of America\u2019s public lands has revived many a tired and false caricature of those of us whose livelihoods and families are rooted in the open spaces of the West.With a script similar to one used last spring by the Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, a small contingent of opportunistic politicians is vowing to dispose of America\u2019s national forests, conservation lands and open space. You may remember Mr. Bundy, whose refusal to pay more than $1 million in overdue grazing fees instigated a dangerous standoff with law enforcement officials. The confrontation made him the face of what some say is a renewed Sagebrush Rebellion to turn over America\u2019s public lands to state control.Mr. Bundy does not represent the West, however. And the campaign to transfer to the states or even sell off our shared lands should not be mistaken for the mainstream values of Westerners whose way of life depends on the region\u2019s land and water.In turn, the legislatures in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming have created task forces to study the idea, though similar efforts in Colorado and my home state of New Mexico have thus far failed. Proponents argue that states are better equipped to manage the West\u2019s natural wonders than the United States Forest Service and other national land management agencies. What they don\u2019t say is that their proposal would raise the possibility that some of the lands would be turned over to the highest bidder and that Western taxpayers would be saddled with the costs of overseeing the rest.Tellingly, while the Utah legislation excluded national parks and wilderness areas from lands that would be transferred to the state, the 1.7 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was not excluded. That may have something to do with a 1997 report by the Utah Geological Survey that concluded that Grand Staircase-Escalante \u201cincludes some of the most energy-rich lands in the lower 48 states.\u201dThe costs of managing these lands could bankrupt state governments. Over $3.9 billion was appropriated for federal wildfire management alone for the 2014 fiscal year. The only way states could foot the bill for administering America\u2019s public lands would be to raise taxes or sell or lease large expanses to developers and other private interests, including oil, gas, timber and mining companies.This would also result in a proliferation of locked gates and no-trespassing signs in places that have been open to the public and used for generations. This would devastate outdoor traditions like hunting, camping and fishing that are among the pillars of Western culture and a thriving outdoor recreation economy.Like many New Mexicans, my 11-year-old son and I just returned from an autumn elk hunt on national forest land. The bull elk that we brought home will feed our family for most of the coming year, but the experience of backpacking into the high country, sleeping on the ground and hearing the elk bugle around us will feed my son\u2019s imagination for years to come. If these lands end up in private hands, there is no guarantee that we will be able to go back year after year with the open access that Western sportsmen cherish.These types of land-grab schemes are as old as the railroads. But the chief salesman for this latest land seizure campaign, the American Lands Council, is having some success pitching state legislators on \u201cmodel legislation\u201d to enable these transfers. The legislation was drafted with the help of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, which receives financing from the utility industry and fossil-fuel producers. It is unclear whether such legislation is even enforceable.Like other Westerners who value our shared lands as assets to be used, enjoyed and passed to future generations, I find this dispiriting to see. And for an overwhelming majority of public land users in the West who pay their grazing fees and play by the rules, the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion of Cliven Bundy and the American Lands Council is not so much a movement as another special-interest-financed boondoggle.Admittedly, the federal government does not do a perfect job of managing America\u2019s public lands. There are real problems that need to be solved, like creating more access points for recreation, hunting and fishing, as my colleagues and I are proposing to do with a bill I introduced called the HUNT Act. But these are problems we can solve because of the very fact that these lands are public and we each have a voice in their management. America\u2019s forests, wildlife refuges and conservation lands are part of the fabric of our democracy. Let\u2019s keep them that way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Enforcer at Treasury Is First Line of Attack Against ISIS", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the clocks on the wall keep Zulu time, or Greenwich Mean Time, Mr. Cohen, Treasury\u2019s intelligence strategist and global enforcer, tries to track the Islamic State\u2019s shipments from its Syrian and Iraqi oil wells along well-worn smuggling routes across the border into Turkey. There the oil can be sold on the black market for as much as $60 a barrel \u2014 a deep discount from the standard rate of about $80, but still a windfall for the terrorist group.\u201cThat oil is finding its way to someone who is refining it and selling it, and presumably has some relationship with the formal financial sector, and that person is quite vulnerable to our sanctions as well as to our economic diplomacy,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in a recent interview. He declined to go into any detail about which countries or how much money he believes are involved.Mr. Cohen, a fastidious Yale Law School graduate who is known inside the White House as the administration\u2019s \u201cfinancial Batman,\u201d is a first line of attack against the Islamic State. His title is under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence and he may be more important in the fight against the Islamic State than the Tomahawks fired off American warships or the bombs dropped from F-16s. He has become a fixture in Mr. Obama\u2019s Situation Room.\u201cDavid plays the lead role in the effort to both monitor and stop the flow of illicit funds into illicit and terrorist activities, and ISIL is an example of where that is now currently a central concern,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in an interview, using an acronym for the Islamic State.But the effort to cut off Islamic State financing is so far proving as difficult as the American military campaign. The Sunni militants, considered the world\u2019s richest and most financially sophisticated terrorist group, control about a dozen oil fields in Iraq and Syria. The vast majority of the $100 million to $200 million in surplus income that experts estimate they will bring in this year is raised outside the traditional banking system. The group can bring in at least $1 million a day from its black-market oil sales, plus tens of millions more each year from extortion and ransom.\u201cThat creates big problems for David and for the U.S. government,\u201d said Juan C. Zarate, who had the No. 2 terrorism and financial crimes post under former President George W. Bush and is the author of \u201cTreasury\u2019s War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Financial Warfare.\u201dMr. Cohen is to outline the admininstration\u2019s strategy for shutting off the Islamic State\u2019s financial spigot in a speech on Thursday at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, his first extended public remarks on the topic.Before the Islamic State rose to prominence, Mr. Cohen was best known in the administration as the point man in shaping and carrying out a set of sanctions meant to cripple Iran\u2019s economy and force its leaders into talks to halt its progress toward developing a nuclear weapon. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that without David\u2019s relentless efforts, we would not be where we are in terms of getting the Iranians to the negotiating table with the chance of reaching a diplomatic solution,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, the deputy national security adviser.Yet Iran, which uses legitimate banks and seeks a full price for its oil, was \u2014 at least in comparison \u2014 straightforward. To follow the money within the Islamic State, Mr. Cohen must track the group\u2019s oil sales from black marketeer to black marketeer until the cash finally ends up traceable in a bank or financial institution.\u201cI will expect that we will have impact on ISIL\u2019s financial situation long before 36 months,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s estimate for how long it could take to destroy the group. \u201cBut this is not going to be a case of, we flip a light switch and all of a sudden all of their financial resources have disappeared.\u201dWhen he\u2019s not at the White House or at Treasury, Mr. Cohen travels the world working to enlist foreign governments in efforts by the United States to blackball bad actors from the international financial system and choke off their money supply.Last week he made a three-day trip to Doha, Qatar, and Jidda, Saudi Arabia, where he met with counterparts to discuss how to combat the Islamic State\u2019s financial networks. They were the 13th and 14th countries he has visited so far this year.He is leaning hard on Turkey to crack down on the black market sales, which benefit the country and its elite through the lower price of oil. Some reports suggest that Turkey may be beginning to do more to rein in the illegal trade, and the Obama administration last month bombed several Islamic State mobile refineries in Syria. Mr. Cohen will not say to what extent the airstrikes have hurt the Islamic State\u2019s oil revenues.What he will say is that 13 years ago Treasury\u2019s intelligence operations consisted of a single person sitting in a cramped room churning out reports for senior officials. Today Mr. Cohen presides over a 700-person, $200 million-a-year counterterrorism office within Treasury that was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He likes to point out that it includes the only in-house intelligence unit in any finance ministry in the world.\u201cI never dreamed of this job in particular because it didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Mr. Cohen, 51, said during the interview, conducted in his cavernous office at Treasury, next door to the White House. \u201cBut it is my dream job. I\u2019m able to touch pretty much every single national security issue we\u2019re facing.\u201dRaised a doctor\u2019s son in Boston, educated at Cornell, married to a fellow Yale Law School graduate and a father of two, Mr. Cohen describes himself as \u201csuper-compulsive\u201d about allowing no email to go unread and maintaining a clean inbox. He is similarly meticulous about his food intake, up to a point. On a recent afternoon he had a Cobb salad at his desk for lunch and gave in to temptation.\u201cI tried not to eat the egg, but I couldn\u2019t resist,\u201d he said.Colleagues say Mr. Cohen, who worked in the Treasury Department in the Clinton administration and in private practice before becoming No. 1 in the terrorist financing office in 2011, exudes a relaxed style but comes alive under pressure. \u201cWe\u2019re being looked to, often, to be the first set of substantive actions that the administration will take in response to a new threat,\u201d said Adam Szubin, the director of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which is responsible for enforcing the economic sanctions program. \u201cYou really have to be ready to make decisions, including pretty sensitive and sometimes controversial ones. He thrives on that kind of stress.\u201dBut in the interview, Mr. Cohen called it \u201cas excruciating a policy issue as we deal with here.\u201d\u201cYou look at the families of people who are being held hostage, and you can\u2019t help but feel it\u2019s horrible,\u201d Mr. Cohen added. \u201cIn each individual instance, it\u2019s a very difficult policy to adhere to, but we do because it is protective of U.S. citizens as a whole.\u201dIt is also critical to his overarching goal: cutting off the Islamic State\u2019s money in any way he can.He was in London for a speech in June, he said, when he first saw reports of the Sunni militants\u2019 sweep into Mosul. \u201cWe had been worrying about these guys, thinking about them before this,\u201d he said in the interview.Watching their advance across Iraq, he said he remembered thinking, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do even more work.\"Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Specter of Renewed Crisis Polarizes Europe", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Remember Europe?Just when eurozone leaders should be pulling together, there seems to be a widening rift between the European Central Bank and leaders in Germany, which has the region\u2019s largest economy and an outsize influence on the direction of the currency bloc. Simultaneously, a chill has set in between French and German leaders, whose ability to get along has always been indispensable to European crisis management.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has pressed Germany to temper its insistence on budget discipline and to spend more on public works to stimulate the eurozone economy. The French have cheered him on. German leaders have resisted, while making clear their opposition to the more powerful stimulus measures that analysts expect the E.C.B. to deploy soon.No wonder international investors are rattled. They fear that European leaders are farther apart than ever on how to pull the region\u2019s economy out of its long slump \u2014 and that the European Central Bank will not have the freedom it needs to take the extraordinary measures needed to stave off another crisis.\u201cGerman resistance against the E.C.B. pursuing more aggressive policy is one of the things spooking markets,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist in London at Berenberg, a German bank.Corporate leaders are worried, too. German manufacturers, whose exports of cars and machinery have helped prop up the whole eurozone, are increasingly concerned that the global economy is deteriorating and that policy makers are at a loss for remedies.Even as she cautioned against panic, Ms. Leibinger-Kamm\u00fcller listed reasons to worry about the global economy. They included slowing growth in China, the stagnant Japanese economy, Russia and renewed signs of trouble in Latin America.\u201cThe United States is the only ray of hope,\u201d she said.So far, the specter of a renewed crisis seems to have polarized European leaders. Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, is also a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council. He has become increasingly alienated from other members of the council over the question of how best to stimulate the economy.Speaking to an audience in Bielefeld, Germany, on Tuesday, Mr. Weidmann complained that E.C.B. policies had made things worse by encouraging commercial banks to \u201cfill up on high-interest bonds from crisis countries,\u201d therefore amplifying \u201cthe fatal interconnection between banks and governments.\u201dMr. Weidmann\u2019s comments came on the same day that the Court of Justice of the European Union heard arguments in a suit brought by a group of disgruntled Germans, including a member of Parliament, who want to prevent the European Central Bank from buying the bonds of eurozone governments.Yet the recent market turmoil increases pressure on the central bank to do just that \u2014 to buy government bonds in large volume, or in central bank parlance to engage in quantitative easing, as a way of pumping money into the economy and preventing deflation. Data published Thursday confirmed an earlier estimate that annual inflation in the eurozone in September was a scant 0.3 percent, far below the E.C.B. target of slightly less than 2 percent.Inflation that low is a symptom of a weak economy \u2014 and threatens to make things even worse. There is a danger that consumers will delay purchases because they expect lower prices in the future. If so, the result could be a deflationary spiral \u2014 a sustained outright drop in prices that would undercut corporate revenues and push unemployment, already at 11.5 percent, even higher.\u201cThe very low inflation reading for September will reinforce concern that the eurozone remains on a slippery slope to deflation,\u201d Martin van Vliet, an analyst at ING Bank in Amsterdam, said in a note to clients on Thursday.\u201cWith the cushion against deflation getting smaller and smaller and economic growth in the eurozone stagnating,\u201d Mr. van Vliet said, pressure on the E.C.B. to begin buying government bonds \u201cmay become overwhelming over the next few months.\u201dAlternative for Deutschland has drained votes from the Christian Democratic party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, and most likely encouraged her to take a hard line toward France after the French government said it would breach eurozone limits on national spending in an effort to stimulate the country\u2019s economy.The finance and economy ministers of France and Germany have agreed to meet in Berlin on Monday. Their challenge will be to reassure worried citizens that they are still capable of working together to solve Europe\u2019s problems.Rapprochement is no sure bet. Ms. Merkel said Thursday that there could be no exceptions to European Union rules on national deficit targets, according to Reuters.But in a hint that there may be some wiggle room in that stance, Ms. Merkel said during a speech to Parliament that she did not rule out measures to increase growth that would not conflict with her aim of achieving a balanced budget.During next Monday\u2019s meeting, the Germans are expected to push the French to loosen regulations on employment and to take other steps sought by business leaders. Germany, which made sweeping changes to job rules and social benefits a decade ago, has often presented itself as a role model for other eurozone countries.But signs of a slowdown in the German economy have exposed continuing weaknesses. Entrepreneurs, for example, complain of onerous red tape. Germany ranks a dismal 111th in how easy it is to start a business, according to the World Bank. Even France ranks higher by that measure, in 41st place. New Zealand, Canada and Singapore are in the top three spots in that list, while the United States is 20th.\u201cFrance is a good example when it comes to delaying much-needed fiscal reforms,\u201d said Ulf M. Schneider, chief executive of Fresenius Management, a German health care company. But he said that Germany lags in changes to improve its competitiveness.\u201cThe recent growth issues in Germany show that this country is not walking on water,\u201d Mr. Schneider said in an email. \u201cI am not aware of any meaningful pro-business and pro-investment policies that were implemented in recent years.\u201dTwo years ago, European leaders defied predictions of the common currency\u2019s demise by displaying more political will than the euro doubters had thought possible. The politicians now have their chance to confound the skeptics again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen Goes on Road to Investigate Health of the Jobs Market", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHELSEA, Mass. \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, went into the field Thursday to do some informal research about the health of the labor market. Ms. Yellen visited a two-year-old nonprofit program that is helping people to find work in this formerly industrial city just north of Boston and heard from organizers and job seekers that it is getting a little easier to earn a living.She also heard, however, that without the intensive support of the Connect program, many of its beneficiaries think they might still be looking for work \u2014 showing how difficult it can be for the many people who have lost jobs to find new ones.\u201cTwo years ago, at the beginning, to have anyone get hired was a huge deal,\u201d Anne Auerbach, a counselor for the Connect program, said after meeting Ms. Yellen. \u201cNow some people are getting hired. It has gotten somewhat better.\u201dMs. Yellen will speak Friday morning at a conference on economic inequality hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which organized Thursday\u2019s field trip.In her first year as Fed chairwoman, Ms. Yellen has made a point of showing public interest in the plight of the unemployed and in programs seeking to help them. Her first public speech after assuming the helm, in Chicago in April, highlighted the stories of three workers. That trip included a similar visit to a job-training program. She has maintained the view that the job market is far from good health, and that monetary policy can help, even as some Fed officials argue the Fed\u2019s work is done.On Thursday, Ms. Yellen took evident pleasure in hearing the stories of people who found jobs in recent months, beaming and congratulating them. She also pressed for information about the experience of looking for work.Are there particular skills that make candidates more desirable? If math makes a difference, how much math do people need? And several times, in slightly different ways, Has it gotten any easier to find work? Does it feel like it\u2019s getting better?Bin Qamruzzaman, a 34-year-old Marine Corps veteran, lost his job at a military contractor in a mass layoff in November and spent nine months looking for a new one. Ms. Yellen asked if the problem was a lack of skills or a lack of opportunities. Mr. Qamruzzaman, who has a degree in engineering, said that he saw plenty of listings, and shipped off plenty of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, but that companies did not respond.

{"Headline": "Robust Demand for Industrial Equipment Lifts General Electric\u2019s Profit 11%", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProfit slightly exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations, and revenue was a bit below. The modest revenue shortfall, G.E. executives said in a conference call, was explained by some gas and wind turbine sales that were pushed back a few months, and should be completed before the end of the year.Looking ahead, G.E. executives said they expected strong demand for equipment like rail locomotives and jet engines, with industrial orders over all up 22 percent. Orders in the United States rose 25 percent.Current orders signal future sales, and in their call with analysts, executives presented an optimistic outlook, despite the recent turbulence in the financial markets and falling oil prices. The company said that it expected industrial revenue growth for the year to beat the higher end of the 4-to-7-percent range projected previously. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a very strong fourth quarter,\u201d said Jeffrey S. Bornstein, G.E.\u2019s chief financial officer.The quarterly performance, said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research, was \u201cgood, and better than I had expected, especially the strength in orders.\u201dShares of G.E. closed at $24.82 on Friday, up 2.3 percent.The company reported net profit of $3.5 billion, an 11 percent increase from the year-earlier quarter. Its operating earnings from continuing operations, which exclude the impact from operations sold off or closed down, rose 6 percent, to 38 cents a share. That was slightly ahead of the average estimate of securities analysts of 37 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.G.E.\u2019s revenue across the corporation rose 1 percent, to $36.2 billion, from $35.7 billion last year. That was below the $36.8 billion forecast by Wall Street analysts.In China, G.E. is enjoying robust sales of its aviation and medical-imaging equipment, even though growth in the Chinese economy is slowing down. China, Mr. Immelt said, is \u201ca micro, not a macro, story.\u201dWith oil prices falling, Mr. Immelt said there was \u201cdefinitely a lot more caution\u201d in spending plans for oil field equipment. G.E. has built up its oil and gas equipment business so that it accounts for a rising share of the company\u2019s revenue and profit. According to Bernstein Research, the oil and gas unit will generate an estimated $19.5 billion in revenue this year, or 18 percent of G.E.\u2019s industrial revenue. A decade earlier, the oil and gas share was 4 percent.Yet across its industrial businesses, Mr. Immelt said, \u201cthe underlying activity is reasonably healthy.\u201dIn the quarter, revenue from the industrial businesses grew 4 percent, excluding the contribution from acquisitions. GE Capital\u2019s revenue declined 1 percent.Before the financial crisis, GE Capital routinely accounted for more than half of the corporation\u2019s profit. G.E.\u2019s goal is to reduce the share of its earnings that come from the finance unit to 25 percent by 2016. In the quarter, GE Capital contributed 39 percent of total earnings, and, G.E. executives said, the company is on track to hit its 2016 target.Another 2016 target is to lift the profit margins in its industrial business to 17 percent, and analysts say G.E.\u2019s cost-cutting efforts are on pace to attain that goal. At the end of last year, the profit margin on the industrial business was 15.7 percent. In the quarter, industrial margins rose nine-tenths of a percent from the year-earlier quarter. For G.E.\u2019s big industrial business, a 1 percent improvement in margins increases profits by more than $1 billion.So with a $250 billion backlog of orders, margin improvements add up. A crucial tactic in the G.E. game plan, said Brian K. Langenberg, an independent analyst, is to \u201ctake cost out to capture higher profit margins in their huge backlog of business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Homeland, Liberia Native Finds Resilience Amid Horror", "Date": "2014-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReporter's NotebookMONROVIA, Liberia \u2014 Liberians have become accustomed to living with demons.Long before Ebola arrived, the people here endured 14 years of civil war, one that snuffed out 200,000 lives and ignited acts of barbarism that laid waste to the country. The war produced mad generals who led ritual sacrifices of children before going into battle, naked except for shoes and a gun. It produced amphetamine-fueled 10-year-old fighters wielding M16s while toting teddy bear backpacks, and rapists who wore Halloween masks and wedding gowns. When it finally ended in 2003, what was left was a nation of survivors, a place where nearly every person of a certain age has a painful story to tell.I know this all too well, as a native Liberian who emigrated to the United States. My family has our own war stories. One sister was kidnapped and fought to protect her 1-year-old son while marching for days behind rebel lines. Another sister sent her son away to avoid the war and spent two years \u2014 two years \u2014 hiding deep up country in an area known only as Territory 3C, far from the worst of the conflict, after witnessing gunmen disembowel a co-worker in front of his son.I have long stopped asking people what happened to them during the war. But as I moved in recent weeks around this city where I was born, reporting about the Ebola epidemic, I was aware of this: There is a strength here that I had never before realized.My friend Wael Hariz, a Lebanese citizen living here who had been away for a couple of months, said he came back in late September expecting the worst, after watching the coverage of Ebola overseas. Standing just off Tubman Boulevard, Monrovia\u2019s main road, at midday, he looked at the cars, taxis and pedestrians going by. \u201cI had forgotten, after what they\u2019ve been through, how resilient people here are,\u201d he said.They came by that resilience the hard way. This is a staggeringly beautiful place, where tropical rain forests give way to pure white sandy beaches dotted by coconut trees. But the average Liberian lives on $1.25 a day, has no access to clean water and does not have a flush toilet at home. The average Liberian lives with mother, father, auntie, uncle and second cousins, sharing mattresses in cramped two-room shanties painted dark colors to ward off the equatorial sun. When one of those family members gets sick, the average Liberian picks through the muddy potholed dirt roads to Tubman Boulevard to hail a taxi to get to the nearest clinic.When Comfort Fayiah, 32, was turned away last month from a private hospital that demanded $450, she gave birth to twins in the dirt near Du Port Road. Passers-by surrounded her to try to give her what privacy they could, while a local woman and man delivered the two girls, Faith and Mercy.The new demon, of course, is Ebola, which has killed more than 2,000 Liberians and has struck double that number, crippled the country\u2019s health system, ground the economy to a standstill and made international pariahs of anyone with a Liberian passport. Those facing it close up are fearful of what could happen and often angry that they are largely left on their own. But many Liberians are treating the disease with much the same resignation as the killers of the past \u2014 accepting that the threat is there, and doing their best to navigate around it. They wash their hands with chlorine, they walk up to the laser thermometers at the entrances of public buildings to check their temperature. They still take care of family members who fall ill because there is no other alternative.I have been trying to be as unruffled as my Liberian compatriots, but I\u2019ve been living in the United States for too long now. My tolerance for risk has gone way down.I have been consumed with worry. My oldest sister is a health care worker in Liberia who is deeply involved in the Ebola response. Another sister, Eunice, is a pensions manager at the Firestone rubber company; every day pensioners line up outside her office 35 miles from Monrovia and reach their hands toward her to receive their checks. My 9-year-old niece, Nyepu, who has sickle-cell anemia, has been locked in the house since July, and is busting at the seams to get out. I have nightmares that she will escape and the worst will happen.Packing to come here, I brought rehydration tablets for one sister, a box of latex gloves for the other and a portable DVD player for my niece. Visiting Eunice and her family, I admonished Nyepu not to touch me \u2014 I had been in an Ebola treatment unit. When Eunice and I took a picture together to send back to our third sister in the United States, we made sure not to touch.Two days after I arrived in Monrovia, news broke that an Ebola case had been diagnosed at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, the first in the United States. American officials said they were not releasing the name of the patient, citing confidentiality, but Liberia\u2019s health minister, Dr. Walter T. Gwenigale, was having none of it. \u201cI throw that out the window,\u201d he said during a meeting with visiting health officials. \u201cThere is no privacy in Ebola.\u201dJust like people in the United States, everyone in Monrovia was talking about the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, the patient in Dallas. The biggest question here was whether the United States would prevent Liberians from traveling to America. It is not as if many of them get visas anyway; the fortress that is the United States Embassy, perched on a hill in the diplomatic enclave of Mamba Point, is so barricaded that even a recent high-level American delegation had to wait outside for 20 minutes before being passed through the gates.But what if President Obama pulls out the United States troops he has sent to build treatment units? When Mr. Duncan died, the first Ebola fatality in the United States, there was suspicion in Monrovia of both governments. \u201cThey wanted him to die, to teach us a lesson\u201d not to try to go to America in hopes of surviving the disease, a friend told me.Her tone was matter of fact. Life here comes with a higher level of risk.A few days ago, I went up country to cover President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. I stayed overnight in Gbarnga, but had to return to Monrovia, four hours away, at 5 a.m. A member of the president\u2019s security detail whom I know, Varsay Sirleaf, hopped into the car with me. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want you going alone,\u201d he said.I knew it was pointless to argue. Besides, the road was part dirt, potholed, and dark; one flat tire and you are finished.About 30 minutes after setting out, on the blackest stretch of the road, the headlights picked up a form on the side. \u201cStop!\u201d Varsay yelled. \u201cThat\u2019s a body!\u201d He jumped out of the car, grabbing a flashlight and a pistol. \u201cLock the doors,\u201d he said, and took off.My mind immediately went to the civil war, to magic soldiers jumping out of the bush. It was quiet except for my heart beating.Finally, Varsay returned. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t dead,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was drunk. I woke him up, and he went into the bush.\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe he had just gone up to a body on the side of the road. \u201cIt could have been an ambush!\u201d I cried. \u201cHe could have had Ebola!\u201dVarsay looked at me. \u201cThat what y\u2019all do in America?\u201d he asked.He turned back toward the front, looking ahead. Then, he spoke again.\u201cYou can\u2019t just leave somebody on the side of the road to die.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kansas Faces Additional Revenue Shortfalls After Tax Cuts", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBusting the BudgetKansas has missed its tax revenue targets again, and the state is in for new fiscal pain as a result.Revenue numbers for July through September, the first three months of fiscal year 2015, suggest Kansas\u2019 revenue gap is permanent, not temporary. The state anticipated $578 million in personal income tax collections over the summer, but it took in just $524 million, an overestimate of more than 10 percent. That was nationally atypical; according to the Rockefeller Institute of Government, 14 states have published projected and actual monthly personal income tax receipts through September, and the other 13 all came within 5 percent of expectations.Kansas\u2019 wide miss was probably a result of wading into uncharted territory with its tax reforms. In addition to cutting income tax rates, Kansas made itself the only state with a general personal-income tax that exempts \u201cpass-through income\u201d from tax.Business entities like S-corporations and limited liability companies are not taxed at the corporate level; instead, their income is passed through to their owners, who then pay personal income tax on the profits in most states \u2014 but not Kansas.One problem with this policy is that pass-through income and wage income are often fungible. A small-business owner might choose to take less of his income as (taxable) salary and more as (tax-free) profits, reducing Kansas income tax revenues. Estimating how many small-business owners would make such changes was the key to figuring out the cost of the tax cuts.\u201cI think there is major reshuffling of how people are paying their taxes,\u201d says Duane Goossen, who served as budget director under the three governors who preceded Mr. Brownback, including the Republican Bill Graves and the Democrat Kathleen Sebelius. \u201cYou have every incentive to push your salary down and take all of your income as profit.\u201dMr. Stotts, the taxation director, expressed hope that revenues would be stronger in the spring; he noted that taxpayers who make quarterly estimated tax payments are setting those payments based on last year\u2019s tax bills, which (given last year\u2019s revenue shortfall) were low. If incomes are strong this year, the resulting boost in revenues may show up in final payments made with tax returns filed in the spring, rather than estimated payments made this summer and fall.On the other hand, another income tax rate cut is scheduled to go into effect in January, which will weigh on tax collections in 2015. All told, Mr. Stotts said he suspected the state\u2019s revenue-estimating group would cut the state\u2019s revenue projections shortly after the election, at its next scheduled meeting. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much,\u201d he said.There could be even bigger problems to come, because Kansas\u2019 income tax estimates for the next nine months are actually more optimistic than this summer\u2019s were. In fiscal year 2014, Kansas collected 26 percent of its personal income taxes in the summer quarter. But in forecasting this fiscal year\u2019s revenues, Kansas attributed only 23 percent of expected annual personal income tax revenue to the summer \u2014 and then missed its projection anyway. If summer revenues make up 26 percent of total revenues, as they did last year, the state will be short by closer to $500 million than $250 million. And in addition to needing to close this year\u2019s gap, the state will start deeper in the hole for fiscal year 2016, for which it already has a projected budget shortfall of $240 million.An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of a former budget director in Kansas.

{"Headline": "A Final Rush, for Everyone but Perry", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneAUSTIN \u2014 As Election Day looms, Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick, the Republican candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, are touring together \u2014 a new thing for them. The Democrats they face, Wendy Davis and Leticia Van de Putte, have been together off and on from the start.Joint appearances with other candidates offer a peek at who the contestants think will add to and subtract from their campaigns. Watch who they run to, who they run from and who they just ignore. The teams at the top of the two major-party tickets have decided appearing together is an additive. Celebrities work, too: Mr. Abbott made a couple of appearances this week with the actor Chuck Norris, a conservative star, and the actress Eva Longoria spoke at the start of Ms. Van de Putte\u2019s statewide bus tour a few days ago. The top elected Republican in the state, Gov. Rick Perry, has been virtually invisible. Instead, he is operating in another political zone, audaciously urging a National Guard deployment on the Texas-Mexico border, publicly trying to deal with the Ebola scare in Texas and making foreign policy speeches in London and California intended to unveil a prospective presidential candidate\u2019s views on America\u2019s place in the world.Spin it Mr. Perry\u2019s way \u2014 that the state races are behind him now that his sights are set on national office. Or spin it the way the candidates might think \u2014 that a fresh start for a new government would be stained by the legacy of a governor who has been in office 14 years. Mr. Perry\u2019s record is at the center of many Democratic campaigns, where candidates are reminding voters of education cuts and holes in the state\u2019s health and welfare safety nets. And it is evident in some Republican campaigns, too, where candidates have raised questions about \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d and irregularities with economic incentive funds run by the governor\u2019s office. He is the man without a face this year. President Obama\u2019s face, however, is everywhere.Democrats all over the country have spent the better part of the year avoiding the president. His popularity is at a low point, and Democrats remember the drubbing they got in the president\u2019s first midterm election in 2010. That was the rise of the Tea Party and an anti-Washington dust storm so thick it even took out some popular Republicans, like United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who lost that year\u2019s primary for governor to Mr. Perry.When the president visited Texas to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the federal Civil Rights Act, Ms. Davis met with him, but not publicly. The Davis campaign did not want to provide the Republicans with usable evidence that he and she were confederates. In the first debate between Mr. Abbott and Ms. Davis, the strained association was evident; given a chance to ask Davis a question, Mr. Abbott asked if she regretted voting for Mr. Obama for president.She balked. \u201cMr. Abbott, what I am working on right now is running for governor of this incredible state and bringing polices forward that benefit this state,\u201d Ms. Davis said. In an interview the next day, she rebooted. \u201cThere are things our president has done I agree wholeheartedly with,\u201d she said at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. \u201cThere are things I disagree with too. In my area of the state, both President Obama and Greg Abbott tried to intervene and stop the merger between US Airways and American Airlines. Do you understand what that would have done for the economy of the state? Neither of them showed an understanding of the economic engine that is American Airlines.\u201dA month later, running behind in the polls with a few days left in her campaign, Ms. Davis might be the only prominent Democrat in the country saying she would welcome a political visit from the president. Maybe it would excite Democratic voters to her advantage. Running away was no help: Even without a photograph of the two, Mr. Abbott ran a commercial that concluded a vote for her would be a vote for \u201cGovernor Obama.\u201d Funny: The state\u2019s actual governor was barely mentioned.rramsey@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the U.S., a Turning Point in the Flow of Oil", "Date": "2014-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEnergy Special SectionHOUSTON \u2014 The Singapore-flagged tanker BW Zambesi set sail with little fanfare from the port of Galveston, Tex., on July 30, loaded with crude oil destined for South Korea. But though it left inauspiciously, the ship\u2019s launch was another critical turning point in what has been a half-decade of tectonic change for the American oil industry.The 400,000 barrels the tanker carried represented the first unrestricted export of American oil to a country outside of North America in nearly four decades. The Obama administration insisted there was no change in energy trade policy, perhaps concerned about the reaction from environmentalists and liberal members of Congress with midterm elections coming. But many energy experts viewed the launch as the curtain raiser for the United States\u2019 inevitable emergence as a major world oil exporter, an improbable return to a status that helped make the country a great power in the first half of the 20th century.\u201cThe export shipment symbolizes a new era in U.S. energy and U.S. energy relations with the rest of the world,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian. \u201cEconomically, it means that money that was flowing out of the United States into sovereign wealth funds and treasuries around the world will now stay in the U.S. and be invested in the U.S., creating jobs. It doesn\u2019t change everything, but it certainly provides a new dimension to U.S. influence in the world.\u201dLike just about everything else in the oil and gas business, petroleum exports are contentious. The oil bounty is thanks to modern production techniques including hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which involves injecting water and chemicals into the ground to crack oil-saturated shale. Exports would mean more of that. Many environmentalists say fracking operations endanger water supplies or create other hazards, including air pollution. Ramping up exports of fossil fuels, critics will surely note, is inconsistent with the Obama administration\u2019s push for a global climate deal.Independent refiners argue that exports could mean more expensive domestic oil for them, which they say could mean higher prices for American consumers.Oil companies, and many independent economists, say just the opposite is true, because American exports would add to global supplies and lower international oil benchmark prices that ultimately determine the rise and fall of American gasoline prices. And with Russia causing mischief in Europe and the Middle East in turmoil, many analysts say allies would be happy to have a dependable supplier of oil. The oil companies appear to be grinding out a road to victory just as they have gained momentum in promoting natural gas exports against the opposition of some chemical companies and environmental groups that want to curb drilling and fracking. The Energy Department has begun a major study on the merits of exports, and how they would affect American consumers and United States energy security. Their previous study on gas exports backed the industry position.A global oil price collapse, as unlikely as that might seem, is a wild card that could change the equation and stem momentum toward exports. Low prices, because of either excess supplies or reduced demand, would discourage investments and drilling worldwide.Whatever the merits, the prospect of the United States becoming a major oil exporter was unthinkable as recently as 2008, when the conventional wisdom had it that the country was \u201caddicted\u201d \u2014 a word that even President George W. Bush famously used \u2014 to imported oil from unstable or unfriendly countries. Domestic production had been in free fall for decades as repeated presidential promises of \u201cenergy independence\u201d echoed hollowly. But then came the frenzy of drilling in shale oil and gas fields across the country.Domestic oil production has rocketed by roughly 70 percent over the last six years to 8.7 million barrels a day, and imports from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have already been cut roughly by half. With domestic oil production growing month after month, many oil experts predict that the country\u2019s output will rise to as much as 12 million barrels a day over the next decade, which would mean the country will be swimming in oil the way it is currently dealing with a surplus of natural gas.Analysts at Turner, Mason & Company, a Dallas engineering consulting firm, say the country could hit a saturation point when production hits 10 million to 10.5 million barrels a day, at which point large exports will become necessary or drilling and production may have to slow.\u201cA flood is upon us,\u201d John Auers, a Turner, Mason senior vice president, recently told energy executives at a Houston oil conference. \u201cWe are getting close.\u201dThe country will continue to import some grades of oil for years to come, but energy experts says oil exports should rise significantly over the next few years because of a mismatch in the type of oil the country now increasingly produces and the mix of oil its refineries were designed to process. Shale oil is predominately light, sweet oil, meaning it is low in sulfur content and flows freely at room temperature. American refineries can refine only so much of it because they were structured to process abundant amounts of much heavier crudes imported from Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. That is leading to a crude-oil glut in parts of the country\u2019s midsection already \u2014 which has pushed oil companies to lobby for expanded exports and directly led to that recent shipment from Galveston.The Galveston sailing was historic because the United States has strictly limited exports since the era of the Arab oil embargo, when President Jimmy Carter wore a cardigan sweater to encourage lower thermostats and other measures to limit the country\u2019s dependence on foreign oil. In sweeping legislation, Congress in 1975 directed the president to prohibit the export of oil as \u201cconsistent with the national interest,\u201d although broad exemptions were allowed. Various administrations since then have permitted limited exports, including shipments from Alaska\u2019s Cook Inlet and to Canada, but the issue rarely came up because the country was seemingly running out of oil.Then suddenly the energy world changed, and parts of the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico regions were overflowing with light grades of crude, leading to a slump in prices and a gap of as much as $15 between the United States oil benchmark and the prevailing Brent world price. Unable to export the excess light crude, the industry exported refined products like gasoline and diesel instead. In 2011, the country pivoted from being the world\u2019s largest importer of petroleum products to becoming one of the leading exporters.But the buildup in light crude has continued to outpace the capacity of refiners to process and export it, and that has spurred new thinking in Washington. In what appeared to be a trial balloon, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz last December suggested to reporters at a New York energy conference that it may be time for the administration to reconsider the export ban. \u201cThere are lots of issues in the energy space that deserve some new analysis and examination in the context of what is now an energy world that is no longer like the 1970s,\u201d Mr. Moniz said at the time.The first baby step toward a new policy came in June when the Commerce Department approved applications from two Texas energy companies, Pioneer Natural Resources and Enterprise Products Partners, to export light liquid hydrocarbons known as condensates that are normally characterized as crude oil even though they share attributes of both oil and natural gas and normally are found in gas form in the ground. The government ruled that since the companies had minimally processed the condensates through a simple oil processing unit that separates the gas and makes it safe for transport, the result was now considered a refined product.Since refined products like gasoline and diesel are legal to export, the Obama administration said that the decision did not signal a reversal of the crude oil trade limits. Nevertheless, oil company executives and many Wall Street analysts who follow the oil industry interpreted the move as being a fundamental shift in direction. The country can now potentially export 300,000 barrels a day of condensates, most of which come out of the Eagle Ford shale oil field of South Texas, easing some of the glut of a product refiners cannot absorb and thus improving the profitability of drilling in the zone.But the wording of the Commerce Department ruling means oil producers can potentially export much more than just condensates, since the department said it covered all crude oil that is processed through a distillation unit. Basic distillation can occur at the wellhead at minimal cost, and the new interpretation is likely to unleash investment in basic processing of oil in the field to meet the export requirements.\u201cIt was another crack in a process that is historic,\u201d said Eric G. Lee, a commodities strategist at Citigroup.Oil exports (including condensates) remain small, but they have already surged from 67,000 barrels a day in 2012 to 120,000 barrels a day in 2013 to more than double that currently. Citi Research estimates that under the new condensates ruling, exports could hit a million barrels a day by next year.Last month, the first tanker since 2004 loaded with Alaskan North Slope crude for export set sail \u2014 800,000 barrels purchased by South Korea. While Alaskan crude is excluded from the current ban, the shipment showed that West Coast refineries that normally buy the Alaskan oil have ample supplies from the Lower 48. Much of the additional exported oil is expected to go to Canada and Mexico, also allowable under current restrictions, but the export growth will probably not be enough to dent the continuing upsurge in domestic production for more than a few years at most.Another way the country is easing some of the glut is by exporting more refined products like gasoline and diesel. Exports of refined petroleum products have already soared to 3.4 million barrels a day from 2.3 million barrels a day in 2010. But most oil experts say that growth in such exports will be limited by United States refinery capacity and available export markets, especially if refineries planned in Latin America \u2014 a major market for American products \u2014 are completed.That will leave exports of crude to soak up the excess production, but there are still political hurdles. United States exports of oil could reach three million to four million barrels a day in a few years, more than most OPEC producers currently provide world markets.But politicians are afraid they will be targets of broadsides that a reversal of the 39-year-old policy to export domestic production could risk American energy security, or raise gasoline prices. Republican members of Congress from oil-patch states like Texas and Louisiana might be expected to support exports, but many are also dependent on the campaign support of independent domestic refiners like Tesoro and Valero and their workers, who want to keep the price of American oil low to bolster profit margins.Most oil experts say that a loosening of the export limitations will have to wait until at least the midterm elections and maybe even until after the 2016 presidential election campaign, when the issue will probably be amply discussed.\u201cThe politics are hard,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, the State Department\u2019s coordinator for international energy affairs in the first Obama administration. But he added, \u201cWhen the economics become overwhelming, the politics will shift.\u201dFor Mr. Goldwyn, American oil exports would increase Washington\u2019s credibility in global trade talks, where the nation typically argues that countries with excess supplies should export them. They would allow China and India to diversify their supplies from the Middle East, and Europe to diversify from Russia, the Middle East and North Africa. Adding United States oil to world supplies would bring down the global Brent oil price benchmark, which would bolster the world economy, they argue.The refiners disagree that American consumers would benefit, especially those who live in the Northeast and along the West Coast, who get their fuels from local refineries. Those coastal refineries depend on low domestic prices to offset high transport costs since they are so far from the Texas and North Dakota shale oil fields. With insufficient pipelines, coastal refineries are obliged under current maritime laws to transport domestic oil in a most expensive fashion \u2014 by barges that must be American-built and flagged; majority American-owned and manned by crews that are predominately American.More United States exports would almost certainly raise domestic oil prices to the higher levels on the world market, refiners argue, forcing the coastal refineries to raise their gasoline prices and making it more difficult for them to compete against foreign refiners on world markets. For Bill Day, a Valero vice president, those who argue for free trade in oil are missing the point that the international oil business is inherently not free because prices are largely controlled by OPEC and others who do not believe in free trade. \u201cTo us this should be a question of economics, pragmatism and good business sense rather than ideology,\u201d Mr. Day said.The refiners are joined in an unlikely alliance by congressional liberals like Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who argue that an extra couple of million barrels a day of American production will not bring down global oil prices as long as OPEC remains in a dominant position to manipulate prices by increasing or decreasing output at will. Senator Markey noted that the United States still imports a third of the oil it uses, about the same proportion as when Congress limited exports 39 years ago.Many oil experts say that the debate will be settled when American oil production rises to such a high level that there are no longer adequate domestic markets for the sweet crude oil produced in the shale fields. That could happen as soon as 2017, some oil executives say. The telltale sign of a glut will be a collapse in the West Texas Intermediate price, the principal American oil benchmark price, which is currently about $3 below the world Brent price. That differential has been as high as $28 in recent years, but has been relieved by additional pipelines bringing American production to domestic markets and refineries for export of finished products.If the spread cracks open, the economic arguments for free export of domestic crude will probably win the day, many energy experts say, while a narrower spread would keep the debate going. Many oil experts say it is only a matter of time before a much steeper spread emerges \u2014 leading to trouble for an industry that has done much to keep the national economy afloat in recent years. Gluts of domestic oil are already mounting in West Texas.\u201cYou would see a significant reduction in drilling, resulting in a significant reduction in production, a significant reduction in employment in the industry,\u201d predicted Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the two companies that won the initial condensate export approvals.The White House and Congress would not let that happen, oil executives say.Not surprisingly, Senator Markey took a different view: \u201cThey claim that exporting American oil to China will be good for oil companies and there will be no impact on American consumers and industries and our national security. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One province, Nangarhar, was declared \u201cpoppy-free\u201d by the United Nations in 2008, but between 2012 and 2013, it had a fourfold increase in production.The narcotics program embraced multiple strategies, including interdicting drug traffickers, eradicating poppy fields, strengthening the Afghan legal system to prosecute drug dealers, persuading farmers to grow alternative crops and establishing treatment programs for addicts. The Pentagon, one of the lead agencies in the effort, has pinned the failure to reduce cultivation largely on a lack of support from the Afghan government.The American embassy in Kabul has said that the United States will help him in these efforts. The allies must pitch in as well. But one early order of business is to figure out where the counternarcotics strategy went wrong \u2014 why so much investment over the years has produced so little. An honest evaluation is a necessary first step to constructing a strategy that works and gives the new government a realistic shot at building a productive economy and a stable nation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Islamist Party in Tunisia Concedes to Secularists ", "Date": "2014-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThough just a few official results had been released on Monday night, Ennahda\u2019s leader, Rachid Ghannouchi, called Beji Caid Essebsi, the 87-year-old leader of Nidaa Tounes, on Monday evening to congratulate him. Mr. Ghannouchi then threw a large street party for party workers outside Ennahda\u2019s campaign headquarters, with music and fireworks. Ennahda\u2019s former foreign minister, Rafik Abdessalem, said that by the party\u2019s count, Ennahda had won 69 to 73 seats, while Nidaa Tounes had most likely won 83 seats.\u201cWe accept the result,\u201d Mr. Abdessalem said. \u201cThere are some irregularities, but we consider we succeeded in this process to hold transparent democratic elections.\u201d Mr. Essebsi told French television France 24 that even though the official results were not completed, he had accepted Mr. Ghannouchi\u2019s congratulations with appreciation. His party announced its victory on its Facebook page. \u201cWe won,\u201d it said. \u201cLong live Tunisia.\u201dThe swing away from Ennahda, a large, well-organized party built along the lines of the Muslim Brotherhood with deep roots throughout the country, to Nidaa Tounes surprised many. Nidaa Tounes is a newly formed alliance of former government officials, left-wing politicians and secularists, who came together in 2012 in opposition to the Islamists. The party had appeared unorganized and divided internally, while Ennahda was known to have a committed and disciplined core of supporters. Many Ennahda members had emerged from prison or had returned from exile after the revolution and were afforded some sympathy. Yet they proved largely inexperienced and unable to manage the mounting instability, and alienated many by allowing a rapid spread of Islamist groups, some of which turned to violence.Mr. Essebsi, an experienced statesman who served in previous governments as minister, ambassador and president of Parliament, co-founded Nidaa Tounes and quickly placed it as an alternative to the creeping Islamist threat and the growing insecurity. The party became the center of the opposition movement, including some two million people who had worked for the government and party under Mr. Ben Ali and felt threatened by the revolution. Political analysts and election observers said the signs of popular frustration were evident, and the election result was a clear protest vote against the Ennadha government. The underlying divisions in Tunisian society, an Arab Muslim nation that has an ancient Mediterranean history, and lived under influences of French colonialism and forced secularism for more than 50 years since independence, are also well established and explain some of the backlash against the Islamists, analysts and observers added. \u201cEnnahda lost for three reasons,\u201d Mr. Chegrouche said. \u201cThe increase in unemployment, the economy and their perceived laxity against terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all this together. And people voted for a single force that could combat that.\u201d Voters did not support the array of small parties, but the one sizable party that could inspire confidence and stability, he said. International observers following the elections said there had been high expectations after the Tunisian revolution and widespread frustration at the government\u2019s failure to deliver on those expectations. \u201cThere is nothing like experience in governance to teach a lesson,\u201d said Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute, who was following the election in Tunisia.After two political assassinations last year, an incipient insurgency and rising insecurity, Ennahda was forced to step down and hand over to a caretaker government. Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa, a technocrat, has been leading the government since January but said in an interview last week that no government could fix the economy quickly after a revolution. \u201cThat is revolution; social and political tensions and a lot of disorder,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can look like a television drama. You need time.\u201dEarly results also showed a surprise gain for the party of the tycoon Slim Riahi, who ran a flashy campaign that included pop concerts. Western officials support the idea of Nidaa Tounes and Ennahda collaborating to form a national unity government, bringing in some of the smaller parties as well.Yet Mr. Essebsi may try to form a government with the smaller parties and leave Ennahda in opposition. No one is expecting a rapid formation of the new government, and both parties have agreed to wait for presidential elections next month, with a possible runoff in December, to allow the new president to appoint a prime minister.

{"Headline": "Ebola Outbreak Erodes Recent Advances in West Africa", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the breach, Ebola is fast washing away the small gains made over the last decade in war-scarred parts of West Africa, as schools shut down, immunization campaigns are suspended and a food crisis looms as farmers abandon their fields.Donors had spent millions of dollars in an effort to strengthen the public health systems of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone long before the three countries became the center of the Ebola outbreak. Aid agencies of the United Nations have been active there for decades, with projects to train health workers, improve child mortality rates and get more children into school. United Nations peacekeepers helped shore up Sierra Leone for 20 years, since the end of its crippling war; Liberia had some 5,000 peacekeepers when the outbreak began this year.Now, a virus that doctors have controlled elsewhere has ballooned in West Africa, unraveling many of the gains made in these countries in recent years and potentially threatening the hard-won stability of this tinderbox part of the world.Some clashes and strikes have broken out. Tensions are simmering between neighbors in the region, who have long fueled wars in one another\u2019s countries. The International Fund for Agricultural Development, another United Nations agency, warned last week that the Ebola epidemic could \u201clead to a hunger crisis of epic proportions.\u201dYet, only two months ago, the Security Council was considering scaling back its peacekeeping mission in the region more quickly, because United Nations troops were required in other countries. That proposal has since been suspended, and the United Nations is now clearly trying to make sure it can hold on to the blue-helmeted soldiers that it has on the ground, which may not be easy. The Philippines has announced that it will pull its troops from Liberia, citing Ebola risks.\u201cIt seems obvious now that the health crisis could have knock-on effects on the economy and so on, but that wasn\u2019t apparent\u201d earlier, said a United Nations diplomat who did not want to be identified in keeping with diplomatic protocol.The United Nations has taken pains to assure diplomats that the peacekeeping mission has done all that it could to fight Ebola, including by spreading public health messages on its radio network, donating cars and body bags to the Liberian government, and helping to level the ground for the construction of treatment centers, according to a confidential memo to the Council. The United Nations has spent upward of $8 billion on the peacekeeping mission in Liberia since 2003.Now, the United States is sending 4,000 soldiers to build Ebola treatment centers in Liberia. Britain and France are separately sending their own forces to build centers in their former colonies, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The biggest gap now is staffing. The United Nations emergency Ebola mission says the 19,000 doctors, nurses and paramedics are needed by Dec. 1. By then, 10,000 Ebola patients could be pouring in each week. To turn around the transmission rate, the United Nations has set an ambitious goal: to isolate at least 70 percent of the sick and conduct safe burials for at least 70 percent of the dead.\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere close to the money we require, nowhere close to the personnel we require, nowhere close to the assets we require,\u201d Anthony Banbury, the head of the United Nations mission to contain Ebola, said by phone from Accra, Ghana, after reviewing the needs on the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable.\u201dJan Egeland, a former United Nations official and now head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said his group could not send health experts to West Africa until they were assured of proper care if they get Ebola and of being treated in an Ebola-free hospital if they are in an accident. The United States military is now building a treatment center for foreign aid workers in Monrovia, the Liberian capital; it is projected to be ready by early next month. The European Union recently announced a medical evacuation system for international health workers.\u201cAll of this should have been fixed early on\u201d by the United Nations, in cooperation with the United States and European Union, Mr. Egeland said.Aid has picked up since the Security Council\u2019s appeals. The United States plans to build 18 treatment centers across Liberia. Germany is building a treatment center in Sierra Leone and another in Liberia, and using its military aircraft to transport supplies for the United Nations. China announced that it would send motorcycles to help track the disease, along with $6 million for food to those who are quarantined. A consortium of East African countries have promised to send 600 health workers.But hospitals are needed for non-Ebola patients, too, and even before the Ebola outbreak, Liberia had a severe shortage of medical staff. \u201cThe focus, rightly so, has been to set up treatment centers, but if you have people coming to them with malaria, labor complications or other health needs, there are currently no hospitals or clinics to safely refer them,\u201d said Kris Torgeson, a liaison officer for Doctors Without Borders in Liberia.Mr. Banbury, who was in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, working to muster an international response, called the Ebola epidemic the toughest and most complex humanitarian crisis he had ever seen.Haiti is a critical object lesson for the United Nations. The earthquake was followed by a deadly cholera outbreak, and the United Nations has never addressed whether its peacekeepers were to blame. It faces a class-action lawsuit over cholera. Nor has it come close to rallying donors to help Haiti curb the disease once and for all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Pump War?", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs it just my imagination or is there a global oil war underway pitting the United States and Saudi Arabia on one side against Russia and Iran on the other? One can\u2019t say for sure whether the American-Saudi oil alliance is deliberate or a coincidence of interests, but, if it is explicit, then clearly we\u2019re trying to do to President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, exactly what the Americans and Saudis did to the last leaders of the Soviet Union: pump them to death \u2014 bankrupt them by bringing down the price of oil to levels below what both Moscow and Tehran need to finance their budgets.Think about this: four oil producers \u2014 Libya, Iraq, Nigeria and Syria \u2014 are in turmoil today, and Iran is hobbled by sanctions. Ten years ago, such news would have sent oil prices soaring. But today, the opposite is happening. Global crude oil prices have been falling for weeks, now resting around $88 \u2014 after a long stretch at $105 to $110 a barrel.The price drop is the result of economic slowdowns in Europe and China, combined with the United States becoming one of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers \u2014 thanks to new technologies enabling the extraction of large amounts of \u201ctight oil\u201d from shale \u2014 combined with America starting to make exceptions and allowing some of its newfound oil products to be exported, combined with Saudi Arabia refusing to cut back its production to keep prices higher, but choosing instead to maintain its market share against other OPEC producers. The net result has been to make life difficult for Russia and Iran, at a time when Saudi Arabia and America are confronting both of them in a proxy war in Syria. This is business, but it also has the feel of war by other means: oil.Indeed, the late Yegor Gaidar, who between 1991 and 1994 was Russia\u2019s acting prime minister, observed in a Nov. 13, 2006, speech that: \u201cThe timeline of the collapse of the Soviet Union can be traced to Sept. 13, 1985. On this date, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the minister of oil of Saudi Arabia, declared that the monarchy had decided to alter its oil policy radically. The Saudis stopped protecting oil prices. ... During the next six months, oil production in Saudi Arabia increased fourfold, while oil prices collapsed. ... The Soviet Union lost approximately $20 billion per year, money without which the country simply could not survive.\u201dNeither Moscow nor Tehran will collapse tomorrow. And if oil prices fall below $70 you will see a drop in U.S. production, as some exploration won\u2019t be cost effective, and prices could firm up. But have no doubt, this price falloff serves U.S. and Saudi strategic interests and it harms Russia and Iran. Oil export revenues account for about 60 percent of Iran\u2019s government revenues and more than half of Russia\u2019s.This\u00a0resource abundance comes at a time\u00a0when we\u2019ve also hit a \u201cgusher\u201d of energy technology in Silicon Valley, which is supplying us with unprecedented gains in energy efficiency and productivity, savings that may become as impactful as shale in determining our energy security and global strength.\u00a0Google, through Nest, and Apple through coding in the iPhone software, are making it easier for average Americans to manage and save energy at home or work. Bottom line: The trend line for petro-dictators is not so good. America today has a growing advantage in what the former Assistant Energy Secretary Andy Karsner calls \u201cthe three big C\u2019s: code, crude and capital.\u201d If only we could do tax reform, and replace payroll and corporate taxes with a carbon tax, we\u2019d have a formula for resiliency and success far better than any of our adversaries.

{"Headline": " Amid Tumult, Bonds Prove Steady", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThis week\u2019s stock market drop and wild gyrations may have been wrenching for investors, but they can\u2019t really be called a surprise. After 27 months with no significant decline and with many valuation measures signaling caution, a chorus of pundits has been predicting a stock market pullback and higher volatility.But along with the turmoil, there was a surprise: On Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note hit 1.85 percent, its lowest level since May 2013, extending a yearlong Treasury bond market rally that almost no one predicted.European government bond rates are even lower. The 10-year German bund rates hit 0.715 percent this week, the lowest in at least 25 years. Ten-year Swiss government bonds fell just below a paltry 0.4 percent. Ten-year rates in Italy (2.6 percent) and Spain (2.2 percent) were only slightly higher than in the United States, which, given the relative weakness of their economies, seems incredible.The recent volatility of stocks and the unpredictability of interest rates is a potent reminder to most investors to have a diversified mix of stocks and bonds and stick to a simple asset allocation plan. \u201cWhat happened this week isn\u2019t unusual, and it isn\u2019t abnormal,\u201d said Francis Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard\u2019s investment strategy group. \u201cStocks are a high-risk, high-return asset.\u201dEven though interest rates seem pretty close to rock bottom, some bond experts are saying they could drop even further. \u201cWe\u2019ve been telling our investors for a decade, that just because bond yields are low doesn\u2019t mean the direction has to be up,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said. \u201cA lot of people confuse the level with the direction. We agree the level is low, so return expectations are low. But it\u2019s not as simple as gravity, that just because they\u2019re low means they have to go up.\u201dGiven recent strength in the United States economy, the decline in the unemployment rate and the Fed\u2019s repeated intention to tighten monetary policy over the next year, no wonder hardly anyone anticipated this year\u2019s bond market rally. But there were a few lonely voices. In his list of \u201c15 Surprises for 2014,\u201d issued in January, Douglas Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management (and a widely followed market pundit), predicted \u201cslowing global growth\u201d (surprise No. 1); \u201cstock prices decline\u201d (surprise No. 3); and \u201cbonds outperform stocks\u201d (surprise No. 4).Those have been remarkably accurate so far, though Mr. Kass readily acknowledges that he was far too bearish in 2013, when his forecasts were \u201cway off the mark.\u201d When I reached him this week at his office in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Kass said he was sticking by his predictions that stocks would end the year at their lows and that bonds would show a 10 percent return.\u201cI think we\u2019re approaching an \u2018aha\u2019 moment,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen investors realize that growth isn\u2019t going to emerge in the months ahead. The central banks have blunt tools, and they\u2019ve reached the limit of what they can do. As Peggy Lee put it, \u2018Is that all there is?\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Kass expects the bond rally to continue and is among those who suspect the Fed will delay raising rates. \u201cPeople are losing sight of the fact that the Fed hasn\u2019t raised rates since June 2006,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see them raising rates for two or three more years. That will be another surprise for the markets.\u201dCarlo Besenius, chief executive of the financial advisory firm Creative Global Investments, predicted in March that United States and European government bonds would rally, with 10-year Treasury yields falling to 1.8 percent and German bunds at 0.9 percent. Both pretty much hit their targets. Although he expects what he calls \u201ca mini-correction\u201d to intervene, he\u2019s lowering his target for the next six months even further, to 1.5 percent for Treasuries and 0.55 percent for bunds, and deduces the rally will continue.A major factor in Mr. Besenius\u2019s forecast is low inflation expectations, even the possibility of deflation in Europe. That helps explains Europe\u2019s lower rates, since the real return \u2014 the yield minus the inflation rate \u2014 reflects very low inflation expectations there. And like Mr. Kass, he says he believes the Fed will resume quantitative easing in 2015 and put off any rate increases.Unlike Mr. Kass, Mr. Besenius is optimistic about stocks, partly because low bond yields make stocks\u2019 expected returns more attractive by comparison. And low global interest rates and falling oil prices should stimulate investment and consumer spending. He sees buying opportunities emerging in the recent sell-off and is predicting a 15 percent rally from current levels by the end of the year. Investors \u201cshould be patient\u201d and \u201cbuy into high-yielding sectors like energy, financials, industrials and materials,\u201d he said. He also recommends stocks in Brazil, China and India, countries with strong fundamental growth and a potential for monetary easing.Mr. Kinniry said Vanguard had been fielding a surge of calls from investors worried about this week\u2019s volatility.

{"Headline": "Greece's Economic and Political Traps", "Date": "2014-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Five years into the Greek crisis, it is becoming increasingly difficult to hope that it will end anytime soon. Perhaps we expected too much: that the largest international bailout in history would help set the economy back on its feet within a couple of years; that we could put the problems that had brought us to the brink of bankruptcy behind us; that our political system would change, with new forces sweeping away incompetence and corruption. But it would take a revolution to overturn frameworks, mentalities and behaviors developed over decades. What we have had, instead, is a relentless devaluation at every level: Greek society has lost a great deal, and gained little in return. We are caught in two traps \u2014 economic and political \u2014 that combine to make escape seem impossible. For the past few years, Greece has been in the hole of austerity and recession. Our gross domestic product contracted by over a quarter between 2008 and 2013, with household wealth dropping by 23 percent since 2007, according to a September report produced by the Julius Baer Group. The percentage of Greeks at risk of poverty or severe deprivation has climbed to 35.7 percent, from 27.6 percent in 2009. Consequently, more and more people are falling deep into debt, with over a billion euros in nonperforming loans being added each month to the bill (of at least 75 billion euros, or over 34 percent of all loans in August). Tax debts were at \u20ac70.16 billion in September. Just as the economy\u2019s contraction has made public debt an unbearable 174.9 percent of G.D.P., the lack of credit and ever higher taxes have ravaged businesses, pushing unemployment up and keeping it high. (After six years of recession, the economy is expected to grow slightly this year.)The middle class has been devastated; it has borne the brunt of higher taxes but will not be able to do so for much longer. Apart from a small primary surplus (when loans and interest are not counted) and a surge in tourism, investments and production remain low. Greece managed to remain in the eurozone, but the longer austerity continues, the deeper the hole we\u2019re in. The political trap is even more dangerous. The \u20ac240-billion- bailout agreement with our creditors (the troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) did not consider the political and social implications of forcing major change on people while putting them under severe economic pressure. Most citizens tried to keep up but were overwhelmed, and opposition parties, particularly marginal ones on the extreme left and right, benefited from this discontent. Meanwhile, the parties in government were unable to revoke their past behavior and push through all the necessary reforms. Center-right New Democracy and center-left Pasok, in a coalition since elections in June 2012, have alternated in power for 40 years, and have shouldered the blame for past policies and also for the current, troika-mandated ones. With 155 seats in the 300-seat Parliament, the two have little room to maneuver between the demands of Greece\u2019s creditors and the political cost of further change. Now they have to face their greatest challenge: President Karolos Papoulias\u2019s second five-year term ends in March and the Constitution demands that a president is elected by at least 180 members of Parliament. Failing this, national elections must be held. Opposition parties have said they will back no candidate proposed by the coalition. If the government cannot marshal enough votes from the Parliament\u2019s 23 independents, and get others to break ranks, elections will have to be held by March. This prospect prompted Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s failed bid earlier this month to show that Greece no longer needed supervision and could return to the markets for financing. The Athens Stock Exchange index lost 13.57 percent in three days, while interest on 10-year bonds shot above 9 percent \u2014 a result of a lack of faith that Greece can stand on its own, and of the prospect of early elections\u2019 creating further instability. Concerns over the health of the eurozone as a whole, with tension among Germany, France and Italy over Berlin\u2019s insistence on austerity, have not helped Greece\u2019s cause or comforted citizens that the course we have followed is the right one. Opinion polls \u2014 as well as the results of last May\u2019s elections for the European Parliament \u2014 suggest that the radical left-wing party Syriza could win elections but would struggle to forge a coalition. Even if a new round of elections was avoided, a Syriza-led government could waste a lot of time before it got to work; Syriza is a coalition of several fractious groups that may find it difficult to settle on a policy with junior parties that will leverage their support to their greatest benefit. Pressing problems and the fulfillment of promises to undo many of the government\u2019s policies could be on the back burner for a while. Before the elections, New Democracy and Pasok will focus on the instability that could follow a Syriza victory, while Syriza will try to block any progress before the election. Either way, the economy pays the cost.More insidious than the economic and political logjam is the people\u2019s feeling of futility and anger. The opposition claims that the government, at the behest of foreigners, has destroyed the country, while the government charges that the opposition\u2019s populist promises and close ties to unions will undo all that was achieved.Courts overrule laws ordering judges\u2019 pay cuts while taxpayers are squeezed further; judicial officials and opposition parties complain that the government passes laws absolving people of past crimes, while others say this is to protect officials from unfair prosecution; desperate people work for little pay and no social security, often in jobs well below their level of expertise. In the confusion, what citizens see is that special interest groups are still in a position to influence policy at the expense of everyone else. This sense of injustice is the greatest punishment of all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed at the Crossroads ", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBarring unexpected bad economic news in the next several days, the Federal Reserve will finish its bond-buying program at the end of this month. In all, the program has pumped $3.5 trillion into the economy since 2008, helping to revive financial markets and stabilize the economy. Now comes the hard part. Politically, however, the decision is fraught. The Fed is not supposed to be swayed by elected officials or special interests. But bond holders \u2014 a powerful political constituency that includes financial firms, investment funds and wealthy individuals \u2014 generally want the Fed to raise rates sooner rather than later, and they have ample opportunity to dominate public discourse. Their aim is to pre-emptively attack inflation, which diminishes the value of their bonds. But it is not the Fed\u2019s job to protect investors\u2019 bond portfolios. Its job is to foster both stable inflation and full employment. With the American economy still operating below par, low interest rates would pose an inflation threat only after they had succeeded in spurring credit, strong growth and robust employment. Since those results have not yet been achieved, there is no inflationary pressure and no reason to raise rates in the near term. In fact, inflation has been so low for so long that the economy would not be in danger of overheating even if there were a period of inflation above the 2 percent target. That target is an average that the Fed would like to maintain over time, not a level that necessarily signals the need for a rate increase. Similarly, wages can rise at a rate well above inflation without pushing up prices. That\u2019s because wage increases do not even begin to pose an inflation threat until they exceed the rate of inflation plus the rate of labor-productivity growth, roughly 3.5 percent currently. Fed officials have indicated that they plan to start raising rates in mid-2015. They have stuck to that timetable, even as wage-and-price increases have failed to materialize. That policy consistency is understandable on one level: With many months to go before it has to either raise rates or admit that the economy is too weak to warrant an increase, the Fed rightly wants to project optimism.It is crucial, however, for the Fed to keep rates low as long as inflation is in check. If rates are raised too soon, growth would be slowed before pay raises and adequate credit are restored to workers and consumers. If that happens, the Fed effort to rescue the economy would, in the end, only further entrench inequality. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawmakers Grill French Candidate for European Economic Post", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The French candidate for one of Europe\u2019s top economic jobs faced a barrage of criticism during his confirmation hearing on Thursday, as some members of the European Parliament accused him of failing to push necessary reforms in his home country and said he could not be trusted to apply budgetary rules fairly in the European Union.The grilling of Pierre Moscovici, a Socialist who was the French finance minister until this year, was a sign of deepening concern that, if confirmed, he might use a double standard. His critics fear that France might be given leniency in meeting deficit targets while other countries continue to struggle after years of painful austerity in trying to meet budgetary targets.France, the skeptical Parliament members indicated, had not gone far enough in putting economic reforms into effect \u2014 like making its employment law more flexible, opening sectors of its economy to more competition and reducing public spending.\u201cDo you really think that you, personally, are the best man for this job considering the fact that your track record on implementing structural reforms has been so terribly disappointing?\u201d said Cora van Nieuwenhuizen, a conservative Dutch lawmaker, generating applause.\u201cThe French government announced that no further effort will be demanded of the French, and this is my biggest concern,\u201d said Esther de Lange, another conservative Dutch lawmaker. \u201cHow are you going to explain to the Greeks, to the Portuguese, to the Irish, even to the Dutch, that they had to take measures and that the French don\u2019t?\u201d she asked.During his three-hour hearing Thursday morning, Mr. Moscovici, the nominee for the post of commissioner for fiscal and monetary policy, sought to convince the Parliament\u2019s influential Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee that he would be evenhanded in the way he applied the rules. \u201cI am French, I am a Social Democrat,\u201d he said, but \u201cI am not going to use my role to be the ambassador for one country or for one party.\u201dMr. Moscovici also drew criticism from British lawmakers. Their country does not have the euro as its currency but it is subject to European Union debt and deficit rules, and it has a strong interest in a prosperous and stable Continental economy.\u201cNot looking forward to Moscovici\u2019s \u2018over creative interpretation of the rules\u2019 \u2014 isn\u2019t that what caused the EZ crisis?\u201d Kay Swinburne, a British lawmaker with the Conservative Party, wrote on Twitter, referring to the eurozone crisis.Mr. Moscovici did, however, win some plaudits. Sven Giegold, a German lawmaker and member of the Greens, said that Mr. Moscovici \u201cshould be given a chance as commissioner for economic and monetary affairs\u201d because the Frenchman was \u201ca convinced pro-European.\u201d Among the nominees available to do the job, \u201conly he would be able to achieve a balance\u201d between spending and economic rigor, Mr. Giegold said.The new European Parliament was elected in May, and many of its lawmakers campaigned to make European institutions like the European Commission far more responsive to public demands for jobs and growth. So far, the confirmation hearings have indicated that lawmakers are going to aggressively vet and challenge some of the candidates selected by Jean-Claude Juncker, the new president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.Parliament does not have the power to reject individual candidates, but must instead approve or reject the entire slate of 27 nominees; the vocal resistance to Mr. Moscovici suggested that the review process could be highly politicized. Jonathan Hill, the British Conservative nominee to become the commissioner overseeing financial markets, faced some tough questions in his hearing on Wednesday about his suitability for the job, and was asked by left-leaning lawmakers to face a second hearing next week.Mr. Hill\u2019s humor appeared to win over many lawmakers on Wednesday. But he disappointed others by not providing many details about how he would oversee the creation of a so-called capital markets union \u2014 a plan backed by Mr. Juncker to develop sources of financing other than banks \u2014 or how Mr. Hill would continue reform of the banking sector.\u201cWe believe that he can be a good commissioner, but he did not entirely convince us in relation to the content and priorities of his portfolio,\u201d said Elisa Ferreira, a Socialist lawmaker from Portugal.Parliament\u2019s vote on the nominees has been scheduled for Oct. 22, just a few days before new members of the commission are meant to take office under the presidency of Mr. Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg.A rejection by the Parliament or a delay to the vote because of a stalemate over the nominees would leave the current commission, led by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, in place for an indeterminate period of time.Even as Mr. Moscovici maintained on Thursday that he would work on behalf of the entire European Union, he also appeared to be seeking to assure the French lawmakers at the hearing.\u201cThere are rules that do have to be followed,\u201d but \u201cwe can perhaps amend things, perhaps we can grant delays, perhaps to France but to other countries as well,\u201d Mr. Moscovici told Bernard Monot, a lawmaker from the French National Front. \u201cThere is an entire range of possibilities available to the commissioner.\u201dThe French budget deficit is sore topic because of the way France and other big countries, including Germany flouted the rules, known as the Stability and Growth Pact, in the decade leading up to the sovereign debt crisis that nearly destroyed the euro currency union.Since then, the pact has been reinforced by making it harder for national governments to block a recommendation by the European Commission to impose fines. Even so, the strongest sanction allowed for by the pact \u2014 a fine of up to 0.2 percent of a country\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 has never been imposed, because of what budget disciplinarians see as a lack of political will.For France, which made its \u201cno austerity\u2019' proclamation in proposing its 2015 budget on Wednesday, the next stage is for the European Commission to assess that budget, which Paris must submit for scrutiny by Oct. 15.Even if the commission concludes that France is breaking the rules, it would give Paris time to submit a revised budget, and could even grant further extensions before ultimately recommending a fine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indians Adoring Modi From Afar", "Date": "2014-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From IndiaNEW DELHI \u2014 In Madison Square Garden in New York on Sunday, about 20,000 people, most of them aligned with the Democratic Party, gathered to proclaim their love for a man whom the Republicans might have claimed as their own.The Hindu diaspora that had come to cheer the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, wants the United States to be liberal, respectful of religious minorities and generous to immigrants, but its members back a different set of political values in the country where they were born. Values that triumphed with the ascent of Mr. Modi, whom the Indian stock market adores, who complained in March that his political rivals were killing rhinos to make room for Bangladeshi migrants, who has shown disdain for government spending on the poor and whom human rights advocates hold responsible for the slaughter of hundreds of Muslims in 2002, as did the American government, which barred him from entering the United States until a few months ago, when he became prime minister.Over the years, Mr. Modi has rehabilitated himself from a man accused of crimes against humanity to a leader who can influence the Indian economy through the myths of his personality. In that process, he has given the rabid and the sane and humane a few honorable reasons to love him. His audience in Madison Square Garden was so besotted with him that, even though his speech was unremarkable and contained the daft alliterations for which he has an incurable love (\u201cDemocracy, demographic dividend and demand\u201d), they applauded almost every line. When he paused between sentences, they imagined there was a hidden joke or deep meaning, and applauded his silences too, grasping nuances where there were none. Mr. Modi appeared to enjoy his own oratory, unaware of any mishaps.Explore key developments in the 2002 riots in Gujarat that shadowed Narendra Modi\u2019s ascent to the prime minister\u2019s office.He referred to Mohandas Gandhi as Mohanlal Gandhi. A day earlier, he stood with Hugh Jackman in Central Park and quoted from a film the actor had no part in: \u201cMay the force be with you!\u201d These were minor gaffes by the standards of the man who went to Bhutan and called it Nepal. But he is so popular with those who dominate the noise on social media that he usually gets away with things that would damage the less fortunate.In the portrayal of Mr. Modi\u2019s apparent charms, there is little difference now between the predominant tone on social media and the mainstream news media, which have covered his visit to the United States with delirious optimism. Such journalistic affection for a politician is unusual anywhere in the democratic world. The owners of two leading newspapers and the editor of one told me, in their different ways, that their adoration of Mr. Modi is not because of any ideological shift, but a result of their conviction that this man can revive the economy, which greatly affects the revenues of mainstream journalism.But Mr. Modi has suffered some upsets since taking over as prime minister. His Bharatiya Janata Party has fared below expectations in some by-elections. And in the state of Maharashtra, which goes to the polls in two weeks, the local political force, Shiv Sena, has broken its 25-year alliance with Mr. Modi\u2019s party because it felt that the B.J.P.\u2019s excessive demands were disproportionate to its current popularity.The Shiv Sena, which has gained its influence by using violence against Muslims and poor migrants in Mumbai, the state capital, has for the first time decided to pick a fight with the mighty \u2014 the prosperous traders who hail from the neighboring state of Gujarat, Mr. Modi\u2019s home. Many of India\u2019s richest are Gujaratis living in Mumbai. The Shiv Sena is attempting to brand the impending political battle against Mr. Modi as a struggle of the poor against the rich who occupy the best real estate in Mumbai.The consequences of all political responses to Mr. Modi will be borne by the residents of India. Members of the diaspora have the luxury to profess love for their motherland and to finance their beloved patriarch from a comfortable distance.Advertisement"}

Born in South Korea, she was adopted by a French family when she was 6 months old. She graduated at the top of her class at the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration, the training ground for future French presidents and prime ministers. Colleagues say that before working 14-hour days as a minister, Ms. Pellerin was a prolific reader of fiction and nonfiction, and that she is equally at ease admiring a Picasso painting as she is listening to a hip-hop track.Outside France, Ms. Pellerin might receive even more sympathy. Although revered at home, Mr. Modiano, until recently, was largely unknown abroad. One of his novels, \u201cRue des Boutiques Obscures,\u201d released as \u201cMissing Person\u201d in English, won the prestigious Prix Goncourt in 1978, but has sold just 2,425 copies in the United States.Aur\u00e9lien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Refitted Race Around World, Nothing but Daring Separates the Boats", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the ArenaLong before Charlie Enright found a way to convince a Norwegian race director and a Turkish businessman that he deserved their faith and, above all, money, he was an elementary school student in East Providence, R.I.\u201cWe studied it as part of a geography class,\u201d Enright said in an interview this past week.Let the sleep deprivation begin.\u201cI try to average four and half hours every 24,\u201d said Will Oxley, Alvimedica\u2019s veteran navigator. \u201cAnd I try to do it in three 90-minute sleeps. I track it very carefully. I log my sleep, and when I can see my decision-making deteriorate I will get a little extra. It\u2019s one of the biggest challenges we face.\u201dForty years after the first edition of this race finished in Portsmouth, England, the Volvo remains quite a challenge. But it has lost much of its rough-and-ready novelty through the decades, becoming more corporate in feel and less edgy in a sports world where \u201cextreme\u201d has become an all-too-common prefix.\u201cBelieve me, the Volvo\u2019s still an adventure,\u201d Read said this past week.Read, the 53-year-old president of North Sails, is sitting out this edition, but his former North Sails employee Enright, who recently turned 30, is making his debut.Enright and his 25-year-old teammate Mark Towill, who both sailed at Brown University and hunted down the funding against the odds to compete in the Volvo, are the leaders of a new wave of talent that has changed the face of the race. And their emergence is directly linked to major change in the race itself.The original Whitbread was contested in all manner of ocean-going vessels, and teams have continued to have some latitude in boat design in subsequent class rules. But faced with a sluggish global economy, spiraling costs and increasing sponsor resistance, the Volvo has switched to a one-design class for the first time this year.That means all seven of the teams are using identical 65-foot boats that were produced in the same British shipyard.\u201cIt\u2019s truly one design, down to they are weighing everything we put on the boats to make sure some boats don\u2019t have extra stacks that provide extra stability,\u201d Oxley said. \u201cEveryone has the same software. No one is allowed to have bespoke software.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like stepping on a sophisticated Laser,\u201d he added, referring to the one-design class of dinghy.The Volvo\u2019s bold move is not without naysayers, some of whom fear that the lack of freedom will stifle the innovation that comes with teams searching for a design edge, however small.But a one-design approach is undeniably cost-efficient with the teams now able to share the same shore crew and avoid sinking funds into research and development of boats and sails.Knut Frostad, the Norwegian who is chief executive officer of the Volvo Race, said the team budgets for the last race ranged from 20 million euros to 35 million euros ( $25 million to $44 million), over a two-year period. This time, he said the budgets range from 9 million to 15 million euros. Though there is only one more team this time than in 2011, when there was a record low of six, Frostad said there could well have been no boats and no race at all.\u201cIf we had done nothing, if we had not changed, I\u2019m very confident we wouldn\u2019t have existed,\u201d Frostad said. \u201cThere were a few other changes we could have done instead, but I think this is the right thing.\u201cNow the sailors know it\u2019s about them. It\u2019s about nothing else. It\u2019s about who can keep the team together and they can still go as fast as before but there are no excuses now.\u201d\u201cIf I were still doing the race, I would miss the custom aspect of it,\u201d Read said. \u201cI loved integrating the design and sailing teams, but for the race\u2019s viability, I think one design was probably the only option, and I think they are very happy they did it.\u201dThe young Americans caught Frostad\u2019s eye in 2011. Though teams once came to the race on their own with their sponsors and backing in place, Frostad and Volvo organizers have become increasingly involved in identifying potential sponsors and connecting them with prospective sailors.Though Enright and Towill courted American companies, Frostad eventually put them in touch with Alvimedica, a Turkish medical supply manufacturer looking to raise its profile globally. The team is flying both Turkish and American flags during the race.It has been quite a learning curve, and it is only going to get steeper as the Volvo rookies head off on the longest leg of their lives and then sail for the first time in the direction of the volatile Southern Ocean.\u201cThey\u2019re going to be a lot older and wiser when they get to Sweden in nine months,\u201d Frostad said.Meanwhile, back in Rhode Island, Enright\u2019s wife Meris, a fifth-grade teacher, will be helping to organize a geography class of her own with a certain round-the-world race for a tool.\u201cShe\u2019s doing it with her kids this time around,\u201d Enright said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Campaign Road, Uneasy Democrats Show Obama Their Tail Lights", "Date": "2014-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Bracing for a difficult election in just over a week, when they could lose control of the Senate, Democrats exasperated with the White House are already moving to pin blame on President Obama, whom Republicans have made the centerpiece of the campaign.Even optimistic Democrats say they have little more than a 50-50 chance to retain their Senate majority. Senior elected officials, strategists and donors have begun to openly criticize Mr. Obama, contending that his low popularity and some ill-advised remarks have proved toxic for candidates trying to distinguish themselves from the president to appeal to swing voters.\u201cIt is all Republicans are running on,\u201d Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the national environment as it is mismanagement by the White House, real and imagined.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s loyalists argue the opposite, namely that the president could have helped increase the turnout among the coalition of young voters, women and minorities that he built during his campaigns. They fault this year\u2019s political map, heavy on races in states the president lost, as primarily responsible for Democrats\u2019 fortunes. And the president\u2019s inner circle also says that if Democrats do hold the Senate, it will be because of money the president toiled to raise and of the few states \u2014 Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina \u2014 where his campaigns invested millions to develop organizations.\u201cIf he gets blamed for some of the losses, I hope he also gets credit for developing some of the get-out-the-vote apparatus that could help save some of these seats,\u201d said David Axelrod, a political adviser to Mr. Obama.The rift represents a larger dispute about the party\u2019s future going into the 2016 presidential race. It pits strategists who believe Democrats must carve out an identity independent from Mr. Obama to win over centrist voters against those who say turning out the president\u2019s coalition is the new formula for success.For now, though, the pre-emptive recriminations have begun. Tensions are growing between the White House and the party\u2019s congressional leaders. Both sides are reluctant to air the dispute publicly, especially a week before the balloting, but some are acknowledging it exists.\u201cWe have disagreements with the White House, but we also have a lot of things we agree on,\u201d said David Krone, chief of staff for the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada.Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist, said he was puzzled over how a president who so appreciates the power of words could have been so careless.\u201cThis is Politics 101: Always make it about the voters, not about yourself,\u201d Mr. Begala said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it. It was an unforced error at a time we can ill afford them.\u201dEven some of the president\u2019s closest associates were troubled that the address he delivered at Northwestern University this month was a statistics-laden argument about how the economy had improved rather than a jeremiad against Republican policies that could frame the election.\u201cYou can tell I\u2019m out of practice,\u201d he told the crowd of more than 6,000.Backstage, he told Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and a longtime ally, \u201cI\u2019ve got to do this more, get back into fighting shape.\u201dHe is scheduled to attend a handful of campaign rallies between now and Election Day, for candidates for governor in Wisconsin, Maine, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Michigan, where he will also campaign in a Senate race that national Republicans are no longer contesting.Mr. Obama is resigned to the diminished role, his allies say.\u201cHere\u2019s the reality \u2014 he knows it, we know it \u2014 and that is that off-year elections are historically not kind to incumbent presidents,\u201d Mr. Durbin said.To some Democratic operatives, the White House detachment and belief that Mr. Obama\u2019s presence in the race could offer a significant boost with the party base is all too reminiscent of the last election featuring an unpopular president in his sixth year.\u201cThe same thing was happening in 2006,\u201d said Ben Barnes, a Democratic donor, likening President George W. Bush\u2019s attention to foreign affairs to Mr. Obama\u2019s focus on issues such as the Islamic State and Ebola. \u201cEverybody said Bush was ignoring the domestic front and the only thing he was focused on was Iraq.\u201dAnd, Mr. Barnes added, \u201cRepublicans were very nervous.\u201dJust as it did six years ago, that anxiety has partly manifested itself in pleas to keep the president out of the most competitive states. In one remarkable instance of political history\u2019s repeating itself, former Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, who is running to regain the job as a Democrat, is now avoiding an appearance with Mr. Obama just as he did with Mr. Bush in the final days of the 2006 election when running as a Republican.In some ways, though, Mr. Obama\u2019s treatment by his own party has been even harsher, with a few candidates refusing to acknowledge whether they voted for him. Former President Bill Clinton has even devised a refrain emphasizing how Mr. Obama is a lame duck who will be gone when the senators running this year still have four years left on their terms.\u201cThe cuts seem unkinder now than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d said Jeff Shesol, a Democratic speechwriter.If the language is barbed, it is because Democrats are uneasy. \u201cEverybody is concerned,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said. \u201cVoters are unhappy with the president, but they are even more unhappy with Republicans in Congress.\u201dDemocratic candidates, by distancing themselves from Mr. Obama, are responding to the political marketplace, party strategists say. \u201cThe public has forgotten \u2014 and this is not Iowa-specific but includes Iowa \u2014 the love affair it had with President Obama and the mess he inherited,\u201d said Jerry Crawford, an Iowa Democratic activist.And Republicans, putting aside their differences, have relentlessly sought to make Mr. Obama the defining issue of the campaign.\u201cEvery Republican is running against Obama,\u201d said Mr. Beebe, adding with a touch of amazement: \u201cThey\u2019re talking about guys that were mayors who helped Obama as mayors.\u201dFormer Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, recalled a conversation with a Republican official in his home state who said the party\u2019s campaign against Senator Mary L. Landrieu could be captured in two words: \u201cObama bad.\u201d\u201cWell, every single Senate candidate we have you can summarize the race by saying: \u2018Obama bad,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Breaux said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attacks in West Raise New Fears Over ISIS\u2019 Influence", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisAnd in New York City, a man wielding a hatchet attacks four police officers in Queens, slashing one in the head and another in the arm.The series of episodes over just the last four weeks is raising new fears about the capacity of the extremists who call themselves the Islamic State to catalyze so-called lone-wolf attacks, conceived and carried out by individuals or small groups around the Western world who may have little or no connection to the Islamic State.There is no evidence that any of the episodes were carried out by any centrally organized terror network. But in each case the violence was plotted or executed by individuals moved by the messages of Islamist extremists, and all took place in the one month since the Islamic State began exhorting Muslims in the West to commit such acts.\u201cThe Al Qaeda \u2018fan boys\u2019 never did this, definitely not in so coordinated a fashion in so close a time,\u201d said William McCants, a scholar of Islamist militancy at the Brookings Institution.Decades of Qaeda calls for Muslims in the West to instigate their own attacks mostly \u201cfell on deaf ears,\u201d but \u201cthe ISIS guys are just really energized,\u201d Mr. McCants said, using an alternate name for the group, the Islamic State.Analysts say the far-flung plots and attacks mark a change in the nature of the group and its threat to the West. Unlike Al Qaeda or other jihadist groups, the Islamic State had previously focused on capturing territory across Syria and Iraq and on sectarian killings in its own region \u2014 not on a global war against the West. But since the American-led bombing campaign against the group began to hit its Syrian stronghold, the Islamic State has sought to retaliate by urging its sympathizers throughout the West to strike back on its behalf.The group\u2019s social media messages to Muslims living in the West have changed sharply, from \u201ccome join the attack\u201d to \u201cwe are being attacked and what are you doing? You are just sitting there!\u201d said Mokhtar Awad, a researcher at the liberal Center for American Progress, based in Washington.Now, the swift responses in Canada and elsewhere suggest that its unique combination of spectacular violence, media-savvy messaging and sheer braggadocio may enable the Islamic State to bring about lone-wolf attacks like the assault on the Canadian Parliament even without building an international network or organization. If it inspires more, they would pose a diffuse and pervasive threat that Al Qaeda could only dream of.The Canadian attacks have already cast a different light on the proliferation of measures by countries around the world to stop their citizens from traveling to Syria and Iraq to join the fight for fear that they might return to pose threats at home.The Islamic State, though, has little support from the militant thinkers and ideologues who have helped recruit for Al Qaeda\u2019s war on the West. Nearly all dispute the Islamic State\u2019s claim that its caliphate should rule all Muslims as well as the priority it places on killing Muslim dissenters.Instead of relying on religious or political arguments, the Islamic State has capitalized on the inspirational power of its violence and territorial gains.\u201cThe traditional sheikhs of Al Qaeda can talk, talk, talk, but the consumer does not have to listen,\u201d said Mr. Awad of the Center for American Progress. But the Islamic State is exploiting the propaganda of actions, not words, he said, and it is proving more effective.Sympathizers across the Muslim world still identify the Islamic State primarily with its emphasis on prioritizing regional, intra-Arab struggle. In recent conversations with young supporters in Tunis \u2014 capital of the country that has sent many young men to join the Islamic State \u2014 many said its only difference from Al Qaeda was over the tactical question of whether to take on the West now or later, after building what the terrorist group considers a pure caliphate.The Islamic State\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, wants to take on \u201cthe bad Arabs first,\u201d Sufian Abbas, 31, a student sitting at a street cafe in Tunis, said sympathetically.That changed on Sept. 21, as the American-led bombing campaign escalated. In an audio statement over the Internet, the militant group\u2019s official spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, urged Muslims living in the West to retaliate against their countries for joining the strikes.\u201cIf you can kill a disbelieving American or European \u2014 especially the spiteful and filthy French \u2014 or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be,\u201d Mr. Adnani urged, adding, \u201cKill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military\u201d because \u201cboth of them are disbelievers.\u201dHe warned Americans and Europeans that they would suffer.\u201cYou will pay the price when your economies collapse,\u201d he declared. \u201cYou will pay the price when your sons are sent to wage war against us, and they return to you as disabled amputees, or inside coffins, or mentally ill. You will pay the price as you are afraid of traveling to any land. You will pay the price as you walk on your streets, turning right and left, fearing the Muslims. You will not feel secure even in your bedrooms.\u201dAnalysts said they had never heard anything like it before from the group. \u201cIt was the first time that they really crossed the Rubicon into attacks that are out of the area,\u201d whether in terms of inspiring or organizing them, said Brian Fishman, a researcher on counterterrorism at the New America Foundation. \u201cIt was pretty dramatic.\u201dIn the aftermath of the Western attacks, he said, the Islamic State wanted to put pressure on its foes just as any other nation might seek to deter or punish aggression against it. \u201cInciting random individuals to do lone-wolf attacks targeting civilians or off-duty military folk is clearly terrorism,\u201d Mr. Fishman said, \u201cbut they are thinking about this as a strategic response to pressure we are applying on them in the Middle East.\u201dMany predicted just such a backlash of terrorist violence against the West after the airstrikes, Mr. Fishman said. But he argued that in any case it was just a matter of time before the militant group turned its attacks in that direction.\u201cThere is just so much momentum in the jihadi community to take the violence to the West,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the victims of a motorist\u2019s assault in Canada.

Last week, with sanctions and dropping oil prices choking Russia\u2019s economy and stoking Mr. Putin\u2019s anger, the predictable target was his b\u00eate noire, America.\u201cIt looks like the so-called \u2018winners\u2019 of the Cold War are determined to have it all and reshape the world into a place that could better serve their interests alone\u201d went one notable riff. \u201cThis is the behavior of the nouveau riche, who stumbled upon a great wealth \u2014 global leadership. Instead of managing it expertly and accurately, for their own benefit as well, they made a lot of blunders.\u201dWhat was not clear, however, was whether the Russian president was speaking to the foreigners or to the home audience, to which his act was televised. Accusing the United States of taking advantage of a \u201cunipolar world\u201d and meddling in all corners of the world has been his line since his first major blast at the United States at the 2007 Munich Conference on Security Policy.But the further his standing has sunk in the West, most precipitously over the crisis in Ukraine, and the more he has talked tough to the United States, the higher his popularity has soared at home. Of late, his ratings have hovered in the high 80s. What is hard to gauge listening to Mr. Putin is whether he really means to put the blame for all things wrong on the United States, or whether he is cynically using the old Soviet gimmick of projecting onto America and the West all the faults of which the U.S.S.R. itself was accused. In Mr. Putin\u2019s version of the Ukrainian crisis, for example, the United States was the instigator of the protests in Kiev that led to a \u201ccoup\u201d against President Viktor Yanukovych and the subsequent fighting. One American participant told Mr. Putin she was hard put to recognize her country as the one he was describing.What Mr. Putin clearly did believe, and what seemed most strongly to feed his rage, was that the United States refused to show him the respect he saw as his due as the leader of Russia, and Russia\u2019s due by virtue of its might, expanse and history. On Ukraine, on Syria, and on other crises, he insisted, Russia\u2019s sole interest was that \u201cour position would also be taken into account, that we be treated with respect.\u201d Several times more the word \u201cuvazhenie,\u201d respect, came up.That is undoubtedly one source of the popularity Mr. Putin has achieved at home. Of course, it is not unusual for citizens of a state to rally around their leader when under attack. But Russia\u2019s historic suspicion of the West has fed a high sensitivity to foreign opinion, even among those who strongly disagree with their rulers.Projecting Russia\u2019s sins onto the United States is an effective way of reassuring Russians that Western sanctions and accusations are hypocrisy, that Russia is not the pariah it is made out to be, and that the man in charge will not allow Russia to be trampled.How long it can work is another question. Mr. Putin\u2019s current term as president doesn\u2019t run out until 2018, and he could go for another six-year term after that. But that is a long way off, and popularity is notoriously fickle in politics. The Russian economy was in the doldrums even before sanctions and sagging oil prices, and the Ukraine conflict shows no sign of ending soon. Bashing Washington can only go so far.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Given Choice, Parents Pick Cheaper Medical Procedure for Children", "Date": "2014-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPaying Till It HurtsAn appendix can be removed in two ways: via open surgery or using a laparoscope, in which the inflamed organ is removed with the aid of a fiber optic scope, with only tiny incisions. The average total cost of the traditional open surgery is about $2,000 less, said Dr. Eric Scaife, of the University of Utah Health Sciences, who helped conduct the study.Though American surgeons almost always favor the minimally invasive procedure, the results of the two types of procedures are similar in children, studies show. \u201cCost is really the only difference \u2014 there\u2019s no difference in outcome,\u201d Dr. Scaife noted in a telephone interview.When told that and given the price quotes, nearly two-thirds of the parents selected the cheaper open procedure. Parents given price information were 1.8 times as likely to choose the cheaper option than others. In fact, 31 percent of parents given the information said it had been a primary influence in their decision. And 90 percent said they liked having a choice.The study offers a compelling case for price transparency combined with medical consumerism as one strategy that could help reel in the nation\u2019s $2.8 trillion health care bill. The study results suggested that parents tended to choose the cheaper option regardless of their insurance or economic situation, Dr. Scaife said.The minimally invasive approach leaves a somewhat smaller scar and is better for overweight children, Dr. Scaife said. But in lean children there is no difference in infection rates, length of stay in the hospital or the length of time before the child returns to normal activities. (Adults do take longer to rebound from the open, traditional appendectomies, he said.)A minimally invasive appendectomy is more expensive than open surgery because it requires the use of special instruments, which are often disposable, like $1,500 harmonic scalpels and special staplers that can seal off the appendix stump with one clip.Open surgery uses age-old tools like needles and thread, scalpels and metal retractors, which are sterilized and reused. (As a side note, when doctors at the University of Utah understood the magnitude of the price difference, they found ways to purchase cheaper instruments for laparoscopic surgery as well, reducing the cost gap somewhat.)Dr. Scaife said one lesson for him is that doctors should tell patients the price of procedures, and hospitals should inform doctors of the amount they are charging for their services, which are often billed separately. He said the information from the hospital could be surprisingly hard for even surgeons to obtain because hospitals consider their price lists proprietary.\u201cImagine I\u2019m in clinic and I tell a parent I\u2019m going to fix a child\u2019s hernia, and they ask, \u2018How much is it going to cost?' And I have to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u200a\u201d Dr. Scaife said. \u201cThat\u2019s very strange, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHe added, \u201cMedicine is often regarded as this magical part of our economy where patients can\u2019t make any choices.\u201d But they can, and that can help hold down costs, he said, noting, \u201cWith a bit of information, I can choose my cellphone even though I don\u2019t understand how it works.\u201dThe Upshot provides news, analy-\nsis and graphics about politics,\npolicy and everyday life. \nnytimes.com/upshotAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank Clients Might Be Unfairly Denied Accounts", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyA federal consumer watchdog is stepping up scrutiny of the screening practices banks use to decide who gets to open a checking account, with an eye toward removing barriers some would-be customers face.Most banks use special consumer data services, like ChexSystems, to evaluate applicants for checking accounts. The services track whether you have had an account closed for bouncing checks or failing to cover overdrafts or for fraudulent activity. When you apply for a new account, the bank checks your file or a score based on the file. If the bank doesn\u2019t like what it finds, you don\u2019t get the account.The reports function as a sort of blacklist, in that it is very difficult for someone to open a mainstream bank account if their report contains negative information.As with other consumer reports, however \u2014 like credit reports, which are used to assess whether a borrower is likely to repay a loan \u2014 banks weigh the information differently, and there may be errors in the data. \u201cWe are concerned about whether this information contains too many imperfections and inconsistencies,\u201d said Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in prepared remarks at a forum on Wednesday in Washington, on checking account access.Further, he said, banks may vary in the way they respond to overdrawn accounts and in the way they report information to the screeners. Some banks close accounts after just 30 days, while others may wait 120 days. Some may report unpaid amounts over $50 to screening services, while others set the threshold at $120.The bureau, he said, seeks \u201cbetter and more informed screening decisions that are fairer to consumers.\u201dStuart Pratt, president of the Consumer Data Industry Association, whose members include bank account screening companies, defended the overall accuracy of screening data, saying that \u201cdispute rates are low.\u201dChexSystems, in an emailed statement, said in part that the company \u201cseeks to receive and provide accurate information to banks to enable a client bank to decide whether it wants to accept a particular consumer as a bank customer. ChexSystems does not make account opening decisions for its client banks.\u201dChi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center, said reporting formats could be vague, leading some banks to reject applicants because the customer\u2019s record indicated that a previous account was closed because of fraud, even though the customer was the victim of fraud, not the perpetrator. Often, banks close accounts citing \u201cabuse,\u201d but what that means is not always clear.The C.F.P.B. estimates that 6 percent of checking accounts are closed involuntarily. Those customers, Ms. Wu said, \u201clikely can\u2019t get another account.\u201dAfter consumers are barred from the mainstream banking world, they often fall into the \u201ccash economy,\u201d where they rely on check-cashing services and are vulnerable to having their money lost or stolen, said Susan Weinstock, director of consumer banking at the Pew Charitable Trusts. \u201cBeing banked gives consumers a lot of benefits,\u201d she said.Here are some questions about bank account screening:You also can request a free copy of your report annually by contacting the screening firm.Information reported by banks typically remains on your report for five years. If you pay the amount owed, the bank is supposed to update its report, but it is not obligated to remove the initial, negative information.Some banks and credit unions may offer so-called second-chance accounts that are available to consumers with blemished account histories. Ms. Weinstock said possible alternatives for consumers barred from traditional accounts include prepaid debit cards and new mobile bank accounts like GoBank, which says it does not use data from outside agencies to evaluate applicants. Its website says consumers may apply, \u201ceven if you\u2019ve been turned down for a bank account before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Germans Are Afraid of Google", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionBERLIN \u2014 These days Germany is known for being many things: a leader in clean technology, a manufacturing powerhouse, Europe\u2019s foreign policy center. But increasingly, it seems to have taken on yet another stereotype \u2014 as a nation of Luddites.And truth be told, Germany is not a great place to be a big tech company these days. G\u00fcnther H. Oettinger, a German official and the European Union\u2019s incoming commissioner for digital economy and society, has assailed Google for having too big a presence in Europe, and speaks of \u201ccuts\u201d in the company\u2019s market power. In Berlin, Sigmar Gabriel, the vice chancellor and economics minister, is investigating whether Germany can classify Google as a vital part of the country\u2019s infrastructure, and thus make it subject to heavy state regulation. Google is often spoken of in dark terms around cafes and biergartens. People regularly call it the Octopus. Even a figure as dominant in the global economy as Mathias D\u00f6pfner, the chief executive of Springer, Germany\u2019s largest publishing house, said he was \u201cafraid of Google.\u201d Google isn\u2019t the only target of Teutonic ire. A few weeks ago, a German court prohibited Uber from operating in the country, reasoning that the company was violating federal licensing laws for professional drivers. And Amazon is entangled in a long and wearying battle over working conditions and pay with Verdi, one of Germany\u2019s most powerful unions. To outsiders, this all seems like just another instance of collective German angst. In this view, Germany is the neurotic bystander of the digital revolution, shaken to the bone by its fear of everything new and its distrust of everything American, a secretive society still traumatized by its Stasi history, overestimating the importance of data privacy. But this caricature misses the point. Germans don\u2019t fear technology. Nor do we dislike America. On the contrary: Whenever Apple debuts a new product, our media goes bananas and people line up in front of Apple\u2019s flagship stores. Most Germans use Google and Facebook on a daily basis, without ever getting sweaty hands when typing in a search term or answering a friendship request.In politics, Silicon Valley is a magic phrase. It\u2019s what Berlin wants to be. It\u2019s where our representatives and business leaders go when they want to look really cool or snoop around for ideas. Speaking at a rollout for a new book on Silicon Valley, Mr. Gabriel\u2019s eyes turned dreamy when he told the audience how he strolled the streets of Palo Alto on his first visit there in the late \u201990s, looking around for the Hewlett-Packard garage, feeling the magic of innovation in the air. What gives? How can Germany be both afraid of and in love with technology, and the companies that make it? The key is to look beyond those things, to the corporate model they represent. The true origin of the conflict lies in the economic culture innate to those former Silicon Valley start-ups \u2014 now giants \u2014 that are taking the European markets by storm. To create and grow an enterprise like Amazon or Uber takes a certain libertarian cowboy mind-set that ignores obstacles and rules. Silicon Valley fears neither fines nor political reprimand. It invests millions in lobbying in Brussels and Berlin, but since it finds the democratic political process too slow, it keeps following its own rules in the meantime. Uber simply declared that it would keep operating in Germany, no matter what the courts ruled. Amazon is pushing German publishers to offer their books on its platform at a lower price \u2014 ignoring that, in Germany, publishers are legally required to offer their books at the same price everywhere. It is this anarchical spirit that makes Germans so neurotic. On one hand, we\u2019d love to be more like that: more daring, more aggressive. On the other hand, the force of anarchy makes Germans (and many other Europeans) shudder, and rightfully so. It\u2019s a challenge to our deeply ingrained faith in the state.The German voter-consumer will always trust the state more than he will any private company, no matter how ardently it insists on being a good guy. Trust in \u201cthe state\u201d is hard to measure; polls vary greatly depending on the current government\u2019s performance and personnel, among other factors. However, Germans regularly report much higher levels of trust in the leading state institutions \u2014 the federal legislature, the courts and the police \u2014 than Americans do. No major party, right or left, calls for shrinking the size of the state; the only party to do so, the Liberal Democrats, is too small to have a seat in the Bundestag, and is fighting for its life in state-level elections. Unlike in America, where trust in the state tends to dip during hard times, in Germany it rises. When problems appear, we look to \u201cVater Staat\u201d \u2014 the Father State \u2014 to protect us. That includes challenges by \u201cdisruptive\u201d business models, like those coming out of Silicon Valley. Indeed, the reason politicians like Mr. Gabriel \u2014 who has said \u201cwe must tame Silicon Valley capitalism\u201d\u2014 go after Amazon and Uber is that it is a surefire way to get votes. Even politicians who are normally pro-deregulation, like Mr. Oettinger, know it\u2019s smart to come down hard on tech companies. If it wants to succeed here, Silicon Valley needs to comply with the particularities of the German and European market. We love technology, but we want it delivered on our terms. In Germany, cowboys should remain in the movies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zephyr Teachout\u2019s \u2018Corruption in America\u2019", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The language of political corruption is the default invective of our jaded age. For all our disposition to believe the worst, however, Beltway knavery has only rarely been the object of sustained historical consideration. Most corruption writing, for reasons of journalistic necessity, focuses on particular scandals or individual rogues. TV shows on the subject, meanwhile, assure us that vice is simply a Washington constant; that it saunters along the streets of the capital today with the same easy, untroubled gait as it always has. The true student of misgovernment knows that the story is grander and more complicated than that. Washington isn\u2019t simply a Place of Wickedness, throbbing with sin at all times and always in the same way. The misdeeds of Iran-contra did not much resemble the turpitude of, say, the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier episode, even if they did have a great deal in common with the screw-ups of the George W. Bush years. And so the most ambitious chronicler of political misbehavior looks for something higher: a theory, a dialectic, a telos of scandal.Surprisingly few have been able to pull this off. There was the muckraker Lincoln Steffens, who called himself a \u201cgraft philosopher\u201d as he traveled from city to city studying political machines at the turn of the last century. There was the historian Matthew Josephson, whose 1938 masterpiece, \u201cThe Politicos,\u201d traced the marriage of money with politics from its dalliances during the Grant administration until its final, grotesque consummation in William McKinley\u2019s electoral triumph of 1896. And now comes Zephyr Teachout, a professor at Fordham University Law School and a candidate in this year\u2019s Democratic primary for governor of New York. Her entry into the field, \u201cCorruption in America,\u201d includes plenty of the juicy stories that make the genre so much fun to read. We learn, for example, about a diamond-studded snuffbox that Louis XVI gave Benjamin Franklin, then our ambassador to France, and how the Revolutionary generation regarded this gift \u2014 the result of a noncontroversial custom in Europe \u2014 as a possible threat to republican virtue. We read about an officer of the Turkish government in the 1870s who agreed to sell the products of an American arms manufacturer to his government in exchange for a small consideration, and who then, having duly moved the units, went to court to have the deal enforced. Good stuff, all of it. You have probably heard pundits say we are living in an age of \u201clegalized bribery\u201d; \u201cCorruption in America\u201d is the book that makes their case in careful detail. As you might have guessed, Teachout\u2019s main target is the currently reigning money-in-politics doctrine of the Supreme Court, as defined mainly by Citizens United, the 2010 decision that struck down certain restrictions on political spending by corporations. Today\u2019s court understands \u201ccorruption\u201d as a remarkably rare malady, a straight-up exchange of money for official acts. Any definition broader than that, the justices say, transgresses the all-important First Amendment. Besides, as Justice Anthony Kennedy announced in the Citizens United decision, the court now knows that \u201cindependent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption\u201d \u2014 a statement that I guess makes sense somehow in law-land but sounds to the layman\u2019s ear like the patter of a man who has come unzipped from reality. The first few American generations, Teachout reminds us, saw things very differently; for them, corruption was a \u201cnational fixation.\u201d Drawing on Montesquieu and their understanding of ancient history, the founders fretted about the countless ways a republic might be undone from within. \u201cThey saw their task this way,\u201d Teachout writes: \u201cHow could they create a system that would be most likely to be filled with men of civic virtue but avoid creating temptations that might corrode that virtue?\u201d Their answer was to build structural barriers keeping public and personal interests separated, without getting lost in considerations of whether a forbidden activity did or did not amount to what our current court calls a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d The dings and the dents in their grand design started appearing almost immediately. In 1795, it was discovered that members of the Georgia Legislature had been bribed to hand over enormous stretches of land to speculators. The guilty were promptly booted from office, but then things got complicated. Was it possible for a state to take back land that a corrupt but duly elected legislature had given away? The Supreme Court eventually decided it wasn\u2019t \u2014 corruption was just too hard to define. And so have the debates gone, right down to our own day. We think of all the laws passed over the years to restrict money in politics \u2014 and of all the ways the money has flowed under and around those restrictions. And finally, it seems to me, we just gave up out of sheer exhaustion. According to Teachout, however, it\u2019s much worse than this. Our current Supreme Court, in Citizens United, \u201ctook that which had been named corrupt for over 200 years\u201d \u2014 which is to say, gifts to politicians \u2014 \u201cand renamed it legitimate.\u201d Teachout does not exaggerate. Here is Justice Kennedy again, in the Citizens United decision: \u201cThe censorship we now confront is vast in its reach. The government has \u2018muffle[d] the voices that best represent the most significant segments of the economy.\u2019 \u201d Let me pause here to take note of another recurring peculiarity in corruption literature: an eerie overlap between theory and practice. If you go back to that \u201ccensorship\u201d quotation from Kennedy, you will notice he quotes someone else: his colleague Antonin Scalia, in an opinion from 2003. Google the quote and one place you\u2019ll find it is in a book of Scalia\u2019s opinions that was edited in 2004 by none other than the lobbyist Kevin Ring, an associate of Jack Abramoff who would later be convicted of corrupting public officials.As it happens, Teachout gives us a long and savory chapter on the legal history of lobbying. Once upon a time, lobbying was regarded as obviously perfidious; in California it was a felony; and contracts to lobby were regarded as reprehensible by the Supreme Court. Here is a justice of that body in the year 1854, delivering the court\u2019s decision in a case concerning lobbyists and lobbying contracts:Well, folks, it happened all right, just as predicted. State governments subject to wealthy corporations? Check. Speculators in legislation, infesting the capital? They call it K Street. And that fancy Latin remark about Rome? They do say that of us today. Just turn on your TV sometime and let the cynicism flow.And all of it has happened, Teachout admonishes, because the founders\u2019 understanding of corruption has been methodically taken apart by a Supreme Court that cynically pretends to worship the founders\u2019 every word. \u201cWe could lose our democracy in the process,\u201d Teachout warns, a bit of hyperbole that maybe it\u2019s time to start taking seriously.

So far, 23 states have declined to do so.At its most basic level, the Affordable Care Act was intended to reduce the number of Americans without health insurance. Measured against that goal, it has made considerable progress.A perfect measurement of the numbers of people affected by the law is still difficult, but a series of private sector surveys and a government report reach the same basic estimates: The number of Americans without health insurance has been reduced by about 25 percent this year \u2014 or eight million to 11 million people.Of that total, it appears that more than half of people who are newly insured signed up for Medicaid, especially in the states that opted to broaden eligibility for the program to low-income residents.

But consumers will need to shop around to keep their costs down.Insurers are expected to continue trying to control costs by restricting consumers from using doctors out of their network.The goal is right there in the name: the Affordable Care Act. When President Obama signed the measure in 2010, he pledged that it would protect Americans from ruinously high medical bills by guaranteeing them access to comprehensive \u2014 and affordable \u2014 coverage. For millions of people who gained insurance through the law, this has proved true.About 7.3 million people, including many who might otherwise be shut out of the market because of costly medical conditions, remain enrolled in private coverage through the law\u2019s online marketplaces. Eighty-five percent of those who signed up during the enrollment period qualified for federal subsidies to help pay premiums. For those who qualified for subsidies through the federal exchange, the subsidies lowered the cost by 76 percent on average, according to the Obama administration.But the law \u2014 by requiring insurers to provide a broader array of benefits and to cover people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 caused premiums to rise for some who already had insurance. Many of those people were young and in good health, had plans that offered sharply limited benefits that were canceled because of the law, or were not eligible for subsidies.For now, dire warnings that the law would cause premiums for most people to rise sharply have proved unfounded. The law has spurred competition, with new companies entering the market. And early indications are that premium increases next year will be relatively modest. One analysis of early regulatory filings by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform found that insurers are proposing a median increase of 4 percent in 21 states for silver plans, although people should consider switching plans to find the lowest price.Another McKinsey analysis found that in 43 states that have released information, there has been a 22 percent increase in the number of insurers for 2015. Many of the new insurers are in markets where competition was already flourishing. But it also appears there will be fewer places with little or no competition: In 21 states, McKinsey found, the number of markets with just one or two carriers fell to 10, from 41.How premiums will change in 21 statesHow premiums will change in 21 statesNote: Premium changes are shown for a 40-year-old, before tax subsidies.Source: McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System ReformBut for some consumers who bought plans with affordable premiums, high deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs have discouraged them from seeking care. Another major question is whether insurers, in trying to keep costs down, have been too restrictive about allowing consumers to use doctors outside their company\u2019s network.In New York, New Jersey and Georgia, the vast majority of exchange plans allow only in-network care. Nationally, roughly half of the plans offered through Healthcare.gov, the federal exchange, are either health maintenance organizations or exclusive provider organizations, which do not allow their customers to go out of network, except in emergencies or through an often arduous appeals process.The limited selection has helped keep premiums down, but also made \u201csurprise balance billing\u201d \u2014 or high bills that are not covered \u2014 more likely, experts say. New York recently passed a law to prevent such billings.There are also wide variations in prices within states, as insurers pursue different strategies and struggle to determine how much they need to charge to cover their costs. Someone in Dalton, Ga., for example, will see the cost of a midlevel silver plan from WellPoint\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield decline by 12 percent, according to 2015 rate filings. But in Dublin, Ga., three and a half hours away, a person who bought a silver plan from Humana could see the price rise by nearly a third.With such variability, it is hard to know who will find the plans unaffordable this time around. For now, the evidence suggests that middle-income people who don\u2019t qualify for subsidies, or who qualify only for small ones, are most likely to struggle with the cost. In a Commonwealth Fund survey conducted this spring, 44 percent of adults with incomes above 250 percent of the poverty level, or $29,175 for individuals, found it difficult to pay their premiums for marketplace plans, compared with 33 percent of those with incomes below that level.For that reason, experts say it is critical that consumers shop around when enrollment begins on Nov. 15, since their current insurer may be raising rates even as other companies lower theirs.In places where the law is already achieving its goal of fostering additional competition \u2014 Maine, for instance \u2014 consumers appear to be less likely to feel \u201crate shock,\u201d where premiums go up by double digits. But in states where there is less competition, residents appear more likely to have to pay higher prices next year, unless they qualify for a higher subsidy. And those larger rate increases are fodder for political attacks against the law, particularly in states with closely contested Senate races this fall, like Louisiana or Iowa.In one state with minimal competition, Vermont, the biggest insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, will be increasing the price of its lowest-cost silver plan by about 9 percent.For Jessica Porter, a psychiatric nurse practitioner from South Burlington, that is a problem. Her family of six is paying $1,637 a month for a platinum plan, which comes with relatively generous coverage but high premiums. But their income is too high to qualify for a subsidy, she said, so she and her husband have put off saving for retirement to pay their premiums.\u201cBlue Cross is basically the only player in town,\u201d she said.Most experts say there is not enough data yet on the entire population to determine whether the law is improving the nation\u2019s health.The best early data is on young people, and it suggests that the law is benefiting that group by allowing them to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance. The share of 19- to 25-year-olds without health insurance declined to 21 percent in the first quarter of this year, from 34 percent in 2010, a reduction of about four million people.Young college graduates were far more likely to report excellent health, to have a primary care doctor and to go to the doctor regularly than before the law.Indicators for how well the law is working for older people are few, but one \u2013 screenings for colon cancer \u2013 shows marked growth, as screening rates for people with private insurance rose to 56 percent in 2012, from 48 percent in 2010.By SABRINA TAVERNISEMost experts say there is not enough data yet on the entire population to determine whether the law is improving the nation\u2019s health.The best early data is on young people, and it suggests that the law is benefiting that group by allowing them to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance.

It was one of the first changes to happen under the 2010 law, giving researchers more data and turning the young into a kind of natural experiment.Most striking, however, was the effect on young college graduates. They were far more likely to report excellent health (an important indicator of future sickness and mortality, experts say), to have a primary care doctor, and to go to the doctor regularly than before the law.Outside the young adult age group, changes were more muted. An early look in September at the first quarter of 2014 found very little change in a dozen or so measures for the population at large, including the number of flu shots received, whether people had a regular place to go for medical care, and whether people had to forgo medical care because of cost.A few benefits, however, came early under the law, and some seemed to make a difference. Starting in 2010, the law required that insurance plans cover preventive screenings without charge to patients. One screening that has jumped is the colonoscopy. Screening rates for people with private insurance went from 48 percent in 2010 to 56 percent in 2012, according to the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a health research nonprofit organization that collects data from the majority of health plans in the country.Federal and state officials say that the online health care marketplaces that performed so badly last fall have been upgraded to ensure smoother service when they reopen Nov. 15.But both new and old customers are expected to flood onto the exchanges, testing their capacities, and the \u201cback end\u201d of the federal system, where insurers receive applications and bill the government for subsidy payments, is not completed.Though many of the 14 state-run exchanges are fine, several remain question marks, including those in Maryland, Massachusetts, Hawaii and Vermont.By ABBY GOODNOUGHFederal and state officials say that the online health care marketplaces that performed so badly last fall have been upgraded to ensure smoother service when they reopen Nov. 15.But both new and old customers are expected to flood onto the exchanges, testing their capacities, and the \u201cback end\u201d of the federal system, where insurers receive applications and bill the government for subsidy payments, is not completed.Though many of the 14 state-run exchanges are fine, several remain question marks, including those in Maryland, Massachusetts, Hawaii and Vermont.President Obama promised that buying health insurance on the online health care exchanges would be as easy as buying plane tickets on Kayak. Instead, most Americans were essentially locked out of HealthCare.gov, the federal online insurance marketplace that served 36 states, for two crucial months last fall. Many of the 14 state-run marketplaces also malfunctioned, and millions of tax dollars have been spent fixing all the defects.Now a question looms over the second enrollment period, which starts Nov. 15: Will the system work better this time around? Federal and state officials, and a number of outside experts, say they think it will.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get those blue screens of death anymore,\u201d said Dan Schuyler, senior director for exchange technology at Leavitt Partners, a consulting firm.But several significant new challenges will test the exchanges this time. Even as millions of new customers are expected to use the exchanges this fall, many of the 7.3 million who bought private marketplace plans last year will return to update information or seek better deals from different companies. Moreover, the \u201cback end\u201d of the federal exchange, which the government uses to enroll consumers in health plans and to send subsidy payments to insurers, remains unfinished.Nevada and Oregon have also given up on their botched state-run websites, which are now targets of lawsuits and investigations, and will use the federal marketplace instead. And Maryland and Massachusetts are scrambling to rebuild their sites with new software before open enrollment.The Congressional Budget Office predicts that total enrollment will grow to 13 million in 2015. Those already enrolled will need to renew their coverage by Dec. 15, and while they can do so automatically by taking no action, many may return to HealthCare.gov to shop around.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of demand to handle,\u201d Mr. Schuyler said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how well you plan and how many servers you have at the ready to take on this type of volume; at some point, things are going to slow down.\u201dThe federal exchange is trying to make things easier with a shorter and simpler application. The exchange also started testing earlier than last year.\u201cI\u2019m a realist, and we will not get it perfect,\u201d said Andrew Slavitt, principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, at a congressional hearing in September. \u201cBut we have, I think, the right processes in place to make it as good as it should be.\u201dAlthough most state-based exchanges are operating quite well at this point, a few are struggling. In Maryland, where at least $40 million has been spent rebuilding the exchange using technology from Connecticut\u2019s more successful version, tens of thousands of people who signed up for private coverage during the first enrollment period will have to re-enroll by mid-December if they want to keep their subsidy. The state will introduce its revamped website in phases, not opening it for general use until the fifth day of open enrollment.In Massachusetts, where the state and federal government are spending at least $80 million to fix its website with new software, officials promise it will work this fall.The future of troubled exchanges in Hawaii and Vermont is also in question. Vermont took its exchange offline last month to complete a number of repairs, although state officials say it will be working by Nov. 15. The Hawaii exchange, which just hired its third director, still has operational problems and is struggling more than most to stay afloat financially.Mr. Schuyler said the Obama administration \u201cis not going to give a state-based marketplace a green light unless they are completely confident it can make it.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t want a similar situation to last year,\u201d he added.Wall Street analysts and health care experts say the law helped the industry financially by providing new customers to insurers and new paying patients to hospitals.The most direct beneficiary of the law is the insurance industry, which is now experiencing growth in the demand for private insurance.The number of insurers participating in the online health exchanges is projected to grow in 2015, an indication of the anticipated profitability of the marketplace.By REED ABELSONWall Street analysts and health care experts say the law helped the industry financially by providing new customers to insurers and new paying patients to hospitals.The most direct beneficiary of the law is the insurance industry, which is now experiencing growth in the demand for private insurance.The number of insurers participating in the online health exchanges is projected to grow in 2015, an indication of the anticipated profitability of the marketplace.From the beginning, opponents of the Affordable Care Act have warned that it represented a \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d of the health care system that would lead to crippling regulations on both for-profit companies and nonprofit players. But to the contrary, Wall Street analysts and health care experts say, the industry appears to be largely flourishing, in part because of the additional business the law created.Health care accounts for roughly $3 trillion in spending in the United States so it is difficult to tease out the law\u2019s impact. The online exchanges have also been open for only a year. But analysts and policy experts who watch the industry closely agree that in the first year, the nation\u2019s health care system mostly benefited from the law, which brought new customers to insurers, new paying patients to hospitals and new prescription users to the pharmaceutical industry.\u201cThe irony is if you look sector by sector, the A.C.A. has resulted in pretty substantial earnings across the board,\u201d said Paul H. Keckley, managing director of the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis, a consulting firm unit.By one measure, the stock market, for-profit health insurers, hospitals and drug companies did well. One index that includes those companies, the S\u2009&\u2009P 500 Health Care Index, rose by 24 percent over the last year, outperforming the overall stock market.The health insurers are the most direct beneficiaries of the law. In recent years, the private insurance market for adults under 65 has steadily declined as more companies stopped offering insurance to employees and more individuals became unable to afford coverage, a trend expected to continue. But the Affordable Care Act has provided subsidies that have helped millions afford coverage. For the insurers, the health care exchanges are now \u201creally the only game in town in terms of growth\u201d for private insurance, said John F. Holahan, a policy expert from the Urban Institute.Most health care companieshave been posting healthy profits.QUARTERLY EARNINGS PER SHAREHospital companiesCommunityHealth Sys.Health Mgmt.AssociatesHCA+$10\u201912\u201914\u20131Health insurance companiesUnited HealthAetnaHumana+$3+2+10\u201912\u201914\u20131Pharmaceutical companiesNovartisPfizerAstraZeneca+$2+10\u201912\u201914\u20131+120%The S.& P. 500 health care indexhas beaten the S.& P. 500-stockindex since last year \u2026()()+90+60+30\u2026 and most health care companies have posted healthy profits so far this year.0\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914Hospital companiesQUARTERLY EARNINGS PER SHARECommunityHealth SystemsHealth Mgmt.AssociatesLifePointHospitalsTenetHealthcareUniversalHealth ServicesHCA+$10\u201912\u201914\u20131Health insurance companiesCignaUnited HealthAetnaHumanaWellpointMetLife+$3+2+10\u201912\u201914\u20131Pharmaceutical companiesJohnson& JohnsonNovartisPfizerAstraZenecaTevaEli Lilly+$2+10\u201912\u201914\u20131Source: BloombergOne clear sign that the carriers find the market attractive is the decision by more of them to offer policies through the online health exchanges. UnitedHealth Group, a for-profit company that operates one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, originally chose to offer individual plans through the exchanges in only a handful of states. But in 2015, the company says, it plans to offer plans in as many as two dozen. There are 56 new insurers entering the market so far this year, according to a count by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform.But contrary to what some liberals predicted, the law has not been a boon in every way for the insurance industry. State and federal officials are much more closely dictating what the insurers can do, and the marketplace had also encouraged more competition for the plans. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a more pressured environment,\u201d said Vishnu Lekraj, a senior health care analyst who follows the area for Morningstar Inc.The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that hospitals will save $5.7 billion in so-called uncompensated care costs this year because more people have insurance. And nearly three-quarters of those savings, $4.2 billion, has gone to the 25 states and the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid at the beginning of 2014.Whether such benefits continue remains unclear. But for now, the law is providing a \u201ctail wind\u201d to hospitals, said Michael D. Gregory, a portfolio manager for Highland Capital who invests in health care.The Affordable Care Act allows states to expand Medicaid to people not previously eligible, including some people above the poverty level \u2013 but the United States Supreme Court in 2012 ruled that expansion was optional for states.As a result, only 27 states and the District of Columbia have expanded, while Republican opposition in other states has blocked expansion.In states without expanded Medicaid, a coverage gap exists for people who earn too much to receive Medicaid, but too little to receive federal subsidies to reduce insurance premiums. About half of the people who fall in that gap nationally live in Texas, Florida or Georgia.Under pressure from hospitals that stand to gain federal funds from Medicaid expansion, Republican governors in several states are now moving toward expansion, some through so-called private option plans.By ROBERT PEARThe Affordable Care Act allows states to expand Medicaid to people not previously eligible, including some people above the poverty level \u2013 but the United States Supreme Court in 2012 ruled that expansion was optional for states.As a result, only 27 states and the District of Columbia have expanded, while Republican opposition in other states has blocked expansion.In states without expanded Medicaid, a coverage gap exists for people who earn too much to receive Medicaid, but too little to receive federal subsidies to reduce insurance premiums.

And in states that have expanded eligibility \u2014 to include people with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level (up to $16,105 for an individual) \u2014 Medicaid appears to be achieving that goal.Since last October, federal officials say, 8.7 million people have been added to the Medicaid rolls, 7.5 million of them in the 27 states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility. That is comparable to the 7.3 million people who obtained private insurance through the exchanges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\u201cStates that expanded Medicaid have seen a remarkable reduction in the number of uninsured, a drop of nearly 40 percent,\u201d said Stan Dorn, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group. \u201cThat compares with a reduction of less than 10 percent in states that have not expanded.\u201dNot all states have expanded Medicaid, because the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the expansion was optional. So governments in 23 states, most of them Republican-controlled, have blocked expansion, asserting that the cost could eventually become a state responsibility.How Medicaid enrollment has changed in each state       States that expanded their programs under the law are shown in greenN.M.35% ofpopulationenrolledVt.N.Y.30%Calif.W.Va.Ark.Del.Ore.,R.I25%Ky.Ohio, Ill.Miss.La.Wash.HawaiiAriz.,Mass.,Mich.\u00a0Okla.Tenn.Colo.Wis.20%Minn.Pa.*, N.C.Nev.Md.S.C., IowaInd., Ala.N.J.Ga., Idaho,Fla.Tex.,AlaskaMont.15%Kan., S.D.Mo.Neb.Wyo., UtahN.D.BEFOREAFTERVa., N.H.*10%5%+5 or more+2.5 to 5+1 to 2.5\u20131 to +1PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE0%Change in Medicaid coverage by stateExpanded Medicaid% Enrolled, 2013201410%1520253035Vt.Ky.Ore.W.Va.Ark.N.M.Nev.R.I.Colo.Wash.Calif.Md.Ariz.N.J.Minn.OhioIll.Mass.N.Y.Mich.IowaN.H.*N.D.Del.HawaiiPa.*Did not expandMont.Ga.Tenn.Miss.S.C.IdahoAla.Fla.Ind.AlaskaN.C.Tex.La.Okla.UtahWis.Kan.S.D.Wyo.Neb.Mo.Va.Note: Includes Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. \u201cBefore\u201d figures represent the average enrollment for the months of July 2013 through Sept. 2013 and are not available for Maine and Connecticut. \u201cAfter\u201d figures are from August 2014, the latest month available. Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ServicesThe government does not know for sure how many of the people gaining coverage under the Affordable Care Act were previously insured or uninsured.Moreover, sizable numbers of residents in those states, including childless adults and the working poor, fall into a coverage gap: They make too much for traditional Medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidies in the insurance exchanges.Researchers at the Urban Institute estimate that 6.3 million uninsured adults fall into that coverage gap, with about half living in three states: Texas (1.5 million), Florida (1 million) and Georgia (570,000). The group includes 1.6 million blacks, 1.3 million Latinos and 1.5 million people under the age of 25.Opposition to the expansion of Medicaid appears to be softening in some states, partly because of pressure from hospitals. Nine states with Republican governors, including Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, are expanding Medicaid. Republican governors in Indiana and Utah are negotiating with the Obama administration on possible expansion. And in Tennessee, the Republican governor is trying to find a way to expand Medicaid despite skepticism among Republican lawmakers.With so many new people in the expanded program, another question has emerged: Are there enough doctors to serve them? Many urban and rural areas were already struggling with shortages of doctors willing to take Medicaid patients before the law took effect, experts say.\u201cBeneficiaries have reported serious problems obtaining the care they need, particularly specialty care,\u201d said Sarah Somers, who represents poor people as a lawyer at the National Health Law Program.Health care spending had begun slowing even before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.The reasons included recession, higher-deductible policies that discourage people from seeking health care services, and a decline in the development of new, costly prescription drugs.But reductions in wasteful or unneeded care may also be factors in the slowdown, and experts say the Affordable Care Act may help reinforce those changes.In the short term, the law could actually drive up health care spending by bringing more insured people into the system.By MARGOT SANGER-KATZHealth care spending had begun slowing even before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.The reasons included recession, higher-deductible policies that discourage people from seeking health care services, and a decline in the development of new, costly prescription drugs.But reductions in wasteful or unneeded care may also be factors in the slowdown, and experts say the Affordable Care Act may help reinforce those changes.In the short term, the law could actually drive up health care spending by bringing more insured people into the system.National health care$9,582$10,000$6,0002010Law passes$2,000\u201960\u201980\u201900\u201914*from the previous year.+8%+6%+4%+3.1%+2%\u201961\u201980\u201900\u201914**Projection.

The authors of the Affordable Care Act believed that the key to wringing dollars out of the health care system was reducing unnecessary and wasteful care that cost money without helping patients. If the health care system is starting to do that, and new policy helps reward the welcome change, then there is a chance that the trend could hold.For that reason, Peter R. Orszag, the former Obama administration budget director and now a vice chairman at Citigroup, thinks that the Affordable Care Act should get only partial credit for the slowdown. \u201cI view it as kind of an accelerant and reinforcement,\u201d he said of the law.But the real long-term test of the health law will be whether, once those new people are absorbed into the system, the current downward trend in spending growth can be sustained.\u201cThe experiment is on, and everyone knows they\u2019re a lab rat,\u201d said Douglas J.

{"Headline": "Will Cities Turn Texas Purple?", "Date": "2014-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 FOR most of a long, hot summer, Wendy Davis\u2019s campaign for governor here resembled a cowboy lost in the desert \u2014 horseless, stumbling and finally just left for dead in the remorseless Texas heat. Despite a strong national profile, she trailed her Republican opponent, Attorney General Greg Abbott, sometimes by double digits. Among the experts, a conventional wisdom set in: Ms. Davis can\u2019t win, Republicans can\u2019t lose and Texas won\u2019t change. Yet as summer has turned to fall, Ms. Davis has entered new territory: Last week a poll by the Texas Lyceum, a nonpartisan, nonprofit educational institution, showed that Ms. Davis has narrowed that gap to just nine points, and pundits around the state are talking about a new momentum behind her. What happened? The short answer is tactics. Ms. Davis\u2019s campaign hasn\u2019t been perfect, but she is dogged on the stump, and has stood up well to Mr. Abbott\u2019s attacks.Of course, Ms. Davis is still nine points back, and she has just five weeks to catch up. Which is why the longer explanation for her turnaround is more important, not just for Texas, but the country. Many hoping to see Texas go purple point to the growth of its Hispanic community. And that\u2019s part of it, but not everything. Population growth, soaring diversity and dense urbanization are also transforming Texas, much as they have done in Virginia and North Carolina. This goes against the conventional wisdom about Texas politics, which is often rooted in a historical shorthand that begins with the election of George W. Bush as governor in 1994. Before that, the state was reliably Democratic; after that, it has gotten redder and redder. In reality, Texas\u2019 realignment was a process, not an event, 30 years in the making. In the 1970s and 1980s, the two major parties battled for power. Yet social change, the arrival of migrants from the Rust Belt, ultimately resolved the matter. They settled in the suburbs and voted solidly Republican. Harris County, which includes the city of Houston, voted Republican in every presidential election from 1992 to 2004. Today that realignment is being almost precisely reversed. Texas\u2019 economy has been booming almost nonstop since 2000, and the state added 4.3 million people between 2000 and 2010. Americans came from every point on the map. Once a minority, the Hispanic population swelled, too, and will be the largest ethnic group in Texas this year (some say they could be the majority by 2020). Houston is not merely more Hispanic; the fastest-growing ethnic group is Asian. The kimchi taco is a hit. Some 90 languages are spoken. The city government will soon publish information in six languages. And 98 percent of the population growth in the first 10 years of this century has been nonwhite.This diversity is rippling out to the far suburbs, counties that have long been white and Republican \u2014 and vital for winning statewide office. The most diverse part of the Houston region is now Missouri City, which straddles Brazoria County and Fort Bend County on the city\u2019s southwestern edge and is filling with Hispanics, Asians and African-Americans seeking bigger homes and better schools. The same trends are found in the Texas Triangle, an increasingly dense region bounded by Houston, San Antonio and Dallas-Fort Worth. It includes less than 20 percent of the state\u2019s land but all its biggest cities. Conservative politicians do poorly in these settings. The political shift is unmistakable. In Houston, 83 percent of residents favor a legal path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Six in 10 say abortion is morally wrong but oppose making it harder for women to get one. In August, an effort to repeal Houston\u2019s new equal protection ordinance for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual people failed. Not only did Harris County vote for Barack Obama in 2008, but in 2012 it was joined by all of Texas\u2019 big urban counties and cities, which Democrats have controlled for years. Republican strength is on the wane in some of those key suburbs, too. The Republican margin in Fort Bend County shrank in 2012 from double digits to just six points.None of this is to say that Ms. Davis will win \u2014 but she might. And four years from now, she, or another candidate, will have an even easier time. No, that dusky sky up there is not blue. It is still burnt orange \u2014 but with quite a bit of purple.Richard Parker is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cLone Star Nation: How Texas Will Transform America.\u201d Advertisement"}

Ad\u00e1n Abraham de la Cruz, 23, wanted to put his computer skills to good use in the classroom.\u201cHe was just preparing himself to get ahead like any young person would do,\u201d said Mr. de la Cruz\u2019s father, Bernab\u00e9.Now, they are among 43 students reported missing after deadly clashes with the police on Sept. 26, when at least six student protesters and bystanders were killed in the restive, rural state of Guerrero, one of the poorest in the country and long afflicted by political, social and criminal upheaval.The state prosecutor investigating why the police opened fire on students from their vehicles has found mass graves in Iguala \u2014 the small industrial city where the confrontations occurred \u2014 containing 28 badly burned and dismembered bodies.The prosecutors had already arrested 22 police officers after the clashes, saying the officers secretly worked for, or were members of, a local gang. Now they are investigating whether the police apprehended the students after the confrontation and deliberately turned them over to the local gang. Two witnesses in custody told prosecutors that the gang then killed the protesters on the orders of a leader known as El Chucky.\u201cI saw police trucks go up and down the hill to up there, where the bodies are found,\u201d said one man in the neighborhood near the site who declined to give his name out of fear. \u201cThen came the news they found the grave and it may be the students. But you would be a fool around here to accuse the police and expect to live.\u201dEven in a country accustomed to mass killings, the case has generated alarm, both for the possible involvement of the police and for the fact that the students were not known to have criminal ties. Miguel Mart\u00ednez, a representative for the families, said students at the school had fought back against extortion attempts by gangs last year, but it was not clear if that could have made them a target now.The students, by many accounts, had been soliciting money in Iguala for an Oct. 2 demonstration rejecting cuts to their state-financed school, which opened in 1926 and has long played a role in local social justice movements. Such student demonstrations are part of a well-known militancy that goes back decades and has provoked violence in the past. It did again this time, as students got into a skirmish with the police when they tried to steal buses to take to and from the demonstration, human rights groups said.The mayor and the police chief of Iguala are now on the run, having disappeared after being subpoenaed in the case, and the governor of the state confirmed that the local gang, known as Guerreros Unidos, had infiltrated the police force in Iguala, as well as other police departments in the state.The specter of corrupted police has haunted Mexico for years. But these disappearances come at a time when President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is already confronting the prosecution of at least three soldiers charged with homicide in another recent case \u2014 the shooting death of 22 people captured in a warehouse in June.\u201cI feel deeply outraged and dismayed,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto told reporters Monday, referring to the violence here and dispatching the attorney general and other federal forces to the region. \u201cI regret, in particular, the violence that occurred and especially that it was young students who were affected and whose rights were violated in the city of Iguala.\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s predecessor, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, also faced wave after wave of police corruption scandals, with some entire local forces dismissed. But experts say that, even as violence soared, both administrations fell behind in putting in place measures to hold law enforcement authorities accountable.Only this year did Mexico pass a law allowing members of the military to be tried in civilian courts for human rights abuses, and many feel that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has been more focused on shifting the dialogue to Mexico\u2019s economy than on fighting corruption and improving security.\u201cA serious and sustained effort at reforming local police agencies has been a pending agenda for a long time in Mexico,\u201d said Matthew C. Ingram, an assistant professor at the University at Albany who studies justice in Mexico. \u201cAs long as local, municipal police agencies remain weak, they will not have the capacity to generate public trust or resist corruption and capture.\u201dHere at the small, 500-student mountaintop teachers college, Escuela Normal Rural Ra\u00fal Isidro Burgos, where cows and stray dogs roam freely and walls are adorned with slogans like \u201cprotest is a right, repression is a crime,\u201d a hodgepodge of human rights and radical groups and representatives of the families have vowed paralyzing strikes across the country on Wednesday to keep the pressure on the authorities for answers.Parents of the missing students doubt the effectiveness of state investigators. A team of forensic experts from Argentina with long experience in mass disappearance cases has arrived, and on Monday it began interviewing family members and collecting other data as part of an independent investigation, though it was unclear if the experts would have access to the bodies found.States officials said it could take at least two weeks and possibly longer to identify the remains because of their poor condition.And if the bodies are not those of the missing students, the question remains: Where did they come from?Several parents said they still hoped their children would be found alive. Although the number of missing has fluctuated, the current list of 43 was developed after students and human rights representatives said they had called family members and friends and searched school grounds and other places, failing to account for 43 classmates.\u201cWe have to keep looking and praying,\u201d said Santa Cruz Castro, the father of Leonel.He last spoke to his son when Leonel called him the day of the confrontation, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad, I am going to the march,\u201d which Mr. Cruz took to mean the collection drive in Iguala. \u201cAnd then I didn\u2019t hear from him and saw the news about the shootings. We didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201dIn a sign of defiance and concern, placards and bumper stickers are popping up here and in other cities in Guerrero on buses, storefronts and buildings. Their slogan \u2014 #HastaEncontrarlos \u2014 means: \u201cUntil they are found.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Boeing\u2019s Earnings Jump, but Higher Costs for 787 Weigh on Its Shares", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoeing\u2019s stock fell $5.67 a share, to $121.45, on more than three times its normal volume.The decline came after the company disclosed that the deferred production cost for the 787 program rose 3.9 percent over the last three months to approximately $25.2 billion, and it could go higher.Boeing still loses money on each of the innovative carbon composite planes that it delivers. The deferred production cost accounts for the gap between what it actually costs the company to build each plane and the average cost it has projected for the first 1,300 aircraft.Under an accounting method that Boeing has long used, it can book profits on aircraft sales now against that average projected cost. But it has to keep a running tally of the additional cost of each plane as the deferred cost total.Boeing previously said the deferred costs would peak at about $25 billion for the Dreamliner program. Stock analysts track that number closely for clues to when the giant program will start generating cash for the company, and several analysts expressed concern on the company\u2019s earnings call Wednesday that the number had crossed $25 billion.Gregory D. Smith, Boeing\u2019s chief financial officer, responded that $200 million of the latest increase in the deferred cost total reflected the company\u2019s decision to accelerate parts purchases for a second version of the plane, the 787-9, to reduce production risks.He said Boeing could also accelerate additional expenditures on the 787-9 and a larger model, the 787-10, if that would help lower costs in the long run.Mr. Smith also said that Boeing still expected to start making a profit on Dreamliner deliveries next year, with the sales prices exceeding the actual cost of building the planes. And he said that after Boeing increased its production rate for the jets to 12 each month in 2016 from 10 now, the deferred cost total should begin to decline more rapidly.The Dreamliner, which uses lightweight carbon composites instead of metal to slash fuel costs, set records for advance orders before its debut three years ago. Boeing and its main rival, Airbus, also have experienced surges in sales for most of their models as the world economy has recovered from recession and airlines sought more fuel-efficient planes.Boeing said on Wednesday that its core operating earnings, excluding pensions and some other costs, rose 13 percent in the third quarter to $2.43 billion, from $2.14 billion a year earlier. Given that the company repurchased eight million shares during the quarter, its earnings jumped 19 percent on a per-share basis, to $2.14 from $1.80 a year earlier. Boeing also raised its guidance for its core earnings for all of 2014, to $8.10 to $8.30 a share from the previous $7.90 to $8.10.Revenue increased 7 percent, to $23.78 billion, from $22.13 billion in the 2013 third quarter, as commercial plane shipments rose.Boeing delivered 186 commercial airplanes, including 31 Dreamliners, in the latest quarter. That compared with 170, including 23 Dreamliners, a year earlier.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hong Kong Officials and Protesters Agree to Talk ", "Date": "2014-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a preliminary session late Tuesday, government negotiators and student leaders agreed that the formal talks set to begin on Friday would address how to change the electoral system, within the framework of the Basic Law, the mini-constitution that governs Hong Kong. The local authorities and the central government in Beijing have insisted that the changes the students seek are against those rules.The students and many of the thousands of Hong Kong residents who demonstrated with them over the past week and a half want nominations to be open, allowing voters, not a committee or a political party, to put forward candidates. But the talks will instead be confined to a narrow discussion of the legal and constitutional basis for how elections can be set up under the Basic Law, whose final interpreter is China\u2019s Communist Party-dominated legislature. Lau Kong-wah, Hong Kong\u2019s under secretary of constitutional and mainland affairs, called it \u201cconstitutional development.\u201d\u201cThe government is insincere,\u201d Lester Shum, deputy secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, told reporters on Tuesday evening. \u201cI hope when we actually meet, they can directly face Hong Kong\u2019s political issues.\u201dMr. Shum said any move to shut down the protests, which have blocked one of Hong Kong\u2019s most important transportation arteries and several commercial districts, would scuttle the talks.With the government demanding that streets be cleared by the start of business this week and calls from some protest supporters to scale back the sit-ins, the number of demonstrators has dwindled drastically, but many barricades have been maintained.Following a familiar pattern established last week, by nightfall on Tuesday the number of people in the protest zones was swelling again as supporters returned from work and school \u2014 but remained much lower than in previous days.At dinnertime, more than 200 people were in the protest zone in Causeway Bay, a neon-lit shopping district. Many of those inside the zone \u2014 which in normal times is a busy thoroughfare for cars, trams and buses \u2014 were looking at their cellphones. A few slept on plastic sheets.In the morning, the number of people camped out on Harcourt Road near the office of the chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, whose resignation many protesters have called for, appeared to be no more than 100.The scene in Mong Kok, across Victoria Harbor in Kowloon, was similar. Protesters numbered only in the dozens, with their copious provisions \u2014 tents, crates of food, water bottles \u2014 giving the illusion of a much larger crowd.Hui Chan-tak, the chief spokesman of the Hong Kong Police, called on Tuesday afternoon for an end to protests in Mong Kok, and strongly criticized protest leaders for suggesting that their supporters remain there. \u201cI urge students to leave for their own safety,\u201d he said.Michael C. Davis, a law professor at Hong Kong University, said that the movement should \u201cdeclare victory\u201d and end the sit-in now, rather than have it dwindle and allow the police to end it with a simple clearing operation. That way, he said, organizers can preserve the threat of future movements to get more leverage in talks with the government, a tactic he said was used by Poland\u2019s Solidarity labor movement in the 1980s.\u201cI think they moved the needle a little because they shocked the government,\u201d Mr. Davis said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut to turn it into a victory there are more steps to take, and I think just lingering on the street isn\u2019t necessarily going to get them there.\u201dOne Chinese newspaper editor who focuses on Hong Kong said Beijing was intent on dragging the situation out to strengthen its hand, as more and more Hong Kong citizens grow tired of the road blockages that can make travel around the city extremely inconvenient and cost shopkeepers money because of the drop in tourists from the mainland.For nine days, waves of pro-democracy protests engulfed Hong Kong, swelling at times to tens of thousands of people and raising tensions with Beijing.\u201cSo I think the government just decided to wait it out and let Hong Kong authorities manage things, because as the protests wear on, they\u2019ve known that the spontaneous opposition to the protests will grow bigger and bigger,\u201d the editor said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of discussing internal decision-making. \u201cIt will start to have a real impact on commerce and the economy will be affected.\u201dStill, many of the protesters say they plan to stay until the government agrees to their demands.Tom Chiu, 20, a computer science major at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, who has been at the Mong Kok site since Friday, said he was prepared to stay indefinitely. The son of a postal worker and a nurse, he said he was outraged by the large income gaps in Hong Kong.\u201cIf there\u2019s more democracy I think Hong Kong people can have better living conditions,\u201d Mr. Chiu said.The standoff between the two sides was punctuated by an act of pettiness against one of the student leaders, Joshua Wong. Rylie Ip, a real estate agent, posted what he said was Mr. Wong\u2019s home address late Sunday night on his Facebook page, asking people to \u201coccupy\u201d the home. The move set off outrage online for the apparent breach of privacy. The address he provided was incorrect.Mr. Ip\u2019s company, Midland Realty, said in a written statement on Tuesday that it had \u201cdeep regrets\u201d over the \u201cpublic discontent\u201d that Mr. Ip\u2019s remarks caused. Mr. Ip could not be reached for comment.And in another sign of tensions in Hong Kong, an editor for the South China Morning Post, Cliff Buddle, was assaulted Monday by an unidentified man from mainland China at the University of Hong Kong while giving a lecture, the newspaper reported. The paper quoted witnesses as saying the man, who said he was a student at a university in Beijing, shouted that classes in Hong Kong should be conducted in Mandarin instead of English. Mr. Buddle was treated for injuries to his chest and a hand and released from a hospital, the paper reported. Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting from Beijing, and Edward Wong and Hilda Wang from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ...Denmark", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateThe Lighthouse development opened in 2012 in Aarhus, Denmark\u2019s second-largest city after Copenhagen. A TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE CITY OF AARHUS3.35 MILLION DANISH KRONER ($570,000)This two-bedroom apartment has about 850 square feet of living space, including a wraparound balcony that overlooks the city\u2019s harbor. It is on the fourth floor of a development called the Lighthouse, which opened in 2012 as the first residential component of the Docklands, an ambitious project to refashion the waterfront of Aarhus, Denmark\u2019s second-largest city, with a population of about 300,000. The d\u00e9cor, in typical Danish style, is minimal and modern, with white walls and pale wood flooring.A small entrance foyer opens up to the combined living/dining space. The integrated galley kitchen is to the left, with white lacquer cabinets designed by the Danish company HTH. The appliances, all by Siemens, include an induction cooktop, an electric oven and a dishwasher and refrigerator with faceplates that match the cabinets.The living room has floor-to-ceiling windows, and there is space for a generously sized dining table. The main bedroom has a walk-in closet, and a smaller second bedroom can also be used as an office. The bathroom, reached through the foyer, has a tiled shower stall and a full-size washer and dryer, also by Siemens. The balcony is reached through the two bedrooms and is deep enough to accommodate a small dining table and comfortable chairs. Heating is under-floor, but there is no air-conditioning, as temperatures in Aarhus rarely exceed 80 degrees in the summer, and cooling breezes come from the bay.An underground parking space is available, but the center of Aarhus is just a five- to seven-minute bike ride or bus trip away, and a light-rail line will eventually run the length of the pier. An energetic resident could even kayak through the harbor. The Aarhus airport is about a 45-minute drive, and Copenhagen is about three hours by car, either via ferry across the Kattegat sea from Aarhus or by driving south and east through the island of Fyn. MARKET OVERVIEWUrban redevelopment has reshaped the face of Aarhus over the last few decades. The small Aarhus River, concealed under a boulevard in the 1930s, was uncovered about 20 years ago, and its banks are now lined with cafes and shops.Most of the stand-alone houses can be found closer to the ring road that surrounds Aarhus, with the Risskov district to the north popular with expatriate business people. Houses there can sell for $750,000 and up, agents said.Nonetheless, prices in Aarhus did not fall that far, Mr. Bocian said, for several reasons, including a large university population, the lack of a bubble before the recent crisis, and a diverse job market that includes some of the largest companies in Denmark and multinationals like Google. Denmark also has very low mortgage interest rates, under 3 percent for a 30-year loan.But Mr. Borregaard sounded a note of caution: \u201cThe number of sales have increased and prices have been rising, but in the last quarter we\u2019ve seen that prices have actually dropped a bit,\u201d he said.\u201cWe think people still remember the economic crisis and they don\u2019t want prices to go into the sky,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople are thinking it can\u2019t go up this fast already. So they\u2019re waiting to buy.\u201d WHO BUYS IN AARHUSMost buyers are Danish, agents said, in part because of the country\u2019s restrictions on foreign buyers. In recent years, the Danish economy has increasingly focused on Copenhagen and Aarhus, and those cities have drawn buyers from more rural areas in search of jobs. BUYING BASICSThere are restrictions on foreign buyers in Denmark. In most cases, citizens of the European Union or European Economic Area who are working in Denmark can buy property without a permit from the Ministry of Justice. Prospective buyers who do not meet those criteria will need to obtain a permit. Mr. Voldsgaard said the permits were not difficult to get for such buyers who already lived in Denmark, though they are difficult to obtain otherwise.Transaction costs in Denmark are relatively low. Mr. Voldsgaard and other agents recommend that buyers retain a lawyer; fees range from about $1,300 to $2,600 per transaction. A notary handles contracts and ensures that a transfer tax of 0.6 percent is paid. Notary fees are nominal, about $250, he said.WEBSITESLANGUAGE AND CURRENCYDanish; krone (1 krone = 17 cents)TAXES AND FEESTotal property taxes on the apartment are about $4,000 a year, Mr. Voldsgaard said. In addition, there is a monthly maintenance fee of about $300.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Specializing in Ordinary Ordeals", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCross CutsTelluride, Colo. \u2014 Wage stagnation, income inequality, the living wage, the decline of the middle class: These issues may be pushed out of the headlines by more dramatic crises, but they continue to preoccupy political discourse, especially in the United States and Europe. At the movies, economic injustice is occasionally grist for allegory \u2014 as in Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d the action-movie sleeper of the summer \u2014 and more frequently an axiom of realism. And for the past 15 years or so, cinematic realism has been virtually synonymous with the name Dardenne, as in Jean-Pierre and Luc, Belgian brothers, now 63 and 60, who have twice won the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes.\u201cTwo Days, One Night,\u201d their latest film, finds global significance in a slender, almost anecdotal story about a worker\u2019s ordeal. The same might be said of any of the brothers\u2019 other major fictional features, which cast a naturalistic eye on the daily lives of poor and somewhat less poor residents of Belgium\u2019s French-speaking industrial heartland. The Dardennes are faithful chroniclers of a European working class in crisis, and their austere methods have influenced filmmakers from Argentina to Kazakhstan \u2014 wherever problems of labor, subsistence and economic survival seem especially acute. Which is just about everywhere, nowadays.Since the appearance of \u201cLa Promesse\u201d in 1996, the brothers have been the pre-eminent heirs of a battered and durable neorealist tradition, and they have become known \u2014 and in the world of international film festivals, celebrated \u2014 for consistency of style and theme. They shoot their films in and around Seraing, where they grew up, and cast local actors, professional and otherwise, along with an occasional French or Belgian movie star. (Marion Cotillard, with worried eyes and weary posture and without a trace of actorly vanity, has the lead in \u201cTwo Days.\u201d) There is a typical, often-imitated Dardennes shot: a hand-held camera following behind a character, whose point of view is both emphasized and obscured by the framing. And also a typical Dardennes protagonist: a person in difficult circumstances who is forced to make a costly, morally wrenching choice. In a recent interview here \u2014 a stop on the festival itinerary that has taken \u201cTwo Days\u201d from Cannes to Toronto to New York, where it screens Sunday in advance of a Christmas commercial release in the United States \u2014 Luc Dardenne, on this occasion the more talkative brother, summed up the existential theme of their work. \u201cIt may be too simple to put it this way,\u201d he said, \u201cbut all of our films recount how a person emerges from his or her solitude, and unites with another, or several others. \u2018The Son,\u2019 \u2018Rosetta,\u2019 \u2018La Promesse\u2019: One way or another, we show how someone encounters somebody else, and how this encounter is transformative, how it resolves the isolation that had kept the main character outside of society, outside the community.\u201d The accuracy of this assessment is plain enough. Even when the plots take a grim turn, toward unemployment, prison or violence, they never let go of the possibility of human connection, of the recognition that affirms an individual\u2019s membership in some larger collective identity: a couple, a family, a team, a class, the human species. Though Luc described this idea in abstract, almost philosophical terms, it has a clear ethical and even political dimension. In \u201cLa Promesse,\u201d a boy is torn between loyalty to his father, who runs a construction company that employs mainly undocumented immigrants, and the knowledge that their working conditions are dangerous and illegal. The sense of responsibility that weighs so heavily on him, and that forces him to choose between two forms of betrayal, arises from a larger injustice.In \u201cThe Son\u201d (2003), perhaps the most intimate of the Dardennes\u2019 movies, a carpentry teacher finds himself serving as mentor to the young man responsible for the death of his son, and confounded by warring impulses of revenge and forgiveness. But matters of class and labor hover over that tale as well. The grieving father (played by Olivier Gourmet, a polestar of the Dardenne universe) is grounded in the dignity of work and the discipline of craft. The nihilism he sees in the sullen teenage killer is a symptom of the loss of such values, a loss that haunts nearly every frame the Dardennes have shot. How to wade through the crush of culture coming your way this season? Here\u2019s a guide to 100 events that have us especially excited, in order of appearance.It afflicts the reckless protagonist of \u201cL\u2019Enfant\u201d (2005), a shallow young charmer who blithely drifts from petty crime to outright monstrosity, selling his newborn baby and buying matching leather jackets for himself and his girlfriend with some of the proceeds. If he can\u2019t find honest work, he can at least experience some of the pleasures of consumerism, and giving up his firstborn seems at first like a reasonable enough exchange. The title character of \u201cRosetta\u201d (1999), the first Dardenne brothers film to win the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes (\u201cL\u2019Enfant\u201d was the second) is a 17-year-old girl at war with everything in the universe, including herself, her alcoholic mother, a factory manager and the short-order cook who may be her only friend. Rosetta\u2019s antisocial and self-destructive behavior expresses a desire that is at once primal and practical, banal and profound. What she wants, above all, is to work, and to secure the kind of social identity and human connection that a job can provide. In \u201cTwo Days, One Night,\u201d the need for work is also what motivates Sandra, who is in many ways Rosetta\u2019s opposite: a soft-spoken woman living with her husband and two children in a tidy, modern townhouse. But Sandra\u2019s anguish, manifested as depression rather than rage, is every bit as raw as Rosetta\u2019s, and the stakes of her struggle are if anything even higher. Laid off after returning from a medical leave, she must persuade her co-workers to give up their bonuses to cover her salary. The film\u2019s title and its against-the-clock structure come from conditions dictated by her boss. On Monday morning, the 16 members of Sandra\u2019s team will vote on her fate, and she has the weekend to persuade them to sacrifice their interests \u2014 1,000 euros they have each sweated to earn and desperately need \u2014 for her well-being. \u201cShe is a person we had thought about for 10 years,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. The idea of a worker forced to bargain for her job not with management but with her fellow employees was a potent metaphor for the state of modern capitalism to begin with, but in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and its harsh, prolonged aftermath it took on particular relevance. \u201cIn 2010, 2012 we really began to see the social and economic consequences,\u201d Luc said, \u201cand that was what brought us back to this scenario, and convinced us to make the film. There were a lot more people out of work in our area, and not only in our area.\u201d Anecdotes that mirrored Sandra\u2019s predicament became more common: Luc noted that in the months since the French premiere of \u201cTwo Days\u201d in the spring, three companies in Belgium and France had subjected their employees to similar choices.\u201cIt\u2019s true that we pay attention to what the stories might say about social relations in Western countries,\u201d Jean-Pierre said, referring to their work in general. \u201cBut it\u2019s always our intention to make films about the characters in their situations, and not to use them as mouthpieces for a particular position. If there is a political point of view in the films, it has to arise from the action, from the circumstances.\u201d Sandra\u2019s experiences are a perfect illustration of this method. The viewer accompanies her as she knocks on doors and makes anxious phone calls in her effort to speak with every one of her colleagues. For her and for us, the repetitiveness of these encounters is grueling and uncomfortable, but it is also crucial to the film\u2019s emotional power. Each meeting is unique, because each person Sandra talks to has particular responses and concerns. One man, in the midst of a pickup soccer game, bursts into tears. Another threatens Sandra with violence. Some have trouble meeting her eyes; others are forthright in their support or refusal. A few decline to commit one way or another. But as Jean-Pierre put it: \u201cEach one is as important as Sandra. There are no secondary roles.\u201d There is also no judgment, either from Sandra or the filmmakers. What makes her ordeal especially painful is her strong feeling that she has no right to ask her colleagues to give up their hard-won money on her behalf. Why should her needs trump theirs? But of course, this is a profoundly political question. \u201cThe subject of the film is solidarity,\u201d Luc said. In the history of labor, in Europe and other Western countries, that word has associations that stretch from the organizers and agitators of the Industrial Workers of the World in the American West during World War I to the Gdansk shipyard workers in the waning years of the Cold War. That ideal, in the view of the Dardennes, has been eroded by an ethic of competition and selfishness. \u201cWe wanted to show something of the state we\u2019re in now,\u201d Luc said. \u201cPeople are intensely individualistic. They all have money problems. They are all in debt: paying for the house, the car, the kids. Everyone is in a state of insecurity, of fear. We wanted to show that, how people are in a precarious state. In the movie, they are almost all working more than one job, not to get rich, but to have enough money to pay for what they need.\u201dUnlike some Dardennes heroes and heroines, Sandra and her family \u2014 and most of the families she visits \u2014 live in at least modest comfort. In this country, they would be called middle class: They have some nice things, enough food, a television, a car. Sandra parks in private driveways and makes her pitch in tidy backyards. But the pathos of the film comes from the perceived fragility of this standard of living, the terror that unemployment will mean not only lost income, but also the more cataclysmic loss of newly won social status, of normalcy. That is an anxiety that might hit home especially hard in America, where individualism is more deeply rooted and where the fall from the middle class is less cushioned by social benefits and workplace protections. The setting of \u201cTwo Days, One Night\u201d may be specifically Belgian, but it is easy to imagine similar stories being told here about fast-food and retail workers, baristas and sales associates, house painters and middle managers who feel the ground shifting under them and their hold on the American dream slipping.

{"Headline": "Unity on Eurozone Growth Eludes Germany and France", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Anyone hoping that last week\u2019s market turmoil might spur Germany and France to take decisive action to spur growth in the eurozone was disappointed on Monday. After meeting here, top ministers from the two nations agreed only to work on a plan they will present in December.With concern rising that the eurozone is slipping into recession, and the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund calling on eurozone leaders to do more for the economy, expectations were high that leaders meeting in Berlin might reach a grand bargain.The German government was expected to agree to invest more in public works if France took steps to improve growth through measures like relaxing labor rules.But a full six years after a global financial collapse from which the eurozone has still not fully recovered, Monday\u2019s meeting was a reminder of the incremental way that policy plays out in Europe, even in the face of crisis. In the European Union\u2019s loose confederation, national leaders try to maintain a precarious balance between their change-averse voters and the impatient demands of international financial markets.Often, as in Berlin on Monday, problems are not so much solved as referred to a study group.Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Sigmar Gabriel, the German finance and economics ministers, and their counterparts Michel Sapin and Emmanuel Macron, said at news conference here on Monday that they would not present any specific proposals until a meeting planned for Dec. 1.Mr. Sapin said, \u201cWe want to offer specific proposals \u2014 not just announcements but concrete proposals.\u201dBut it was difficult not to conclude that the prevailing position on Monday was Germany\u2019s continued reluctance to spend its taxpayers\u2019 money on priming the euro pump.At the very least, the joint appearance, which the ministers said had been planned well before recent market turmoil, served as a show of solidarity to rebut perceptions that Berlin and Paris are no longer able to work together. As the ministers acknowledged, Europe has rarely if ever made political progress without cooperation by Germany and France.Expectations of a tacit accord had nonetheless been high after Mr. Sapin and Mr. Macron on Sunday called on Germany to invest at least 50 billion euros, or $64 billion, through 2017. That was seen as a way to offset the \u20ac50 billion in spending cuts that France has planned in the same period to meet Berlin\u2019s demands for deficit reduction.\u201cIt is in our collective interest that Germany invests,\u201d Mr. Macron said in a joint interview with Mr. Sapin in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.A spending commitment by Germany would help provide France\u2019s leaders with political cover while they pursue unpopular measures that economists say are needed to cut French unemployment, in particular a rollback of laws that make it difficult and costly to dismiss workers. Strict French labor rules discourage companies from hiring in the first place, some economists argue.Matthias Kullas, an analyst at the Center for European Policy in Freiburg, Germany, said \u20ac50 billion of public investment would be \u201ca flash in the pan\u201d in terms of affecting growth. But, he said, \u201cit would provide a face-saving way to sell reforms to French voters.\u201dBut Mr. Sch\u00e4uble gave no indication that the German government was ready to waver from its determination to have a balanced budget next year and to avoid issuing any new debt. He and Mr. Gabriel said any such investment would have to include a large dollop of spending by the private sector.While popular among voters in Germany, tight-budget measures are seen by many economists as shortsighted, given that the German government can borrow money that is effectively interest-free. Investment in universities, research and development, or roads would pay off in the form of faster growth, many economists argue. Because Germany is the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy, its growth tends to benefit the entire region.Monday\u2019s meeting did nothing to bolster European stocks, which were already down after a short-lived rally at the end of last week. The German index, the DAX, has down the most \u2014 by 1.5 percent, with a big drag from the German software company SAP, whose shares fell nearly 6 percent after a profit warning. The CAC 40, in France, fell slightly more than 1 percent.At the prospect of a third recession in the eurozone in five years, a debate has swirled over where new growth might come from. While Germany continues to press for more budgetary discipline from France and other countries whose budget deficits grew during the crisis, a number of countries have pushed Germany to take the lead on spending.Last week, the International Monetary Fund joined that call, asking Germany to increase infrastructure spending in light of signs that its economy also was slowing.Germany and France are also responding in part to pressure from the European Central Bank, which has called on eurozone countries to overhaul their labor laws while saying that countries that can afford it \u2014 a group that includes Germany \u2014 should spend more to improve public infrastructure.Leaders of other eurozone nations hope that more spending by the German government would spill across the country\u2019s borders and help the rest of the eurozone.Paris is seeking German support for \u2014 or at least trying to avoid Berlin\u2019s active resistance to \u2014 the French government\u2019s proposed budget for 2015. The proposal essentially asks for leniency from Brussels to meet European Union deficit targets, after France already missed two deadlines in the last three years.In Berlin, Mr. Sapin pledged allegiance to budget limits, which he said were essential to maintaining trust in the eurozone.\u201cIn France, the deficit is too high, that\u2019s clear,\u201d he said. But Mr. Sapin did not say how France would get its budget back within limits prescribed by the treaties that were part of creation of the common currency.At least on Monday, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble refrained from criticizing French budget policy. Mr. Gabriel noted that the rules provide some flexibility for countries in distress.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy has taken a similar stance of deficit defiance, and last week unveiled a budget heavy on stimulus, including investments and tax cuts, to offset the effects of the country having slipped back into a recession.Mr. Sapin and Mr. Macron promised that they would reform the French economy, but on their own terms.Mr. Sapin said: \u201cOne country telling the other what to do \u2014 that has never worked. We are making reforms in France because they are good for France, not because we were asked to.\u201dIn France, Mr. Sapin and Mr. Macron are likely to face significant public and union opposition to any changes in the rules that currently give workers a strong say in company management and that make it difficult and costly to dismiss people. Many economists argue that such rules discourage hiring, and point to Spain as an example of a country where deregulation has translated into faster growth.But the economic benefits of such changes are a tough sell to voters who fear that their jobs would become less secure \u2014 especially in France, where Fran\u00e7ois Hollande already has the lowest popularity rating of any modern French president.Signs of flagging growth in Germany have raised anxiety about a recurrence of the crisis that nearly destroyed the eurozone two years ago. Concern about Europe contributed to turmoil in stock exchanges and bond markets around the world last week.The global anxiety was made worse by tensions between France and Germany.The rapprochement on view at the German Finance Ministry on Monday was an attempt by Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, an outspoken Francophile, to show that the two countries\u2019 policy differences had not fundamentally shaken their alliance. But, as is the case in France, domestic politics in Germany can act as a restraint on policies that might benefit the wider eurozone.Chancellor Angela Merkel, leader of the Christian Democratic Union, the party to which Mr. Sch\u00e4uble also belongs, faces dissent from conservatives who oppose the use of German tax revenue to help the rest of the eurozone. The Alternative for Germany, a right-wing party that wants to scrap the euro, has drained votes from Ms. Merkel\u2019s party in recent state elections.In France, Mr. Hollande faces a serious challenge from the far-right party National Front, and the leaders acknowledged on Monday that they needed to cut unemployment to reduce that party\u2019s appeal.Mr. Gabriel said the goal of the measures to be presented in December should be to strengthen Europe.\u201cIf it makes the National Front less of an alternative,\u201d he added, \u201cthere is no one here who will be unhappy about that.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Berlin and Liz Alderman from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Las Vegas Hopes Its Play to Land Pro Soccer Won\u2019t Be a Loser", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 From her glass office at the top of City Hall, Mayor Carolyn G. Goodman looked down at the transformation of this city\u2019s once-crumbling downtown, nodding toward new attractions \u2014 the eye-catching brain research center, the Mob Museum, the sprawling performing arts complex \u2014 as evidence that Sin City is no longer just about booze and blackjack.But Las Vegas is missing one essential ingredient, she said: major league professional sports.But the public has not yet embraced this vision of Las Vegas. Instead, residents have revolted against the prospect of paying for the stadium with tax dollars. Without millions in public money, it is unlikely that shovels will hit the dry ground on the $200 million project.The stadium\u2019s future now depends on a final City Council vote in December. Ms. Goodman has pleaded with residents to \u201cbelieve in Las Vegas,\u201d arguing that the vote is about the kind of city that Las Vegans want to have.\u201cWe want to be a formidable city that really draws people with all the extras \u2014 and all the basics,\u201d Ms. Goodman said in an interview. \u201cThis is the last piece.\u201dAfter three decades of vast growth \u2014 the city\u2019s population has tripled since 1985 \u2014 residents are ravenous for diversions that do not involve video poker. But many of them are still reeling from the recession that left a landscape of foreclosures and half-finished housing developments, and people say that more basic quality-of-life issues, like funding for schools and parks, are more important than a sports team.The public schools here are severely overcrowded, and park space is in such short supply that eight youth soccer teams have to share a single field for practice.The Nevada Youth Soccer Association has campaigned against spending public dollars on the soccer stadium, saying that the money should go toward new parks and fields for children.\u201cI\u2019m a soccer fanatic, but you have to make hard choices,\u201d said Lisa Mayo, a spokeswoman for the youth soccer association, who raised five children here. \u201cThe money should go to infrastructure that allows our kids to get exercise and teaches them the other intangibles that come with playing a sport.\u201dThe city does host a top-level minor league baseball team, the 51s. But for the mayor and her family, bringing major league professional sports to Las Vegas has become a crusade.For 12 years, Mr. Goodman tried to entice a team \u2014 any team \u2014 to Las Vegas. He courted baseball, basketball and hockey, but none bit. Then term limits forced him to leave office.His wife picked up the cause. \u201cThat was the only reason I ran for office, really,\u201d Ms. Goodman said. \u201cWe both believe in the formula for redeveloping cities: culture, medicine and major league sports.\u201dIn the past, Las Vegas had been a hard sell for sports teams, in part because leagues like the National Basketball Association did not want to be linked with gambling. That concern has eased somewhat as gambling has flourished on the Internet and casinos have popped up in other states.At the same time, competition from international gambling meccas like Macau have prodded Las Vegas officials to diversify the economy. In addition to the new museums and medical center, Zappos, an online shoe juggernaut, moved in downtown alongside the rows of casinos and adult video stores.\u201cVegas isn\u2019t Vegas anymore \u2014 it\u2019s more than just gambling,\u201d said Mike Tomko, a city firefighter who moved here from New York a decade ago. \u201cDowntown, they want to make it a world-class city.\u201dMr. Tomko, 56, said he still missed going to Yankees and Giants games. But he does not think Major League Soccer, with its growing but modest fan base, is bright and shiny enough to capture the attention in Las Vegas, where a team would have to compete with stars like Britney Spears or Garth Brooks nearly every night.\u201cVegas is very transient; getting a permanent fan base for any sport would be a hard call,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to bring in other businesses \u2014 regular businesses, insurance companies. Build a couple office buildings. I don\u2019t think M.L.S. is the answer.\u201dGiven the city\u2019s growth and changing demographics, however, officials from the city and Major League Soccer insist that pro soccer can work here. Latinos make up a third of the city\u2019s residents, and nearly half of the population is younger than 35 \u2014 both groups that have shown strong support for the sport.If it is built, the 24,000-seat stadium, complete with high-tech cooling systems to keep players and fans from roasting on 100-degree summer days, would occupy an empty 61-acre lot near the new performing arts center. Boosters say it would not only attract families and new businesses to the area, but also foster hometown pride in a city often defined by its 100,000 daily visitors.Jason Crank, a lifelong Las Vegan, said he would bring his 9-year-old son to games if the city had a professional team.\u201cGrowing up, it was always a challenge because we never had a team to root for,\u201d said Mr. Crank, a 30-year-old cabana host. \u201cYou looked towards the nearest cities for a team to root for. I think this could be a great thing for Las Vegans. We\u2019re definitely big enough.\u201dBut the stadium will be built only if the City Council approves a funding plan and Major League Soccer chooses Las Vegas as an expansion franchise for 2020, neither of which is guaranteed. Minneapolis and Sacramento are also vying to land the expansion team.Construction also began earlier this year on an indoor arena on the Strip, but there is no deal in place to bring in a team once it is completed, and the site may host mostly boxing matches and shows.And at the start of October, the City Council directed the downtown stadium\u2019s developers to explore whether it could be built without public funding. The mayor and one of the developers said in interviews that some public money would be necessary to make the project viable.Ultimately, the decision could come down to Lois Tarkanian, a City Council member whose family is synonymous with sports in Las Vegas. In 1990, her husband, Jerry Tarkanian, coached the University of Nevada-Las Vegas men\u2019s basketball team to its only national title.\u201cI think a successful franchise in any sport would pull the city closely together,\u201d Ms. Tarkanian said. \u201cWhen my husband was coaching, you couldn\u2019t go anyplace without someone talking about the team. Everyone was behind it. We\u2019re missing that feeling at the moment.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a tough decision \u2014 I feel the excitement it could bring,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do it this time, I can assure you it will happen in the near future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Advanced Course in Diversity", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMovie Review\u201cDear White People\u201d is also the title of a series of campus radio broadcasts and viral Internet videos concocted by one of the movie\u2019s major characters, a college student named Samantha White, played with heartbreaking poise by Tessa Thompson. Sam, as she is called, uses \u201cDear White People\u201d to call out the hypocrisies, blind spots and micro-aggressions that African-Americans experience in their daily encounters with well-meaning Caucasians. Such people, including many of her fellow undergraduates at the Ivier-than-Ivy League Winchester University, make up a big part of Sam\u2019s fan base. This is less because they want to subject themselves to her scolding than because they crave reassurance that they don\u2019t really need it. The eagerness of some whites to prove that they \u201cget it\u201d on matters of race \u2014 their clumsy appropriations of African-American idioms and pop-cultural forms \u2014 is one of the targets of Sam\u2019s critique and Mr. Simien\u2019s satire. And so, at least for this director, is the tendency of some black people to poke at that insecurity, and to engage one another in fierce battles about authenticity, appropriate conduct and political strategy. \u201cDear White People\u201d deals out a deck of race cards, most of them jokers. To change the metaphor, the film leads its characters and its viewers \u2014 pale-skinned critics very much included \u2014 down a path strewn with eggshells, some of which sit on top of land mines. Winchester is a hothouse of inflamed sensitivity and warring identities, populated mainly by young people who are eager to do the right thing as well as all the other things that college students usually do: drink beer, hook up, make friends, incubate careers and maybe even take a class or two. Like real-life American institutions of higher learning, this make-believe college strives to resolve painful and intractable social divisions, only to end up reproducing them on a smaller scale and in a more rarefied and intensified form.Sam\u2019s current lover, a teaching assistant in her film class, is also white, which may be why she keeps their relationship secret, tolerating the amorous attention of Reggie (Marque Richardson), her ally in militancy and, perhaps in her own mind, a more appropriate romantic partner. But the heart rarely obeys the imperatives of ideology, which can be confusing enough on their own. Sam\u2019s struggles are mirrored by those of two other African-American students seeking a way to fit in at Winchester while staying true to themselves. One is Coco (Teyonah Parris), who tries to set herself up, in web videos and in the way she dresses, talks and does her hair, as Sam\u2019s antithesis, an advocate of assimilation and upward mobility. She also wants to impress a reality-show producer who is sniffing around campus looking for provocative material.Not that anyone is let off the hook. \u201cDear White People\u201d does not point the way toward a happy, huggy, post-racial future. Nor does it prophesy a revolutionary fire next time. And it does not pretend that \u201crace\u201d is a symmetrical problem to be solved by acts of reciprocal good will on both sides. This is in part a movie about racism, about how deeply white supremacy is still embedded in institutions that congratulate themselves on their diversity and tolerance. It is, in other words, about how the distance from a place like Winchester to a place like Ferguson, Mo., is not as great as some of us might wish or suppose.Everyone should see this movie, and everyone will see it a little differently. Maybe you will think it goes too far, or not far enough. Since I happen to belong to the group to which it is explicitly addressed, a direct response seems warranted. Dear \u201cDear White People\u201d: Got your message. Keep in touch.\u201cDear White People\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

{"Headline": "Casino Plan Frays Ties Between Amish and Neighbors", "Date": "2014-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Buy-InTYRE, N.Y. \u2014 Ever since they settled in this tiny farm town along the New York State Thruway more than a decade ago, the Amish have been a benign, generally welcome presence: guiding their buggies down local roads, delivering fresh produce to their neighbors and paying their taxes \u2014 though they do not vote.But the possibility that a glittering casino could be built here, halfway between Syracuse and Rochester, has torn at the bonds that knit together the area\u2019s Amish and secular residents.Bishop Daniel Schwartz, 43, who raises corn, cows and chickens across a two-lane highway from the proposed casino site, has objected to the plan in simple but dogmatic terms. He is talking about pulling up stakes and leaving the region if the project becomes a reality. And he and some of the hundreds of other local Amish have mounted a primitive but potent public relations campaign, appearing silently in court, traveling to state hearings, stating their views in handwriting. In hopes of thwarting the project, Bishop Schwartz himself, wiry-whiskered and rosy-cheeked, even granted what he said was his first sit-down interview.\u201cGambling goes against the teaching of the Bible,\u201d Bishop Schwartz said, \u201cand the fruits of gambling are all bad.\u201dThe town leaders, however, are having none of this. Backed by regional leaders and deeply desirous of the jobs, tourism and municipal improvements that a casino could bring, the town supervisor and others have accused the Amish of allowing themselves to be used as sympathetic props to drum up opposition, exaggerating how threatening the plan would be to their way of life, and overstating their population in Tyre \u2014 as well as their importance to it.\u201cAs the old saying goes, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts,\u201d said Ronald F. McGreevy, the supervisor, who campaigned for the casino. He insisted that there were only a few Amish families in Tyre proper, which has a population of about 950. \u201cThere is certainly not going to be a mass exodus if this comes to fruition,\u201d Mr. McGreevy said. Clashes like the one in Tyre \u2014 perhaps the most colorful, given the cultural differences in the mix \u2014 have broken out across New York as the State Gaming Commission prepares to decide the location of up to four new casinos this fall. Expressions of local support were a requirement for each of the 16 proposals, and applicants have worked hard to demonstrate community ties: hosting job fairs, announcing business and labor partnerships, and trumpeting how residents could benefit. One bidder even promised a town new fire trucks.Standing in the way are opponents whose objections are often emotionally charged. Environmentalists are suing to stop a $1.5 billion project from Genting, the Malaysian casino company, over possible damage to a public forest in Tuxedo, in Orange County; leaders in Kiryas Joel, a Hasidic village in Orange County, sued over the feared impacts of two separate casinos; and opponents of a casino in East Greenbush, near Albany, accused leaders there of rigging the process by which its developer won the town\u2019s support.The plaintiffs all cite local officials in their complaints. But the lawsuits are also intended as a siren loud enough to be audible in the state capital.\u201cWe wanted to show the Gaming Commission that the town\u2019s show of community support was not so smooth and un-pockmarked as they might want it to look,\u201d said Rodger Friedman, a member of the group opposing the casino in Tuxedo. Economic issues are at the heart of the appeal of the $425 million Tyre project, called Lago, in an allusion to the nearby Finger Lakes: With thousands of slot machines, a 1,700-seat theater and a 207-room hotel, promising \u201cthe high energy and excitement of Las Vegas,\u201d its backers say it could pour millions of dollars of revenue into a town so small it has no post office.Today, the busiest commercial spot in Tyre is a truck stop off the Thruway. A municipal court shares space with a dog kennel. And the upkeep on the one-room hall used for civic events is partly paid for with barbecue fund-raisers and redemption of the deposits on recyclable cans.The casino legislation was promoted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as a way to help the upstate economy, and Mr. McGreevy said Lago would pay for better water, new Internet service and lower taxes, and would help stave off the need to consider dissolving the town altogether.\u201cTyre deserves a chance to survive,\u201d said Mr. McGreevy, a retired lawn-mower salesman whose town office is a converted bedroom in his home.The casino\u2019s developer promises Lago will create 1,800 permanent jobs, or nearly twice the town\u2019s current population. Regional supporters include the Seneca County Board of Supervisors; a collection of labor unions, arts organizations and business leaders; and Tyre\u2019s town board, which voted unanimously in favor of the casino plan in June.Defeated twice in court, the group has presented a vigorous opposition, in Albany, in protests at the casino site and in petitions blasting the town board for \u201cselling out to a casino developer.\u201dThe group contends that Tyre was chosen for a casino on a bet that the Amish, who do not vote, and its rural residents would put up little fight. Indeed, Casino Free Tyre styles itself as a defender of the Amish and others who have farmed in the area for generations, and has collected sympathetic statements from Amish leaders in nearby counties and communities.\u201cWe as leaders of our Old Order Amish group humbly ask youce not to let a casino be build\u201d in the area, reads one handwritten letter, signed by six Amish men representing two church districts, roughly equivalent to parishes.James Dawley, one of the founders of Casino Free Tyre, said he worried the casino might drive away the Amish and the quiet spirituality and wholesomeness they project.\u201cThey add a level of protection from, I guess you would say, what is a worldly influence to our town,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a protective barrier because of their faith.\u201dBut casino supporters say the objections of the Amish themselves have been exaggerated in an effort to turn the sect\u2019s piety, and its power as a symbol of old-time simplicity, into a kind of cudgel to be wielded against the casino project on behalf of other people who were simply against development.\u201cThey are being used, for lack of a better term,\u201d Mr. McGreevy said, \u201cby this small anti-casino group, saying if we do this, this casino is going to be the end of life as we know it.\u201dMr. McGreevy said the group\u2019s distortions included overstating the Amish population in Tyre, which he put at only four families, with perhaps six or seven members in each.Supporters also contend that the moral arguments against casinos, which once carried more of a stigma, have lost force as much of the country has legalized gambling in pursuit of budget relief.Apprised of Mr. McGreevy\u2019s remarks, the Amish bishop in Tyre, Bishop Schwartz, took the unusual step of agreeing to an interview.Asked for the number of Amish he ministers to, Bishop Schwartz said his community included six families with 44 people living in Tyre, but extended to a total of nearly 350 residents in the two districts included in his area.He said Tyre had been a nice spot for his family \u2014 he and his wife have six children, ages 13 to 23 \u2014 because of its rich, flat land, its wildlife, and \u201cgood neighbors.\u201dHis people work long, hard days, he said, waking at 5 a.m. to tend their crops and livestock, largely avoiding politics or public life. \u201cWe try to stay out of the way and try not to be a burden, to the government, to the town,\u201d he said. \u201cWe enjoy the countryside, and that\u2019s going to be it.\u201dBut Bishop Schwartz said he decided to speak out because of his profound worries about what a casino could bring: traffic, noise, bright lights and threats to what he called \u201cthe moral of the people.\u201d \u201cPeople that are spending this money in the casino are not going to have money to make payments to pay their taxes and to eat, and that\u2019s going to make people \u2014 they\u2019re going to get desperate for money,\u201d Bishop Schwartz said.His people are pacifists, he said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t look forward to having thieves in the middle of the night or people come knocking at the door,\u201d Bishop Schwartz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if those things will happen or not, but that\u2019s kind of a big concern.\u201dBishop Schwartz disputed the idea that the Amish were being manipulated by the casino\u2019s other adversaries. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel that way; we don\u2019t feel that they are using us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to head this off for their own good, if you will, and us too. We really appreciate it.\u201dThe tense debate has cast a pall over some public functions in Tyre, as each side has accused the other of shameful tactics. At a town board meeting in May, as several Amish people looked on, one supporter of the casino, Michael Davis, turned to them and asked why they had chosen this issue to break their long abstention from civic involvement.\u201cExcuse me, Amish, I think you\u2019re wonderful neighbors, and I think you\u2019re great people,\u201d said Mr. Davis, president of the Finger Lakes Building and Trades Council, which could benefit from the construction jobs that a casino would bring. \u201cBut I heard how you can\u2019t come to these things \u2014 and yet you\u2019re here. I heard how you can\u2019t go to court \u2014 and yet you were there.\u201dMr. Davis, who owns a farm nearby, added later that he felt the casino\u2019s potential effect on the town\u2019s rural character had been overstated. But Mr. McGreevey acknowledged that the heated debate already had one impact. \u201cWe\u2019ve got friends and neighbors now who don\u2019t speak,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve allocated the space at no charge,\u201d Mr. Wilmot said.But Bishop Schwartz seemed unmoved. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, with a small laugh.The Amish stopped attending town board meetings after Mr. Davis\u2019s speech. But a group of them traveled to a public hearing on the Tyre casino proposal in Ithaca last month \u2014 raising questions, again, about how they had gotten there.Bishop Schwartz said they had paid their own way, and that the questions had prompted him to write another letter expressing his opposition. But he said he was already mulling the possibility that Lago would be approved.Would that constitute enough of a threat for the Amish to pack up and go?\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Bishop Schwartz said. But he added, \u201cCan\u2019t imagine living so close to a casino.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article incorrectly characterized the intent of a political yard sign.

{"Headline": "Next Hurdle for Greece's Economy: Its Own Political Uncertainty", "Date": "2014-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeBRUSSELS \u2014 Greece is not giving European leaders sleepless nights again, but as the eurozone\u2019s problem child approaches the end of its second international bailout, political uncertainty in Athens is set to test the currency area\u2019s resilience.The disclosure in late 2009 that Greece had cheated on its figures to conceal a huge budget deficit set off a rolling crisis that nearly tore apart Europe\u2019s monetary union.Although there are timid signs that the Greek economy may have turned a corner after receiving 240 billion euros, or $304 billion at current exchange rates, in bailout funds, the political center may not hold much longer. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras won a vote of confidence from the Greek Parliament for his flagging right-left government on Friday, but political analysts say a snap election will probably be called for March that could propel the radical leftist Syriza party to power.It would be the first time a movement deeply hostile to a European Union-International Monetary Fund bailout program takes hold in Europe, sweeping aside center-left and center-right establishment parties tainted by having implemented harsh austerity measures.Syriza\u2019s charismatic leader, Alexis Tsipras, says he would reverse some of those policies and demand that international lenders write off some of Greece\u2019s giant \u20ac318.6 billion debt, 85 percent of which is owed to foreign governments and the I.M.F.Yet the radical leftists\u2019 arrival in power would not unleash the same panic now that it would have in June 2012, when Syriza appeared on the brink of a breakthrough.Early elections will be called if Mr. Samaras is unable to find 180 lawmakers to elect a new president in February. His coalition has 155 deputies, and none of the 23 independent deputies sided with him in the confidence vote.Trailing Syriza in opinion polls, Mr. Samaras\u2019s conservative New Democracy party hopes to cast off the stigma of intrusive supervision by the so-called troika of official creditors \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the I.M.F. \u2014 at the end of the year.Mr. Samaras is willing to forgo the last \u20ac12 billion of I.M.F. funds due in 2015-16 to escape quarterly review visits by the troika. Instead, he aims to borrow some of the money on the markets and is expected to tap a fund set aside for bank rescues.However, the I.M.F., the European Union and the paymaster Germany are eager to keep Athens under surveillance with a precautionary credit line as a safety net to underpin a return to market funding.Christine Lagarde, the head of the I.M.F., said recently that Greece\u2019s outlook had improved considerably but that the country would be \u201cin a better position\u201d if it had precautionary support and a continuing relationship with her organization.Greece is set to run a primary budget surplus before interest payments for the second successive year in 2014 and is finally seeing a timid return of growth after six years of severe recession that shrank the economy by a quarter since 2008.But with unemployment still at more than 26 percent, and twice that level among young people, most Greeks have not felt any benefit from the feeble recovery so far. Anger and protests have turned to resignation, and in some cases to despair: The country has been scarred by a rash of public suicides at national landmarks. International lenders led by Germany are eager to help Mr. Samaras survive in government as long as possible to avert the risk of turbulence under a Syriza-led administration.If his coalition with the remains of the once mighty center-left Pasok party runs its full term, it could hang on until June 2016, by which time recovery might be more tangible for voters.But Berlin has put out discreet feelers to Mr. Tsipras in hopes of moderating the onetime firebrand if he does come to power.The German deputy labor minister, J\u00f6rg Asmussen, a former E.C.B. executive board member, has met with Mr. Tsipras at least three times, and the opposition leader has also met with the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi.Despite Mr. Tsipras\u2019s demands, European Union officials insist that Greece does not need a debt write-off, which would be politically explosive in creditor countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.Private bondholders took major losses in 2012, so any additional debt relief would likely involve a further extension of repayment deadlines on official debt, the officials say.While the I.M.F. has to be repaid within 10 years, the average maturity on European loans to Athens is already 32 years, with a 10-year stay on interest payments at a rate of just 1.5 percent.Greece\u2019s debt-servicing costs are lower now than before the crisis even though its debt mountain has swelled to 178 percent of national output \u2014 far above the 124 percent that the troika defined as a sustainable level by 2020.Miranda Xafa, an expert on Greek debt and a former member of the I.M.F.\u2019s executive board, said Athens would need to raise \u20ac10 billion in the bond market next year, which may not be so easy if there is political uncertainty.That assumes it will be able to gain access to all of the \u20ac11 billion reserve in the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund set aside to recapitalize banks, depending on the outcome of the E.C.B.\u2019s review of bank balance sheets to be published this month.\u201cI don't think either the I.M.F. or the European Commission is likely to let Greece have a \u2018clean exit\u2019 like Ireland or Portugal,\u201d Ms. Xafa said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tokyo's Soft Power Problem", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe more Japan\u2019s global relevance in economic, political and military terms seems to decline, the more it cares about projecting soft power. The government\u2019s \u201cCool Japan\u201d project subsidizes \u201cattractive products or services\u201d that, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, \u201cmake full use of the unique characteristics of Japanese culture and lifestyle.\u201d These include decorative washi paper, a cosplay-inspired clothing brand and a bonsai plant grown with renewable energy. Despite this concern, both the Japanese government and the Japanese people seem unaware of the global impact of Japan\u2019s most successful cultural export to date: the so-called Suzuki Method of music instruction.Originally conceived in the 1930s by the violinist Shinichi Suzuki, the Suzuki Method proposes that all children can learn to play an instrument as naturally as they learn to speak their native language. According to the Talent Education Research Institute, an educational organization founded by Mr. Suzuki, about 400,000 children in 46 countries are now learning to play musical instruments the Suzuki way. But just 20,000 of them are Japanese. As the institute puts it, the method \u201chas earned high acclaim overseas, more so than at home.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the Japanese seem to miss what of theirs is worth celebrating and need to be told by outsiders. Ukiyo-e woodblock prints were used as wrapping paper for export wares when Japan began trading with the Western world in the second half of the 19th century. They were soon \u201cdiscovered\u201d by European Impressionist painters, who hailed them as a distinct art form. Modern Japan has repeatedly overlooked the merits of its own artistic and cultural production out of a blinding insecurity about its international standing. The Suzuki pedagogy was misunderstood from its very beginnings in the 1930s. Upon returning to Tokyo from Berlin, where he had spent most of his twenties, Mr. Suzuki found himself in high demand as a teacher. His first young pupils were conspicuously more skilled than others at the time \u2014 when classical musicians of any age were rare in Japan \u2014 and were soon heralded by the Japanese media as prodigies and geniuses. Mr. Suzuki abhorred such terms. He believed that the sheer joy of making music or learning just about anything was accessible to all children. There was a pastoral element to his approach: Its main goal was not to mass-produce professional musicians but rather to mold individuals into sensitive and thoughtful human beings with \u201cnoble hearts.\u201d In \u201cPowerful Education,\u201d published in September 1941, Mr. Suzuki called for reforming Japan\u2019s educational system; he argued that teachers were too quick to give up on children who lagged behind. He stressed the importance while, say, learning to play the violin of goal-setting, encouragement and repetition.But this was too bold a proposal for the time. The Japanese empire had already embarked on its ill-conceived expansionist path, having started a war with China in 1937. Some of Mr. Suzuki\u2019s young students were called unpatriotic for playing music during a national emergency.In this oppressive atmosphere, the kind of sweeping change Mr. Suzuki envisioned, which required re-educating the educators, did not go down well. As Japan was beginning to lose yet another war it had started, this one against the United States and its allies, he wrote another book urging elementary school reform. The authorities prevented its publication.The war eventually ended and then, in March 1955, less than 10 years after Japan\u2019s utter defeat, Mr. Suzuki gathered some 1,200 children in a gymnasium in Tokyo. Black-and-white footage shows the 56-year-old Suzuki doing some lithe footwork on a makeshift podium and waving his bow like a wizard\u2019s wand as he conducts the young violinists through difficult pieces, including Bach\u2019s Double Concerto.News of this group concert, the first Suzuki performance to attract national attention, reached the United States. American instructors traveled to Mr. Suzuki\u2019s music school in Matsumoto, a scenic mountain town, hoping to discover the secrets of this Japanese miracle.That concert was deemed all the more remarkable in the United States for seeming incongruous, because it featured Japanese children playing Western instruments. What\u2019s more, had those young Japanese been born a few years earlier, they could easily have been among the soldiers American forces had fought. The Suzuki children represented the rebirth of a softer, gentler kind of Japan.The rest of the world eventually took to the method because it worked. Starting in 1963, Mr. Suzuki regularly toured the United States with his Japanese students, stopping at the United Nations headquarters and Carnegie Hall. The Japanese government had little to do with this cross-cultural dissemination: Much of it was the work of Mr. Suzuki and his supporters, including Masaru Ibuka, Sony\u2019s co-founder and himself a great early-childhood education advocate. By the 1970s, the Suzuki Method had become a worldwide phenomenon. Even in remote areas of India and Indonesia, places with no properly trained music teachers, people were learning to play instruments on their own, thanks to Suzuki-compiled repertoires of incremental difficulty.In June 1979, when President Jimmy Carter visited Japan with his family, his daughter Amy had a group lesson with Mr. Suzuki\u2019s niece, Hiroko Suzuki (the current president of the Talent Education Research Institute). At a time of heightening U.S.-Japanese trade friction, the episode marked a diplomatic success. Yet Mr. Suzuki was unsuccessful in his attempts to convince successive Japanese prime ministers to incorporate his approach in public education. In Japan, his method continued to be seen as a program for the exceptionally gifted.Japan\u2019s long failure to claim as its own a globally attractive philosophy like Mr. Suzuki\u2019s reveals its chronic inability to see what is \u201ccool\u201d about itself. This stands in stark contrast to Venezuela\u2019s publicly funded music education program El Sistema. That method also celebrates the idea that music can change the lives of children from diverse backgrounds. The parallel is not surprising since Takeshi Kobayashi brought the Suzuki Method to Venezuela in the late 1970s, teaching a group of underprivileged children to play in an orchestra. But unlike the Japanese government, the Venezuelan government has consistently funded this cultural endeavor since the mid-1970s. The El Sistema movement is even making inroads in Japan. The Soma Children\u2019s Orchestra and Chorus was established after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami ravaged the northeastern part of Japan, to encourage children there to make music communally. Now Japanese are taking up El Sistema: They recognize the merits of the method because it is dressed in exotic garb, unaware that it has long been in their midst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Workers Demand $15 Wage in Several Protests", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs retail workers step up demands for higher wages and more stable working hours, a trade organization has warned that many retailers cannot afford to pay more, intensifying a debate over fair pay in a struggling industry.Labor activists have long denounced retailers like Walmart for employing an army of low-wage, part-time workers to staff their stores. As retail sales flounder in an uncertain economy, those activists \u2014 and even a growing number of retailers \u2014 are linking those sluggish sales to the retailers\u2019 own low wages.\u201cI can\u2019t afford anything,\u201d said LaRanda Jackson, 20, who earns $8.75 an hour working on the sales floor at a Walmart in Cincinnati. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t afford soap, toothpaste, tissue. Sometimes I have to go without washing my clothes.\u201dMs. Jackson was among 14 Walmart employees and 12 others who were arrested and charged with civil disobedience Thursday after staging a protest outside the Manhattan residence of Alice Walton, an heir to the Walmart fortune, demanding that Walmart set a base pay of $15 for all its workers \u2014 much like the demands of the fast-growing movement of fast-food workers.But the National Retail Federation, a retail industry group, has resisted demands for a higher minimum wage. Given the tough winds facing the industry, the group said this week, raising the minimum wage would simply eat away at many retailers\u2019 bottom lines, and ultimately threaten retail jobs.The federation argued that retail workers earn above-average pay if temporary workers, including those hired for holiday sales, are excluded. Retail workers ages 25 to 54 who work full time for at least three consecutive months make an average of $38,376 a year, slightly more than full-time workers in nonretail jobs, the group said.\u201cNow is not the right time to be mandating a minimum-wage increase,\u201d the federation\u2019s president, Matthew R. Shay, said in a briefing Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019d rather much be focusing on what do we need to be doing to stimulate growth.\u201dWalmart also stressed that many of its workers were quickly prompted to better-paying jobs. \u201cAt Walmart, it doesn\u2019t take too long to advance beyond the minimum wage level,\u201d said Kory Lundberg, a spokesman for Walmart.He said that Walmart had promoted 170,000 people last year to jobs with higher pay. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a very important debate, but starting wage isn\u2019t the main issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main issue is the opportunity you have to grow and advance and take home higher pay.\u201dAnd speaking to reporters after a conference call Wednesday, Douglas McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, stressed that less than 6,000 workers of its American work force of 1.3 million currently made the minimum wage, and that the retailer intended to eventually move them off that wage level.Still, Ms. Jackson, 20, who has worked at Walmart for 15 months and supports her mother and four brothers on her salary, said that low hourly wages weren\u2019t the only problem. She was sometimes assigned as little as 25 hours a week, greatly reducing her take-home pay, she said.With Thursday\u2019s protests, the Walmart protesters borrowed several publicity-winning ideas from the fast-food movement: engaging in civil disobedience and holding protests in media centers, like New York and Washington. The Walmart protests also adopted the fast-food workers\u2019 call for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. That demand helped push Seattle to enact a $15 minimum wage while San Francisco is considering one.Labor strategists had voiced frustration in recent months that the campaign to raise wages at Walmart was getting far less attention and traction than the movement of fast-food workers.The Walmart demonstrators have sought to turn up the pressure by personalizing their campaign \u2014 holding protests outside the Arizona home of Rob Walton, Walmart\u2019s chairman, and the Park Avenue apartment of Ms. Walton, his sister. Both are large Walmart shareholders and children of Sam Walton, the company\u2019s founder. The demonstrators also protested at an office of the Walton Family Foundation in Washington.A number of retailers are now rethinking what they pay their workers. Ikea, the home furnishings giant, said in June that it would raise the minimum wage at all its United States stores starting next year, with average base pay for an Ikea employee rising to $10.76 an hour.Gap also raised minimum hourly pay for workers across all of its brands to $9 in June, and said that workers will receive at least $10 an hour in June 2015. The company said in a statement at the time that the move would have a \u201cpositive impact\u201d on its employees and was \u201cgood for business.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple. When Americans don\u2019t have disposable income, retailers don\u2019t have customers,\u201d Brendan V. Duke, a policy analyst at the center, said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s time for retailers and the rest of corporate America to connect the dots and realize the only way our economy can sustain consumer demand is by giving their workers a raise.\u201dAn article on Friday about a debate over pay for workers in the retailing industry misstated, in some copies, part of the name of an industry trade organization that has warned against raising the minimum wage. The group is the National Retail Federation, not National Retail Foundation.Steven Greenhouse contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Government Holds Firm in Germany in Face of Weakening Economy", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE German economy is weakening, as a new European credit scare seems to be arriving. But the German government and central bank seem to see no reason to do anything to stimulate the economy.This week, the German Economy Ministry shaved its forecasts of economic growth, and the government reported that manufacturing in August was 2.4 percent below the level a year earlier. A survey of manufacturing firms found that in September more of them reported that new orders were falling than said orders were gaining. Not since late 2012 had that survey been so negative.This week, the widely watched ZEW survey of financial market experts indicated that more of them expected the German economy to decline over the next six months than expected it to improve. Earlier this year, a vast majority of them were optimistic, as Germany seemed to be growing at an adequate rate even as other European countries were struggling.Now, however, interest rates on government bonds in some European areas are rising rapidly, as investors lose confidence that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, will be able and willing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to spur growth and keep a new crisis from arriving. Many had expected that Mr. Draghi would unveil a new initiative at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, and there had been speculation that Germany might opt for some fiscal stimulation as its own economy began to sputter. But Mr. Draghi has had little to say, and Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, was reported to have ruled out stimulus at a meeting of the governing Christian Democratic Party. The decline in manufacturing reported this week may reflect changes this year in vacation schedules in Germany, but figures for other countries were also weak, with manufacturing output falling in France and Finland and remaining level with a year earlier in Italy.Over all, industrial production, which also includes production of energy and mining, was down 3.1 percent in Germany on a year-over-year basis. That dragged the overall eurozone to a decline of 0.8 percent. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, said the disappointing numbers \u201cadd to the chances that the eurozone could see a drop in G.D.P. in the third quarter after G.D.P. stagnated in the second quarter.\u201dIn a speech to the American Council on Germany in Chicago this week, Andreas Dombret, a member of the executive board of the Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, pointed to the weakening economic statistics but did not counsel that either fiscal or monetary policies should be used to stimulate economies.Instead, he focused on the need to make it easier to do business in Europe, including making it easier for employers to hire and fire workers. \u201cTo me,\u201d he said, \u201cthere can be no doubt. For the euro area to take off, we need to follow through on structural reforms.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Afghan Leader, Putting Focus on Graft, Revives Bank Fraud Inquiry", "Date": "2014-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Signaling his intent to improve the Afghan government\u2019s poor reputation on corruption, President Ashraf Ghani on Wednesday ordered a new examination of the stagnant Kabul Bank fraud prosecutions.The bank, likened to a roughly $800 million Ponzi scheme after powerful insiders pillaged it through fraudulent loans, has come to symbolize the legal impunity enjoyed by Afghanistan\u2019s elite. And the case has become a major sticking point for donor nations and the International Monetary Fund, which at one point made prosecution of those responsible for the bank\u2019s collapse a condition of any new loans to the government.Just three days into Mr. Ghani\u2019s presidency, his decree about the bank was clearly meant to reassure Western partners that aid to the country would not be a bad investment. The day before, as Afghanistan signed long-term security deals with the United States and NATO, Mr. Ghani had emphasized the importance of international aid in tackling \u201cshared challenges.\u201dIn his aggressively worded decree, Mr. Ghani ordered the detention of the convicted and a review of the case by the Afghan Supreme Court with the possibility of expanding charges. It was unclear, however, whether the judiciary could expand the list of defendants beyond the scope of the original prosecution.The order issued tight timelines for action, including three days to detain those whose appeals are pending, a month and a half for the Supreme Court to produce its findings and 10 days to work out cooperation agreements with countries where the stolen money may have been sent. It also explicitly directed the Attorney General\u2019s office, which some Afghan and Western officials have accused of shielding people who benefited from the fraud, to cooperate with the investigation.But even as numerous Western and Afghan officials applauded Mr. Ghani\u2019s move, some noted that for now it was only a gesture.It remains to be seen how the government will meet its deadlines and how the case will be pursued beyond the initial push. The major question is whether the list of defendants will grow to include more politically connected people who were not prosecuted despite facing serious fraud accusations \u2014 including Mahmood Karzai, former President Hamid Karzai\u2019s brother, and Haseen Fahim, the brother of the deceased Vice President Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim.\u201cToday\u2019s action matches Ghani\u2019s rhetoric about stanching out corruption, but there are a couple of questions looming,\u201d said one Western official who has followed the case closely, who like others interviewed about the case spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. \u201cThe real litmus test of this decree is whether all of the shareholders who weren\u2019t indicted are indicted.\u201dThe reopening of the case also risked further penalties for regulators whose efforts to clean up the mess at the bank were punished by prosecutions ordered at the highest levels of the Afghan government. A number of regulators are among the 21 people already convicted, and seeing them jailed would be \u201cthe definition of a miscarriage of justice,\u201d said another Western official familiar with the case.\u201cThese people were prosecuted in retribution, not because they were complicit,\u201d the official added.One important step toward a reckoning on Kabul Bank may come on Thursday, with the release by a Western-funded anticorruption body of a comprehensive list of names and amounts of people who benefited from the fraud.The Monitoring and Evaluation Committee, which conducted a public inquiry into the scandal in 2012, will release its report, \u201cUnfinished Business,\u201d which names every beneficiary of the Kabul Bank scandal, the amount of money each received, and how much each did \u2014 or did not \u2014 repay.\u201cYou cannot find a better case to prove how impunity prevails in Afghanistan,\u201d said Drago Kos, a member of the committee who is also chairman of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s Working Group on Bribery. \u201cThe Afghan people lost a lot of money in Kabul Bank, and nobody has been held responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as this is the case, they will not trust their government.\u201dMr. Kos said the report listed 19 companies and individuals, from a private airline to Mahmood Karzai, with debts totaling $880 million. It also lists assets purchased with the fraudulent loans, including 11 villas in Dubai, a complex of 108 shops and 34 apartments in Kabul, seven planes for the airline and an oil storage complex with 50 vehicles.In a reflection of the difficulty of the work, the anticorruption group delayed its publication until after President Karzai had stepped down because \u201cwe were sure that the previous president would do nothing,\u201d Mr. Kos said.The Afghan vice president\u2019s office had already pressured a tribunal not to pursue some of the main beneficiaries of the fraud, including Mr. Karzai\u2019s brother, according to Mr. Kos. Other Afghan officials said Mr. Karzai also interfered with the tribunal. Mahmood Karzai\u2019s lawyers later served Mr. Kos with a libel summons, apparently in a bid to stop his work, Mr. Kos said.The crisis centered on a web of fraudulent insider loans, which went mostly to bank shareholders, who often had powerful political connections. Mahmood Karzai, for instance, borrowed $22 million, while Haseen Fahim borrowed $78 million.The bank had more than a million depositors, many of whom were public service employees. When the bank collapsed, the Afghan government assumed losses of more than $800 million \u2014 a bill ultimately absorbed by Western donors who had been bankrolling the Afghan economy since 2001.An article on Oct. 2 about a new examination ordered by Afghanistan\u2019s new president, Ashraf Ghani, of a fraud case involving the Kabul Bank referred incorrectly to pressure that was said to have been applied to a tribunal created to investigate the fraud. Drago Kos, a member of a committee that conducted an inquiry into the banking scandal, initially blamed \u201cthe presidency\u201d for the interference; he later said that he had been referring to the Afghan vice president\u2019s office, not that of President Hamid Karzai.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Bigger Stage, Walker Must Win Wisconsin", "Date": "2014-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGREEN BAY, Wis. \u2014 In June 2012, the morning after Scott Walker became the first governor ever to survive a recall election, the talk of higher office began in earnest.But that was then.Now Mr. Walker, 46, finds himself in a political corner, locked in a rough fight to hold on to his job. But as he battles Mary Burke \u2014 a Democrat who was once the state\u2019s commerce secretary, appointed by former Gov. Jim Doyle, but barely known statewide until this campaign \u2014 Mr. Walker\u2019s day job is not all that is at stake. His currency as a presidential contender will surely vanish if he cannot win a second term as the governor of Wisconsin.Even as Republicans are buoyed by hopes of retaking the United States Senate, Mr. Walker has his back to the wall. So intense is the fight that the governor, who defined himself by clashing with labor unions, is pressing to get his political base to the polls. In a state that twice has picked Barack Obama, Mr. Walker might have pursued a more centrist strategy. Instead, he is talking tough, as he did the other day here in Green Bay, pacing around a truck garage, laying out his plan to drug test people seeking food stamps or unemployment benefits.\u201cNow, in Madison, they howled the other day,\u201d Mr. Walker said of the state\u2019s left-leaning capital. \u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, the governor is making it harder to get government assistance.\u2019 I said: \u2018No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m making it easier to get a job.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that what it\u2019s really all about?\u201dThe contest here is really all about this state\u2019s sharp right turn over the past four years under Mr. Walker\u2019s leadership, Wisconsin\u2019s economy and Mr. Walker himself.In a way, this election is a final exam for the policy laboratory Mr. Walker has created, including cutting collective bargaining rights for public-sector unions and eliminating $2 billion in taxes.\u201cThe largest issue is the economic slide that Wisconsin has not been able to recover from,\u201d said Joanne Grunau, a voter who lives in Milwaukee, and sees the state\u2019s economy looming over the race. Mr. Walker promised four years ago to bring 250,000 new jobs to Wisconsin during his first term, but closer to 110,000, by some counts, have materialized.Ms. Grunau said she was among those who opposed efforts two years ago to remove Mr. Walker from office. \u201cTo me, a recall should be for an impeachable offense, something horrible, not just that you don\u2019t like the person,\u201d she said. This time, she plans to vote for Ms. Burke. \u201cI think she may be the person who can help us out of this,\u201d she said.Mr. Walker, a former state legislator and county executive, was elected governor in 2010 as part of a national Republican wave that also flipped control of this state\u2019s Legislature to Republicans.Within weeks of taking office, Mr. Walker announced that he needed to solve a budget deficit by cutting benefits and bargaining rights for most public-sector workers. In a state more accustomed to polite discussions across partisan lines, thousands of protesters marched outside his office for weeks; Democratic lawmakers fled the state to avoid a vote; and a series of back-and-forth recall efforts, including the one against Mr. Walker, followed.\u201cWe have been good stewards of the state,\u201d said Scott L. Fitzgerald, the State Senate majority leader.Not long ago, at a women\u2019s luncheon inside a Milwaukee community center, Ms. Burke went over an agenda that might well have been boiled down this way: I will do the opposite of Mr. Walker.Ms. Burke, who is 55 and whose only previous political campaign secured a seat on Madison\u2019s school board, has said she favors raising the minimum wage; accepting the federal Medicaid expansion that Mr. Walker rejected; stopping an expansion of school vouchers; and restoring collective bargaining, though not reversing requirements Mr. Walker set that public workers contribute more for benefits.By far, the economy is what Ms. Burke talks about most. \u201cRight now, under Governor Walker, we\u2019re dead last in the Midwest in terms of job creation while he has been in office,\u201d Ms. Burke told the lunch group as a PowerPoint presentation of her economic plan flashed on a screen beside her.Mr. Walker routinely uses a football metaphor to explain why he failed to meet his jobs promise. \u201cWhen I took over for Wisconsin it was like inheriting a team that was 0 and 16 and I promised that we\u2019d go to the Super Bowl,\u201d Mr. Walker says. \u201cWe\u2019re not at the Super Bowl yet. I\u2019m asking for a four-year contract renewal to get there. But we\u2019re winning again.\u201d If the appeal of Mr. Walker, who is the son of a preacher and left college without graduating, is his earnest, regular-guy ability to win a room, Ms. Burke\u2019s is her r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Georgetown, Harvard Business School and time in the private sector, including at the Trek Bicycle company her father founded.Ms. Burke, who is single and has contributed enough of her own money to her campaign to be teased by critics as \u201cMillionaire Mary,\u201d seems untroubled by the notion that she comes off more like a reserved chief executive officer holding a meeting than a polished politician rallying the troops. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this hyperpartisan atmosphere that we see today is who we really are here in Wisconsin,\u201d she said in an interview.In an interview, Mr. Walker said he and his wife, Tonette, were looking forward to the prospect of a \u201ctrue four-year term,\u201d not another one interrupted by a recall. \u201cIt would be nice to get things done,\u201d Mr. Walker said. But asked whether that meant he has ruled out running for president, Mr. Walker demurred. \u201cI never in my life \u2014 in the Assembly, as county executive, or now as governor \u2014 set exact terms, but my plan is for the next four years to be getting Wisconsin even more on track,\u201d he said.Few are more aware of the stakes of this race than Democrats here. \u201cIf we beat him here, that\u2019s it \u2014 game over,\u201d said Chris Larson, the minority leader in the State Senate. \u201cTicket-splitting used to be a tradition in this state,\u201d he said, \u201cbut with what\u2019s happened, now everyone is kind of straight down the line. That\u2019s the real upshot of 2010.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs Report Highlights the Wage Growth Puzzle", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecovery in Need of RecoveryThe latest round of labor market data released Friday add to an emerging puzzle whose resolution will be central to the future of the recovery.We learned that employment is growing at a healthy clip, with 248,000 jobs created this month, and an average of 220,000 jobs created each month over the past year. Moreover, unemployment has fallen both further and faster than most had anticipated. The latest reading suggests that unemployment is down to 5.9 percent, and has fallen about a full percentage point in each of the past three years. These are all symptoms of a healthy economic expansion.Normally, this would lead to faster wage growth. When workers feel their jobs are secure, they\u2019re better positioned to ask for a raise. Likewise, when there are fewer people unemployed, companies need to pay better wages in order to attract talented workers.Yet average hourly wages in the private sector were roughly flat in September (they fell by a penny), and they\u2019ve grown at a rate of only around 2 percent over the past year. Alternative indicators also suggest that wage growth remains subdued.This puzzle isn\u2019t entirely new, as the usual link between unemployment and the rate of wage growth has totally broken down over recent years.\u200bThe recent data have made a sharp departure from the usual textbook analysis in which a tighter labor market leads to faster wage growth, and subsequent cost pressures feed through to higher inflation. Even as the recession threw millions of people out of work, wage growth barely slowed despite the textbook prediction to the contrary. Then through the ensuing recovery, unemployment fell rapidly, but again, wage growth has barely moved.By the usual analysis, the key variable is how much \u201cslack\u201d there is in the labor market. When unemployment gets too low \u2014 toward what economists call the \u201cnatural rate\u201d (don\u2019t be fooled, there\u2019s nothing natural about it) \u2014 there\u2019s no more slack, and inflationary pressures start to build. This is the key reason the Federal Reserve has historically been nervous about keeping its foot pressed on the accelerator when unemployment got this low.Given how starkly the latest episode has deviated from historical patterns, the wisdom of relying on past patterns repeating themselves seems questionable.Rather than guessing whether the labor market has run out of slack, why not look for more direct evidence? Perhaps we should be using current rates of wage growth to infer whether the economy is nearly out of slack. By this view, the expansion has still got quite a way to run.To get a sense for this, realize that businesses will feel the need to start raising prices faster only if wage growth starts to exceed the rate of inflation, plus the rate of productivity growth. Given that the Fed is targeting inflation of 2 percent, and productivity typically grows at 1 to 2 percent, this suggests we should infer that the economy is about out of slack only when wage growth hits 3 to 4 percent.The fact that the labor market isn\u2019t delivering wage growth anywhere near this danger zone suggests that there remains a lot of slack left in the economy.While many workers are no doubt frustrated that they\u2019re not seeing wage gains, there\u2019s a sunnier implication in all this for the jobless. Subdued wage growth is telling policy makers it would be premature to hang the \u201cmission accomplished\u201d banner above this recovery. We can do a lot better than an economy in which 9.3 million people remain unemployed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Union Asks Britain to Pay Extra $2.7 Billion", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Cameron quickly rejected the demand as \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201dThe request for the money, which is about 1.7 billion pounds, came after a recalculation of data showed that the British economy performed better in recent years than previously thought. That suggested that its payments into the European Union budget should rise according to the bloc\u2019s formula for contributions. The payment would come in addition to Britain\u2019s annual payment of about $13.8 billion to the bloc\u2019s treasury.Speaking at a news briefing at a European Union summit meeting in Brussels, Mr. Cameron described the additional fee as \u201cunjustified\u201d and said Britain would refuse to pay it.\u201cIf people think I am paying that on Dec. 1 \u2014 no, that is not happening,\u201d said Mr. Cameron, who added that European finance ministers would meet to review the calculations used to come up with what he called a \u201cvast\u201d sum of taxpayers\u2019 money.The British leader described Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy as saying that the cash claim was a \u201clethal weapon\u201d used by European Union officials \u201cwithout a heart or a soul.\u201dIn theory, the extra contribution should be paid by Dec. 1, although Britain will most likely seek to delay and reduce the amount. Mr. Cameron has promised that he will renegotiate the terms of British membership in the European Union if he is re-elected next year, and that he will then hold a referendum in 2017 on whether to stay in the bloc.For the prime minister, the timing and nature of the budget dispute could hardly be worse. He has tried to convince Britons that he has already made headway on overhauling the European Union, in part by insisting that it reduce overall spending.The populist U.K. Independence Party, which campaigns against immigration and for a British exit from the union, seized on the budget news.Jonathan Arnott, a party member of the European Parliament, called the demand for the additional payment \u201coutrageous.\u201dIn a statement on Friday, the Liberal Democrats, the junior partner in the governing coalition, said they did not think the new assessment was justified. \u201cWe will work with other parties and countries that have just been landed with similar bills to challenge this,\u201d they said.Greece, Italy and the Netherlands are also scheduled to see their contributions rise, while France and Germany would get refunds.Within the Conservative Party, which fears that it will lose voters to the U.K. Independence Party, the demand provoked anger. John Redwood, a former minister, told the BBC that the demand \u201coffended all our principles of natural justice and fair taxation\u201d and was \u201ca very large increase in tax on the British people charged retrospectively without their agreement.\u201dThe revision took place after the European Commission, the executive arm of the bloc, reviewed the economic performance of all member states since 1995 and changed its statistics to take into account elements such as the underground economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Jean Tirole\u2019s Work Helps Explain the Internet Economy", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket RealitiesIn 2002, two years before Google went public or Facebook was founded, he wrote that Internet-era companies operate as two-sided platforms, with consumers on one side and software developers or advertisers on the other. Even if tech entrepreneurs have never read his work, they are referencing it when they throw around words like \u201cplatform\u201d and \u201cnetwork effect.\u201dHe also said that industries should be regulated differently depending on their distinct characteristics. Many Internet companies, for instance, give their products away free, which means that antitrust law built on pricing is irrelevant. But a result is they grow so fast that they can quickly become monopolies.In the tech industry, it explains why Google, Facebook and Twitter offer their services free \u2013 the more people who use them, the more advertisers they can attract. Likewise, Amazon lowered the price of its new phone to 99 cents in part because smartphones succeed when they have a lot of apps \u2013 and developers won\u2019t want to build apps for Amazon\u2019s phone unless a lot of people are using it.As Mr. Tirole wrote about another type of technology, video games, \u201cBuyers of video game consoles want games to play on; game developers pick platforms that are or will be popular among gamers.\u201dFor regulators, tech companies have been a riddle in part because they do not follow the behavior of typical monopolies: Many do not charge for their products, and companies that offer entirely different products are nonetheless competitors. For instance, Google\u2019s chairman, Eric Schmidt, argued in a speech on Monday that Google\u2019s biggest competitor in search is Amazon and in mobile is Facebook \u2014 even though neither one is a search engine.Two-sided markets, like that of a search engine, have a tendency to become monopolies, Mr. Tirole has written, but the dangers are different and harder to see than in traditional monopolies \u2013 like whether a monopoly\u2019s power prevents new start-ups from emerging. That is one of the elements antitrust authorities considered during investigations of Google.\u201cInspired by him and others like him, our effort was to try to move beyond the traditional understanding of something like an aluminum cartel who just raised their prices on aluminum and everything got more expensive,\u201d said Mr. Wu, who was a senior adviser to the Federal Trade Commission on antitrust matters.\u201cIt was really hard to understand market power and the traditional obsession with prices when everything is free,\u201d he said. \u201cBut of course they\u2019re not free. The costs are somewhere else.\u201dFor consumers, the costs include absorbing advertisers\u2019 ad spending by paying more for their products, being tracked and shown personalized ads, and giving up privacy.\u201cPeople say, \u2018I\u2019m a user of Facebook,\u2019 but in reality what you are is a supplier to Facebook,\u201d Mr. Gans said. \u201cThey give you in-kind services and then use the fact that you\u2019re there to sell their actual product to advertisers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Radio Dusts Off Mistletoe, in October", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWEST ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. \u2014 It was still two weeks before Halloween when WEZW-FM, the easy-listening standby of Cape May County, pushed the Christmas button.Not to miss out on the merriment, two rival stations in Birmingham, Ala., activated their holiday playlists within minutes of each other last week, and by December nearly 500 stations around the country were expected to go eggnog-and-mistletoe.Even in the age of Pandora and Spotify, the all-holiday format has remained one of radio\u2019s most enduring and profitable gimmicks, with hundreds of stations luring listeners with endless loops of \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d and \u201cGrandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\u201d In the last decade, the number of stations embracing the format has nearly doubled, and competition between broadcasters often leads to stations turning earlier and earlier. \u201cI have never seen a more successful, impactful and sustainable impact on ratings as all Christmas music,\u201d said Dan Vallie, a consultant to WEZW and other stations around the country.As radio has been challenged by online media, one of broadcasters\u2019 defensive strategies has been to emphasize their connections to local audiences through news and the kinds of community events that cannot be replicated online. Christmas programming has proved a perfect fulfillment of this, with broadcasters adding cheerful information between the Burl Ives and Mariah Carey chestnuts.For WEZW, at just 4,000 watts the smallest of eight stations operated by a local broadcaster, Equity Communications, the annual Christmas format change is also a bragging right. The most common time for stations to change \u2014 or \u201cflip,\u201d in industry parlance \u2014 is around Thanksgiving, but WEZW, also known as Easy 93.1, has carved a niche for itself as the first in the country to go all-Christmas, a change eagerly awaited by its mostly older, conservative listenership.\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d said Marla Uzanus, 62, a retired hairdresser in the tiny community of Cape May Court House. \u201cI would rather listen to this than some of this other nonsense you hear on the radio, these young people glorified for cursing and swearing.\u201dOn a recent afternoon at the office of Equity Communications, stuffed reindeer dolls covered the reception desk and a retired corrections officer dressed as Santa Claus for WEZW\u2019s toy drive. Gary Fisher, Equity\u2019s owner, said that the station\u2019s early format flip was partly timed to help sell eight-week advertising packages to local merchants. But he also stressed the role of light, nostalgic music in lifting the spirits of an area that has been buffeted by the ailing economy and Hurricane Sandy.\u201cChristmas music is comfort-zone radio for a lot of people,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. \u201cGiven everything that has happened in Atlantic City and in South Jersey, this music really is a link to better times. That\u2019s why we feel it works for us early.\u201dA seasonal playlist of just under 300 songs helps WEZW nearly double its normal ratings each year, Mr. Fisher said. According to Nielsen, adult contemporary stations that play Christmas music enjoy ratings increases of up to 87 percent during the workday hours but can gain as much as 129 percent in the evening, when listening is typically low. On Christmas Eve, listening can go up as much as 582 percent. In New York, the adult-contemporary powerhouse Lite FM (WLTW, 106.7), which is owned by iHeartMedia, the company formerly known as Clear Channel, usually goes all-Christmas in mid-November; over the years it has fended off competition from various other stations, including the oldies outlet WCBS-FM.Darren Davis, president of the iHeartRadio Network, said that planning for the format usually begins in August, which includes \u201cdressing up\u201d a station\u2019s entire audio ambience. \u201cIt\u2019s about more than just the songs,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cWhen you walk into a Hallmark store around the holidays, everything is Christmas \u2014 the carpet is Christmas, the window decorations are Christmas, it smells like Christmas candles and cookies. That\u2019s the environment we try to create with our Christmas radio station.\u201dMost of the stations that go all-holiday are usually in the easy-listening or adult contemporary format. But some programmers resist the change, saying that the benefits of gaining even many temporary listeners \u2014 the stations usually switch back immediately after Christmas \u2014 are outweighed by the risk of losing loyal listeners who are turned off by the seasonal hoopla.\u201cIt\u2019s like Starbucks saying, \u2018We\u2019re not going to serve anything but peppermint lattes for the next six weeks,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Tony Lorino, the program director at KZPT-FM in Kansas City, Mo. \u201cFor those six weeks, a lot of people are going to come in and get peppermint lattes, but somebody else who\u2019s just looking for their regular coffee is really upset.\u201dPandora, which this year has 35 holiday-themed channels, and Sirius XM, which will have eight such stations this season \u2014 including one, Holly, that streams online year-round \u2014 would seem to pose an existential challenge to all-Christmas radio. And in fact Pandora\u2019s popularity as a holiday outlet rivals that of terrestrial radio. In the 2012 season, for example, 25 million people listened to holiday music on Pandora, the company said. On Dec. 24 that year, 28.4 million people listened to holiday music in the top 48 radio markets, according to Nielsen, a number that climbed slightly to 28.6 last year. (Pandora\u2019s numbers for 2013 were not available.)But that competition appears to have had only minimal impact on the popularity of radio\u2019s Christmas stations. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any decline in growth\u201d of holiday stations, said Paul Heine, a senior editor at Inside Radio.For WEZW, the excitement over Christmas radio starts to build months before the format flips, when listeners take to the station\u2019s Facebook page and begin to ask when the holiday music will start up again. Once the music begins, messages pile up asking the programmers to keep it going even past the holiday.\u201cIt rekindles my faith in the power of local radio,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. \u201cRadio is still such a big deal down here that you can push the Christmas button on a little 4,000-watt station in Cape May County and have everybody go wild about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ebola Alarm, Rebellion in Europe and Turkey\u2019s Puzzling Attack", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryAnyone who has tried to follow the tangled affairs of Europe in ages past, or merely watched \u201cThe Borgias,\u201d knows how quickly alliances can be made and broken to meet the shifting needs and politics of rulers and peoples.Witness the complexity of Washington\u2019s efforts to form a coalition against the Islamic State in the Middle East, or even to agree on who the real enemy is. Or look at how various countries in Europe, in happier days firmly linked with Germany in the European project, have ganged up on Berlin and its obsession with austerity. And in the struggle against Ebola, it is remarkable how a few cases in the United States and Europe abruptly brought home the danger of a scourge that had been ravaging western Africa for over six months.Ebola HysteriaEbola is the most urgent of these examples, because the number of victims is rising exponentially in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and the more infected people there, the greater the risk of the virus\u2019s vaulting to neighboring countries and elsewhere in the world.The reaction in the United States to the death of a man from Liberia and the infection of two nurses who treated him has been at times indecent, with a flood of recriminations, political showboating and panicked overreactions, like the closing of schools where students, parents or staff members had been on a flight with an infected nurse, or demands from members of Congress to ban commercial flights to the United States from Ebola-stricken lands.Health officials say trying to seal the borders to travelers from West Africa could create panic there, complicating efforts to combat the epidemic, and would create a false sense of security since borders in the region are leaky and people would bribe their way out.It is, of course, natural \u2014 and in keeping with the Tip O\u2019Neill rule that all politics is local \u2014 that people will react more strongly to danger when it draws near, and will take whatever measures they can to protect themselves. But medical authorities are convinced that despite some unfortunate glitches when the disease made its first landfall outside Africa, the United States and other advanced countries have ample resources in public health facilities, information and money to quickly trace where the infection may have spread, and to take measures to halt its advance.It is in Africa where Ebola is effectively out of control, and it is there that the world needs to join forces to halt it. The World Health Organization said this past week that transmission was \u201crampant\u201d in Sierra Leone, where the disease had spread to every part of the country. The W.H.O. said that the virus was killing 70 percent of the people it attacked, and that the rate of infection could rise from 1,000 a week to as many as 10,000 a week by early December.Perversely, the arrival of Ebola in the United States and Europe may be the jolt rich countries need to wake up to the clear and present danger of the epidemic, and to join forces in sending the equipment, money and trained medical staff to Africa to fight this war the way it must be fought.European DisunionThe European leaders who gathered in Milan on Thursday were as collegial in public as a gathering of cardinals under the Borgia pope, and as unhappy and conspiratorial in private.Stock markets were tumbling, borrowing costs were increasing, populists were rising up and the International Monetary Fund on Oct. 7 had once again scaled back its forecast for growth in the eurozone, from 1.1 percent down to just 0.8 percent, with a warning that the region might slide back into recession.France, Italy and the European Central Bank have taken the lead in a rebellion against Angela Merkel, the unyielding enforcer of austerity.Germany is the dominant economic force in Europe, but its economy is also losing momentum. German exports and factory orders are down. That has added to the pressure on the German government to do the unthinkable \u2014 to take action to spur economic growth. \u201cWe need to show that Europe is capable of investing in growth, and not only in rigor and austerity,\u201d said Matteo Renzi, Italy\u2019s prime minister, who has joined with France\u2019s new prime minister, Manuel Valls, in challenging the Germans by seeking to breach eurozone limits on national spending to stimulate their economies. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has sided with the rebels, leaning on Germany to go easier on budgetary discipline and to spend more on public works.The conflict, which has been building over several weeks, has spooked markets, and was seen as one of the factors in a stock market rout that began Wednesday. With Germany itself beginning to feel the pinch, Ms. Merkel may soon have to start looking for wiggle room.Sorting Out the EnemiesThe band calling itself the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has done everything possible to make itself everybody\u2019s enemy, decapitating hostages, murdering prisoners, enslaving women and children and conquering large tracts of territory in Syria and Iraq. One of the few forces that has managed to resist it are the Kurds, and a battle for Kobani, a Syrian Kurdish city near the Turkish border, is a critical one.On Monday, Turkey plunged into that battle \u2014 against the Kurds. Turkish warplanes attacked positions of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, known as the P.K.K., in southeastern Turkey. The P.K.K. is linked to the Kurds fighting the Islamic State in Kobani, and the United States had been urging Turkey to come to the assistance of Syrian Kurds.Turkey fought a nasty war for years against the P.K.K. and its dreams of Kurdish autonomy, and as far as the Turks are concerned, the more the Islamic State and the Kurds fight, the better. As Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, recently said, \u201cHey, world, when a terrorist organization like ISIS emerges, you all speak out, but why don\u2019t you speak out against the P.K.K. as a terrorist organization?\u201dMr. Erdogan also wants the United States and its allies to fight not only the Islamic State, but the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria as well, and has demanded that the allies create a no-fly buffer zone in Syria along Turkey\u2019s border with that country.The Turkish position is only one piece of the tangle of alliances and conflicting goals among the enemies of the Islamic State. They include, for example, Iranian-backed Shiite militias that once fought the United States, and Iran itself, which opposes the Islamic State but supports Mr. Assad.In that maze, it may not be entirely strange that while Turkey, America\u2019s ally in NATO, was bombing the P.K.K., the United States was supporting the P.K.K.\u2019s allies in Kobani by bombing Islamic State positions. That\u2019s far beyond what Tip O\u2019Neill had in mind, but the Borgias would understand.Serge Schmemann is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Support for Protesters Is Hard to Find on the Streets of Beijing ", "Date": "2014-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut here on the streets of China\u2019s capital, where the ruling Communist Party\u2019s heavy hand is most keenly felt, it can be hard to find people who openly support the demonstrators and their demands, and not just because censors and Chinese security agents have been muffling the voices of protest supporters.On social media and over shared meals at restaurants, many young professionals express suspicion and even hostility toward the students and the Occupy Central protest movement. They accuse the students of selfishly blocking roads and disrupting the lives of ordinary residents; others, parroting government propaganda, blame Western governments for orchestrating one of the most high-profile challenges to Beijing\u2019s authority in years.\u201cIf necessary, the protesters should be removed by force,\u201d said Gordon Qi, 20, a dual economics and psychology major at one of the capital\u2019s most prestigious universities.Two weeks into the protests, aggressive censorship has left many people in mainland China with only a vague but unfavorable impression of events in Hong Kong. Others, busy with work or wary of discussing politics, say they do not care.But some of the most vociferous critics of the protests are young Chinese, a number of them educated abroad and able to gain access to unfiltered news by using software that circumvents China\u2019s so-called Great Firewall.In nearly two dozen conversations this week, they warned about the protests\u2019 impact on Hong Kong\u2019s economy, the paramount value of maintaining social stability and what some called the hypocrisy of trying to improve society through civil disobedience \u2014 sentiments that have dominated news coverage in mainland China since the protests began late last month.More than a few spoke with resentment about what they said was an air of superiority among those born and raised in Hong Kong, a former British colony. \u201cOnly the salespeople in luxury stores there are nice to us,\u201d Li Wanzhen, 21, a land resource management student who studied at Columbia University, wrote in an email.But perhaps the most notable element of criticism was a lack of sympathy for the protesters\u2019 central goal: greater democracy. In interviews, many people said Hong Kong residents should be content with the liberties they already have, which far exceed those on the mainland, while others warned about the dangers of truly open elections, a refrain that Communist Party propagandists have embraced with greater confidence in recent years as they promote the \u201cChina model\u201d of authoritarian governance at home and abroad.\u201cWe have to be wary of democracy turning into anarchy,\u201d Wen Gao, 23, an entrepreneur, said over tea at a cafe in the capital\u2019s gleaming high-tech Haidian district. \u201cI think it\u2019s a deceptive concept. People will develop a habit of impatiently opposing things without providing any constructive ideas of their own.\u201dAlthough such views are by no means monolithic among mainland China\u2019s educated elite, they are increasingly common. Reared on Hollywood films and European literature, those born since 1980 have been among the greatest beneficiaries of China\u2019s opening up to the West. With their English first names, iPhones and vacations abroad, they are the generation that was supposed to be inexorably drawn to the ideals of democracy and free expression.For nine days, waves of pro-democracy protests engulfed Hong Kong, swelling at times to tens of thousands of people and raising tensions with Beijing.Instead, many mainland Chinese in their 20s and 30s are stridently nationalistic and accepting of a government narrative that presents the Communist Party as the only entity capable of protecting an unwieldy country of 1.3 billion from the social chaos and foreign hostility that looms just beyond the horizon.Zhu Yan, 25, a software company project manager who studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he saw nothing wrong with Beijing\u2019s insistence that party leaders have the final say over the candidates for Hong Kong\u2019s leader, a main grievance of the protesters. \u201cThat\u2019s how the government can look out for everyone\u2019s interests,\u201d he said.For liberal-minded Chinese who support political reform, the roiling debate over the so-called Umbrella Revolution has exposed buried fault lines and tested relationships.Peng Jingchao, 27, a Chinese graduate student in Tokyo, said he had grown weary of arguing with friends, many of them educated overseas, who were actively condemning the protesters on social media. Many of their claims, he said, reflect a knee-jerk defense of the nation.\u201cFor a lot of them it\u2019s hard to shake their patriotic syndrome, in that they view any critique of the government as an attack on the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, a lot of those students who are able to study overseas come from upper-class families and are beneficiaries of the current system.\u201dMany of those interviewed found it difficult to accept the protesters\u2019 stated aspiration for unfettered elections as the reason for the demonstrations. Instead, they blamed outside instigators seeking to stoke tensions over stagnant incomes, rising housing prices and the frustrations many in Hong Kong feel toward the surge of mainlanders who crowd stores and compete for spots in local universities.Others said Hong Kong residents were spoiled and self-centered. Li Fang, a professor in his early 30s who studied at an Ivy League college and spent eight years in the United States, criticized Hong Kong residents as refusing to speak Mandarin, China\u2019s official dialect, and as lacking appreciation for the economic benefits Beijing provides. \u201cIt seems Hong Kong people only consider themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never think of the mainland.\u201dStill, some analysts cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from the protest opponents. They noted that online censors had moved quickly to delete pro-Occupy sentiment, allowing critical comments to dominate the social media discourse. Across China, security personnel have detained at least 40 people who expressed solidarity with the protesters, including a group of artists who attended a poetry reading inspired by the protests in Hong Kong, human rights advocates say.Qiao Mu, director of the Center for International Communications at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said many mainland Chinese were probably silently cheering the protests but afraid to make their voices heard. \u201cIt\u2019s very sensitive to take a stand,\u201d he said.Despite holding positions that mirror those of the government, some critics of the protests were reluctant to speak out. Several who posted online criticism of the demonstrators later backed out of scheduled interviews or requested that their full identities be concealed, saying they were worried about the repercussions of appearing to cooperate with a Western news outlet. Others said it was safer to stay silent.Over lattes at a Starbucks in central Beijing, a woman who just returned from studying in the United States was asked if she saw any parallels between her fear of the authorities and the trepidation of protesters anxious about the Communist Party\u2019s creeping influence in Hong Kong.She shook her head.\u201cYou just don\u2019t understand China,\u201d said the woman, a political science major. \u201cSometimes it just makes sense to keep your mouth shut.\u201dJonathan Ansfield contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Amid Tight Races, Bill Clinton Urges Arkansans to Back Democratic Ticket", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJONESBORO, Ark. \u2014 Former President Bill Clinton, plunging right into his home state\u2019s tight elections, implored Arkansans on Monday to support the Democratic ticket and defy predictions that turnout will plummet without a presidential race on the ballot.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the luxury of staying home, so I am pleading with you: Vote,\u201d Mr. Clinton told college students at an outdoor rally here at Arkansas State University\u2019s campus.It was his first appearance of the fall campaign in the state that propelled him to the White House, and Mr. Clinton was notably spirited as he lashed out at out-of-state conservative groups that have hammered Senator Mark Pryor, the only Democrat remaining in the state\u2019s congressional delegation and perhaps the most endangered Senate incumbent in the country this year.Mr. Clinton \u2014 joined by Mr. Pryor; Gov. Mike Beebe; and former Representative Mike Ross, the Democratic nominee hoping to succeed Mr. Beebe \u2014 addressed selfie-snapping students at two state universities and seemed to relish being back on the Arkansas campaign trail. He spoke in blunt terms at the first rally of the day at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway about how Republicans are trying to make the election about President Obama, who is deeply unpopular here. Republicans, he said, \u201cwant you to make this a protest vote,\u201d alluding to the Senate and governor\u2019s races as well as a competitive House contest in Central Arkansas.\u201cAll three of these races, they\u2019re saying, \u2018Hey, you might like these guys but, hey, you know what you got to do, you got to vote against the president. After all, it\u2019s your last shot,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Clinton said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good scam isn\u2019t it? Give me a six-year job for a two-year protest. That\u2019s Mark Pryor\u2019s opponent\u2019s message.\u201dIf this was a veiled help-is-on-the-way message, it was the only implicit reference to the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Clinton made no mention of his wife and her plans, whatever they may be. The former president has deep personal connections to many of the candidates on the Democratic ticket this year and has regularly offered them advice about their campaigns. But Arkansas has become a far different place politically in the 40 years since Mr. Clinton first ran for office here.Arkansas resisted the Republican tide far longer than most any other Southern state, but has finally given way to the region\u2019s partisan realignment. Republicans now control both chambers of the Legislature, and if Mr. Pryor loses, the party will hold all six seats in the congressional delegation. Officials in both parties said Mr. Obama\u2019s unpopularity explained why this last bulwark of Southern Democratic strength fell. And Mr. Clinton made no effort to deny that theory on Monday.\u201cThey\u2019re really running against the president, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he said in Conway. Speaking as much as a strategist as a surrogate, he continued: \u201cYeah, the economy is coming back. But nobody believes it yet because you don\u2019t feel it.\u201dReturning to the preferred Democratic message this year, he echoed the president\u2019s speech last week in Illinois, noting that the country had created more jobs under the Obama administration than Europe and Japan combined.Without mentioning their names, Mr. Clinton criticized some of the Republicans running here on such issues as education aid and agriculture. But he also went further than Mr. Pryor had in talking about the new health law, heaping praise on Mr. Beebe for embracing the Affordable Care Act and noting how many Arkansans received health coverage in part because the state expanded Medicaid.Mr. Pryor\u2019s opponent, Representative Tom Cotton, has avoided criticizing Mr. Clinton and used the former president\u2019s return to the state to release a list of \u201cDemocrats for Cotton.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not bothered by President Clinton\u2019s support of Senator Pryor,\u201d said David Ray, a spokesman for Mr. Cotton. \u201cWhat bothers us, and should bother all Arkansans, is Senator Pryor\u2019s lock-step support of President Obama\u2019s agenda, which he has supported 93 percent of the time, including on Obamacare, the failed stimulus bill, the Wall Street bailout, judicial nominees, you name it.\u201dMr. Clinton\u2019s visit to the two campuses was the first leg of a two-day tour. He and the Democrats will make two more stops Tuesday in Northwest Arkansas, including at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. Democrats here are dedicated to pushing voter turnout beyond what is typical in nonpresidential years and want to use the former president\u2019s visit to engage college students. At both stops Monday, campaign staff members with clipboards signed up students after the rallies.\u201cWe\u2019ve registered almost 100,000 new voters,\u201d Mr. Ross said.Democrats have also been helped by outside spending, but Mr. Clinton made no mention of that as he mocked third-party Republican groups for trying to portray Mr. Pryor as a liberal. (\u201cHe\u2019s up there with Mao Zedong and all the left-wing crazies,\u201d Mr. Clinton joked in Jonesboro.)The \u201csuper PACs,\u201d Mr. Clinton told the students, have no investment in their lives.\u201cI get really steamed when I see all these out-of-state television ads from people that don\u2019t give a rip about Arkansas, don\u2019t know the difference between Jonesboro and Paragould, couldn\u2019t find Hope if their life depended on it.\u201dEven though he now lives in Chappaqua, N.Y., and Washington, Mr. Clinton repeatedly stated his affinity for Arkansas and gently mocked reporters who wondered why he is so fixated on politics here. \u201cI plead guilty. I\u2019m obsessed with you,\u201d he told the Arkansas State students. \u201cI love you and I want the best.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jolting Some, Afghan Leader Brings Wife Into the Picture ", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 For more than a decade, the Afghan first lady, Zeenat Karzai, was virtually invisible. Sequestered deep inside the high-walled presidential palace, she appeared to have abandoned her career in medicine and was only rarely allowed out in public by President Hamid Karzai.\u201cPeople don\u2019t hear from me very much,\u201d Mrs. Karzai acknowledged in a rare interview in 2004.Mrs. Ghani, who sat in the second row amid a sea of men, wearing dark glasses, nodded back. A murmur ran through the crowd.It was a brief but symbolically loaded moment. Many Afghan men are reluctant to talk about their wives with other men in private, let alone before a crowd. Not only did Mr. Ghani introduce the first lady publicly, he announced that she would have a public role in advocating for women, children and the internally displaced.Among the mostly urban Afghans who have supported the widening freedoms for women of the past decade, it was an occasion to be celebrated.\u201cNot only did he say her name, he said it with pride,\u201d said Hasina Safi of the Afghan Women\u2019s Network. \u201cThis is really a big deal in this country.\u201d Shafic Gawhari, the chief executive of a major media company, said on Twitter that it was \u201cone of the best parts of his speech.\u201dJust as predictably, though, religious conservatives fulminated against Mrs. Ghani, a Christian who met her husband at university in Beirut, Lebanon, in the 1970s and moved with him to the United States. \u201cNobody has seen her convert to Islam,\u201d Maulavi Habibullah Hasham, of the Bagh Bala mosque in Kabul, said in an interview. \u201cI believe her mission is to convert people to Christianity.\u201dThe cleric\u2019s comments echoed slurs employed by Mr. Ghani\u2019s rivals during the election and pointed to a reactionary streak in Afghan society that goes back many decades.In the 1920s, King Amanullah, a modernizing monarch, brought his Western-attired wife, Queen Soraya, into the public eye \u2014 only to be forced into exile in 1927 by mullahs who used her reputation to attack the king and diminish his authority.Mr. Karzai used that precedent to excuse his wife\u2019s low profile \u2014 even if it ignored the radical transformation of Afghan society since that time. \u201cGet real,\u201d said Nasrine Gross, a women\u2019s rights activist who took on Mr. Karzai on the subject in 2009. \u201cThat was three generations ago, and not even 1 percent of society was literate.\u201dMrs. Ghani\u2019s initial public foray was a brief and deferential speech commemorating International Women\u2019s Day in March. Speaking in halting Dari, she noted the importance of women\u2019s traditional roles as homemakers and mothers, while suggesting they could \u201cuse these skills outside the home as well.\u201dYet it provided fodder for Mr. Ghani\u2019s opponents. Atta Mohammad Noor, a powerful regional governor, led the public attacks, while scurrilous claims circulated on social media: a doctored photograph showing Mr. Ghani worshiping in a Christian church, and accusations that his wife was an Israeli agent.Mrs. Ghani is highly educated, having studied in Paris, Beirut and New York, where she graduated from Columbia University. Visitors to the couple\u2019s house in the Darulaman area of Kabul are shown into an elegant reception hall, with a mixture of Middle Eastern and Nuristani architectural elements, that Mr. Ghani is proud of pointing out was designed by his wife.Friends say that she has a softer, more composed demeanor than her husband, who is known for his impatience and hot temper. During the election campaign she made a handful of public appearances at his side and, as a bitter electoral dispute dragged on through the summer, offered important support.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Rula\u2019s wisdom, I don\u2019t think Dr. Ghani would have had so much success,\u201d said Seema Ghani, a family friend who is not related. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a personality at home to tone you down, to help with your emotions.\u201dAlthough some take his advocacy of his wife as a repudiation of Mr. Karzai, Mr. Ghani is a feminist by conviction, Seema Ghani said. \u201cHis grandmother, who was an authoritarian, had a great influence on him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was the first person to say, \u2018Respect a woman as a woman \u2014 not as a mother, sister or wife.\u2019 Coming from an Afghan man, that\u2019s quite unique.\u201dMrs. Ghani, for her part, has skirted the question of her religion; in one recent interview, she suggested that it did not matter.But social and cultural issues matter, too. Previously accused of appearing professorial and aloof, Mr. Ghani has come to embrace the importance of Afghan imagery, those close to him say. In meetings, he fingers a set of amber prayer beads; before the election, he grew a beard.In that context, the public role of Rula Ghani can be taken as one element of a complicated political balancing act \u2014 a topic that has been picked up by another member of the Ghani family. The Ghanis\u2019 daughter, Mariam Ghani, a Brooklyn-based artist, exhibited a video in April that showed an ethereal female figure wandering through the ruins of the old royal palace where King Amanullah once ruled. The piece was called \u201cA Brief History of Collapses.\u201dMohammad Ghannam contributed reporting from Beirut.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Says Impact of Asset-Buying Plan Will Be \u2018Significant,\u2019 but Does Not Detail Size", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank said on Thursday that a plan to begin buying private sector assets this month would have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the eurozone economy. But European stocks slumped after the bank left open questions about how big the program would be.Mario Draghi, the central bank president, said it could draw on a pool of 1 trillion euros, or about $1.26 trillion, of securities tied to bank loans, known as asset-backed securities and covered bonds.Analysts expect the central bank to buy perhaps a fifth of that amount, and they have expressed doubt about whether the sum will be enough to revive bank lending and prevent the eurozone from slipping back into recession.Stocks in Europe fell, in investors\u2019 apparent frustration that the E.C.B. bond-buying program would not be more ambitious. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks eurozone blue-chip shares, dropped 2.77 percent, while the euro rose against the dollar.\u201cInvestors are somewhat disappointed,\u201d Emmanuel Petit, director of fixed income at Rothschild & Cie in Paris, said in an email message.Meeting in Naples, Italy, the central bank\u2019s Governing Council decided to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.05 percent. The decision was a foregone conclusion because the rate was already effectively as low as it could go. Instead, analysts and investors were focused on the asset purchase program.In a news conference after the meeting, Mr. Draghi declined to say how big the purchases would be. The size will depend on how the economy reacts to bond buying and the effectiveness of other central bank stimulus measures, he said.While there is a potential asset pool of \u20ac1 trillion, he said, the central bank will not buy that much. In addition, it will not accept securities that it deems overly complex, he added.The central bank said it would buy assets from throughout the eurozone, including Cyprus and Greece, despite their deeply troubled economies. But the quality standards imposed on assets by central bank may limit the amount it can buy.The E.C.B. said it expected its purchases to stimulate the market and prompt banks to package more of their loans into asset-backed securities or covered bonds, increasing the supply.The Governing Council\u2019s visit to Naples, one of its twice-yearly meetings outside Frankfurt, drew protests from people who blame the central bank for Italy\u2019s economic woes.Mr. Draghi said it was wrong to fault the bank for problems in Europe. He was alluding to banners, mostly denouncing austerity measures, that were hoisted by protesters outside the meeting at the 18th-century Capodimonte Museum on a hill in the northern section of Naples.One read: \u201cJob insecurity, poverty, unemployment, speculation. Free us from the E.C.B.!\u201d Another depicted Mr. Draghi as Caesar, with laurel leaves around his ears, and read \u201cBlock the E.C.B.\u201d\u201cGo back and ask yourself, where were you two years ago?\u201d Mr. Draghi said, with a hint of annoyance in his voice. Listing measures that the central bank took to avert disaster, he said, \u201cWe fought a systemic crisis.\u201d\u201cI find the description of the E.C.B. as the guilty actor needs to be corrected,\u201d he said.Many economists fear that the eurozone economy is in danger of officially tipping into deflation, a condition in which falling prices prompt consumers to delay purchases, undercutting sales by businesses and leading to increased unemployment.Because of limits on the supply of private sector assets that meet central bank quality standards, many analysts expect the bank to eventually resort to purchases of government bonds, emulating the so-called quantitative easing used by the Federal Reserve in the United States.Such action would inevitably provoke an outcry in Germany, and most analysts do not expect the central bank to begin buying government bonds until next year, if ever. In Germany, there is widespread fear that the central bank\u2019s buying of bonds would amount to a transfer of wealth from better-off countries to poorer ones. Many Germans believe they will have to pick up the bill if some countries default on bonds owned by the central bank.There were immediate complaints from Germany on Thursday that E.C.B. purchases of private sector assets would allow banks to unload their bad loans.\u201cThe E.C.B. will presumably buy junk paper and thus increase the burden on taxpayers should defaults occur,\u201d Hans-Werner Sinn, a prominent economist who is president of the Ifo Institute research group in Munich, said in a statement.Recent economic data have added to fears that the eurozone is at risk of deflation. The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone is at a five-year low, having dropped to 0.3 percent in September, official data indicated this week. That is far from the central bank\u2019s target of slightly less than 2 percent, which was last reached nearly two years ago.In addition, unemployment in the eurozone remained at 11.5 percent in August.The central bank may take some comfort in the decline of the value of the euro, which despite edging up on Thursday, is near a two-year low against the dollar. A weak euro makes imported goods more expensive for residents of the eurozone and contributes to higher inflation.Slumping energy prices were one reason for the decline in inflation in September, from 0.4 percent in August. But there was also a drop in the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes prices for food and energy because they tend to fluctuate more.The decline in that rate is potentially more worrying for the central bank because it is a more direct reflection of slack demand and the poor health of the eurozone economy.Recent surveys show that business managers have become more pessimistic, further increasing concern that the eurozone economy is suffering from the crisis in Ukraine and related sanctions against Russia.Last month, the European Central Bank offered four-year loans to commercial banks in the eurozone that were nearly interest-free, in an effort to make more credit available to businesses and households.But demand from banks for the loans was less than expected, and many economists say they believe the central bank will need to overcome its reluctance to buy government bonds to restore growth.Mr. Draghi on Thursday left the door open to that option, saying the central bank was \u201cunanimous in the commitment to use other unconventional instruments if we were to judge that the risks for inflation were to deteriorate.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Naples.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Environment Is Grabbing Big Role in Ads for Campaigns", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd in Kentucky, a spot for the Republican incumbent Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, depicts him flanked by coal miners as a woman intones, \u201cThe person fighting for our coal jobs is Mitch McConnell.\u201dAds mentioning energy, climate change and the environment \u2014 over 125,000 spots and climbing on the Senate side \u2014 have surged to record levels during the 2014 midterm election cycle, reflecting the priorities of some of the nation\u2019s wealthiest donors, with Democrats now pouring millions into campaigns to match Republicans, according to an analysis by Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks political advertising.In Senate races in the general election, the analysis found, energy and the environment are the third-most mentioned issue in political advertisements, behind health care and jobs.The explosion of energy and environmental ads also suggests the prominent role that the issues could play in the 2016 presidential race, especially as megadonors \u2014 such as Thomas F. Steyer, a California billionaire and environmental activist on the left, and Charles G. and David H. Koch, billionaire brothers on the right \u2014 take sides. Leaders of major environmental groups like the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters said they had collectively spent record amounts of money in this election cycle.\u201cCandidates are using energy and environment as a sledgehammer to win a race,\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, the senior vice president for politics at Kantar Media/CMAG.Groups representing the energy industry and environmental advocacy have typically been the lead players in presenting policy positions in ads, but this year the candidates themselves and party political committees are also taking on that role.In conservative states, Republicans are attacking Democrats for supporting President Obama\u2019s environmental regulations. And in coal-mining states, each side is running ads showing its candidates embracing both the fuel and the workers.In more liberal states, Democrats are attacking Republicans for denying the science of climate change and taking money from the Koch brothers.\u201cWhat\u2019s important about what\u2019s going on right now is the extent to which the Democrats feel confident playing offense on environmental and energy issues, and the extent to which polling shows that they are scoring when they do that,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.So far this year, nearly 47,000 spots have mentioned coal, while roughly 26,000 have mentioned the E.P.A. (The mentions have been almost entirely negative, except for spots in support of Senate Democrats, who have cited the agency in a positive manner more than 5,000 times.)In the hotly contested Kentucky race between Mr. McConnell and Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic challenger, both campaigns and outside donors have highlighted coal in ads.In Colorado, Brad Todd, a Republican ad maker at OnMessage Inc. who is working on Mr. Gardner\u2019s campaign, said the president\u2019s policies have provided Republicans with material to attack Democrats. \u201cPresident Obama has taken the Democrats too far left on energy,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think that\u2019s really a metaphor for all the things they distrust about the president.\u201dIn Republican-leaning states with economies that depend on fossil fuels, Democrats are promoting their support of those industries as a way to distance themselves from the president. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, ran an ad trumpeting the ways in which her position as the chair of the Senate Energy Committee could help Louisiana oil companies.In Democratic-leaning and swing states, the 2014 election cycle has seen a massive infusion of spending by liberal environmental groups that want to protect Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy on climate change, while elevating the issue of climate change ahead of the 2016 campaign.Chief among them is NextGen Climate, an advocacy group founded by Mr. Steyer, who has pledged that his group will spend a minimum of $100 million this year to elect candidates who back policies that would forestall climate change. The group has focused its spending on presidential battleground states like Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.\u201cWe picked states that will be relevant in 2016. These are all states that are key presidential swing states,\u201d said Christopher Lehane, the group\u2019s chief strategist.The NextGen strategy is to spend heavily on advertising that attacks Republican candidates who question or deny the science of climate change.Using polling and demographic data, the group has targeted a million of what it calls \u201cclimate voters\u201d in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan and New Hampshire. The plan, said Mr. Lehane, will be to run even more ads aimed at those voters ahead of the 2016 elections.Last week, the group released an ad depicting Republican candidates who dispute the science of climate change as cavemen. \u201cThe idea is that denying climate change is a path to political extinction,\u201d Mr. Lehane said.In Senate races in several key states, Democratic candidates, political committees and liberal advocacy groups also have run ads criticizing Republicans for their positions on climate change by tying them to other issues. In Colorado, the League of Conservation Voters ran an ad linking two key issues in the race \u2014 energy policy and women\u2019s rights \u2014 and attacking Mr. Gardner, the Republican candidate, for opposing both environmental regulations and some forms of contraception.\u201cThey\u2019re making it part of the narrative that their opponents are outside the mainstream,\u201d said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters. \u201cTo the extent that it\u2019s being used aggressively, that\u2019s definitely new.\u201dDuring the 2012 presidential campaign, the issue of climate change did not come up once in the three debates between Mr. Obama and his Republican rival, Mitt Romney. This year, the Senate debates in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana and West Virginia have all included robust exchanges on the candidates\u2019 views on coal, climate change, energy and the E.P.A.\u201cI think the political intensity is only going to increase around this issue,\u201d said Bill Ritter, the former Democratic governor of Colorado, who now runs an energy policy center at Colorado State University. \u201cIf you polled Republican governors around the country, you\u2019d find that there\u2019s an increasing number who are actually talking about it and trying to deal with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Large banks and hedge funds expressed their distrust of the president with a sell-off, pushing down Brazil\u2019s main stock index by 3.7 percent and clipping the currency by 2.7 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re emerging from an election that has revealed a rift between economic classes,\u201d said Murillo de Arag\u00e3o, the president of Arko Advice, a political consulting firm in Bras\u00edlia. \u201cThe level of tension is remarkably high, accentuating a loss of confidence in the president among big economic interests.\u201dIn the final vote tally, Ms. Rousseff took 51.64 percent, against 48.36 percent for her rival, A\u00e9cio Neves, a scion of a political family from the state of Minas Gerais. It was the smallest margin of victory in any presidential election since democracy was re-established in the 1980s after two decades of military rule.While some in Brazil\u2019s middle and upper classes might wish otherwise, few changes are expected in the popular antipoverty programs that have shielded poorer Brazilians from an economic slowdown, with the unemployment rate remaining low even as the economy went into recession this year.But Ms. Rousseff has signaled other changes, including the appointment of a new finance minister. That could open the way for a shift away from policies that have created ire in Brazil\u2019s business establishment, like price controls on fuel in a bid to keep inflation from accelerating.In addition to the class tension, the election also exposed geographic fissures, reflected by the strong showing of the centrist challenger Mr. Neves in S\u00e3o Paulo and states in southern Brazil, compared with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s sweep of states in the north and northeast, where recipients of social welfare programs broadly backed the incumbent.\u201cPower was always in S\u00e3o Paulo in the south, but when the\u201d governing party \u201cstarted sending resources north to help us, many in the south simply didn\u2019t accept it,\u201d said Saron Zacarias, 51, a refrigeration technician from Fortaleza, in the northeast. \u201cNow this division is clear again, like there are two parts to Brazil.\u201dBut Ms. Rousseff \u201cwill now have to look beyond the class struggle rhetoric of her campaign and show whether she can regain the trust of the south and southeast,\u201d Tony Volpon, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said in a research note.Some voters are warily following her vow to fight corruption in her own government. \u201cThey don\u2019t punish; they are just corrupt,\u201d said Maurice Vianna, 42, the manager of a shoe-repair shop in Bras\u00edlia, referring to the Workers Party. \u201cFor me it is a criminal organization.\u201dLucy Jordan contributed reporting from Bras\u00edlia, and Mariana Sim\u00f5es from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pragmatism on Climate Change Trumps Politics at Local Level Across U.S.", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI BEACH \u2014 As she planned her run for the Florida House of Representatives this year, Kristin Jacobs told her team that she wanted her campaign to address the effects of climate change. Her advisers were initially skeptical, noting that voters typically said they cared about the environment, but considered the issue less urgent than the economy and health care.Ms. Jacobs, a commissioner for Broward County, pressed her case, arguing that few issues were more critical to residents of southeast Florida than street flooding at high tide \u2014 sometimes even on sunny days \u2014 and ocean water seeping into their drinking water. \u201cIt\u2019s how you ask the question,\u201d she said. \u201cIs clean water important to you?\u201dThe results were \u201cshocking,\u201d said Steven J. Vancore, a pollster and political consultant advising Ms. Jacobs.But in the Florida Keys, George Neugent, a Republican county commissioner, said that while people might disagree about what to do about climate change, the effects of flooding and hurricanes were less ambiguous. \u201cClearly rising tides are going to affect us,\u201d he said.That is leading to discussions about a broad range of possible responses, including elevating roads and switching the Bermuda grass at the local golf course to paspalum, which tolerates salty water.\u201cI have to be very careful when I say some things, especially to the skeptics,\u201d Mr. Neugent said, adding that he avoided arguments about the science of climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the effort or the time to prove what clearly is a factual situation. We\u2019re living with it.\u201dJames Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, Ind., has sought to be active on climate change issues. The city has reduced its energy use with fuel-efficient city cars and small trucks, LED lighting and so-called green buildings. It also pipes the methane gas from the treatment of wastewater into boilers that help produce so-called biosolids that can be used as fertilizer.\u201cI don\u2019t think we want to be the party that believes in dirty air and dirty water,\u201d Mr. Brainard said, noting that the Environmental Protection Agency was founded under President Richard M. Nixon, a Republican. Despite the broad agreement among scientists on climate change, he added, \u201cthe problem in D.C. is that a lot of people are making a lot of money keeping people mad at each other.\u201dBob Inglis, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina who is working to get members of his party to accept climate change and identify solutions, said his argument was not a hard sell for local officials \u201cwho are in the business of fixing things, not just talking about them.\u201d His hope, he added, is that the viewpoint \u201ceventually percolates up to the people making grand pronouncements.\u201dCommissioner Paula Brooks of Franklin County, Ohio, which includes Columbus, the state capital, said there had been a 37 percent increase in flooding in the area since 1958, as heavy rains have overwhelmed aging drainage systems.\u201cI really see this as a very bipartisan issue that people are interested in talking about,\u201d said Ms. Brooks, a Democrat who also serves on Mr. Obama\u2019s climate task force. \u201cThese weather impacts are coming home to roost.\u201dPatsy Parker, the mayor of Perdido Beach, Ala., said ruinous flooding in April washed away roads and left a gully 12 feet deep. As much as 30 inches of rain fell. That the town is by the Gulf of Mexico makes it especially vulnerable to hurricanes.Ms. Parker is also a member of the president\u2019s climate change task force, but she said that being on the panel had not bolstered her popularity in the predominantly Republican region of southern Alabama.She claims no party affiliation, and says that she does not talk about climate change with her constituents, nor about whether the weather crises might get worse. Discussing climate change in a community like hers, she said, just stirs people up.\u201cI leave that conversation up to the experts,\u201d she added, \u201cthe scientists who have much more knowledge and training than I do.\u201dMs. Parker does welcome interest in protecting Perdido Beach from the ravages of severe weather. \u201cEven if it gets no worse, it\u2019s bad enough that we need to do what we can,\u201d she said.John P.

{"Headline": "Any Flavor You Want as Long as It\u2019s Vanilla", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel 2015 Hyundai SonataAfter several so-so attempts, Hyundai broke into the big leagues of family sedans with its 2011 Sonata.How did the Korean company do it? By going bold, with a swoopy design that seemed inspired more by \u201cfour door coupes\u201d like the Mercedes CLS than by the precedents of typical family cars. Sure, the sixth-generation Sonata drove better than the previous versions. But the Sonata\u2019s expressive, ballyhooed styling helped to separate it from the midsize herd.The 2011 Sonata actually went on sale in 2010, and promptly posted the biggest year-over-year sales gains of any car in America. Sales nearly doubled from 2009 to 2011, topping 225,000 in 2011 and 2012. Those figures remained well behind the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, but within striking distance of the Ford Fusion and Nissan Altima.But while Fusion and Altima sales have since swelled to 300,000 and more, the Sonata\u2019s tally dropped more than 10 percent last year, to barely 200,000 cars.It was apparently time for another change. But instead of going bold, this time Hyundai has veered toward the boring. Instead of aiming high, at design and performance leaders like the Accord, Fusion and Mazda 6, the new Sonata seems to point its harpoon at an easy target, the Toyota Camry, in the great white belly of the midsize class.The new Sonata adopts Hyundai\u2019s evolving design language, which it calls Fluidic Sculpture 2.0, an approach that paid off handsomely on the new Genesis luxury sedan. But not so much this time.To my eye, this new design is a step backwards, so bland that the Sonata might be the world\u2019s first gluten-free sedan.The new Hyundai even manages to make the nondescript Volkswagen Passat look distinctive by comparison. At least the VW is recognizably German, whereas the Sonata appears to have been styled by a United Nations subcommittee.Where the Hyundai isn\u2019t anonymous, it\u2019s awkward. On the Sport version that I tested, dated-looking chrome strips ran above the rocker panels, just below the doors, with more shiny trim framing the side windows.Inside, the previous model\u2019s flamboyant shapes and waterfall-style center stack \u2014 the central section of the instrument panel that flows into the console \u2014 weren\u2019t for everyone, but the cabin was bursting with personality. The new interior is better in some respects \u2014 it\u2019s quieter, with more comfortable seats and the latest features. But the conservative theme that works fine on the bigger Genesis is less felicitous on an affordable family car.Sober enough for a Shaker dining room, the conventional sweep of the Sonata\u2019s dashboard leaves little for the eye to savor. The plainness only highlights the standard-issue feeling of the materials and switches.Ergonomically, there\u2019s nothing inside to really complain about, but there\u2019s nothing to get excited about either, unless you thrill to the touch of an available 8-inch digital navigation screen.I will say this: Hyundai has become a leader in useful, intuitive gizmos, and its navigation, multimedia and BlueLink app systems are as simple and easy to use as you\u2019ll find.I\u2019d be more willing to overlook the design, or ascribe it to my subjective tastes, if the Hyundai\u2019s driving experience left any lasting impression. But again, the Sonata is as unwilling to make waves as a midlevel manager hiding in a cubicle.12 PhotosThe Sonata, at least, is one big cubicle, with a class-leading passenger capacity of 106.1 feet and an impressive 16.3-cubic-foot trunk, which ties the Chevy Malibu for class honors. The back seat is equally enormous; the E.P.A. actually classifies the Sonata as a large car.Extensive use of high-strength steel, along with a reworked suspension, makes the Sonata more rigid and reduces upsetting impacts over big bumps, the biggest flaw of the departing model.That 2011 Sonata set a family car trend in another area, eschewing a 6-cylinder option and offering only 4-cylinder engines. That philosophy continues, but there\u2019s not enough payoff: Hyundai has dialed back the horsepower of its top-selling versions, resulting in modest gains in smoothness and only meager improvements in fuel economy.On my Sonata Sport test car, which started at $23,175, the standard 2.4-liter 4 made 185 horsepower (down from 190 last year) and 178 pound-feet of torque (from 179 before).To keep pace with burly V6 rivals, the previous Sonata offered a lusty but raucous 2-liter turbo 4 with 274 horses and 269 pound-feet. That engine has now adopted a smaller turbocharger that improves low-end torque while slashing peak output to 245 horsepower and 260 pound-feet.Both engines add electronic variable valve timing on the intake side of the engine for faster response, better mileage and reduced emissions. And even though their power has been dialed back, the turbocharged Sonatas have gained just 2 m.p.g. in the city mileage rating, to 23 m.p.g. The highway rating of 32 m.p.g. is unchanged.For the most popular version, the 2.4-liter Sonata Sport, mileage ratings are unchanged at 24/35 m.p.g., though the basic SE model does rise to 25/37 mpg.There\u2019s still a Sonata Hybrid, but it will continue to be built with the old body style until the middle of next year, when an all-new Hybrid is due to be released.Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to drive the Sonata Eco, a more mechanically interesting version with a 1.6-liter turbo making an estimated 177 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. Whereas other Sonatas get a somewhat leisurely 6-speed automatic transmission, the Eco, which starts at $24,085, adopts Hyundai\u2019s 7-speed dual-clutch automated transmission. The company estimates the Eco\u2019s mileage at 28 m.p.g in town and 38 on the highway.Both the 2- and 2.4-liter engines seem a bit smoother than before, though it\u2019s hard to tell how much of that is because of improved sound insulation. Neither power plant is a world-beater in terms of accelerative force.For the 2.0T, the 245 horsepower feels more like 220, and leaves the Hyundai looking vulnerable to rivals, including the Accord and Camry, that offer 6-cylinder smoothness and thrust.Like the Genesis, the Sonata adopts an electric steering system mounted on the steering rack itself, rather than on the steering column. But the Sonata still felt strictly midpack in terms of steering and handling. In city driving, especially, the Sonata felt weighty and ponderous, the kind of car that struggles to stay out of its own way.The Sonatas were at their best on highways, where their chassis and suspension improvements produced more stable, controlled handling.The Sonata rolls out of Hyundai\u2019s factory in Montgomery, Ala., starting at $21,960 for the SE version. My 2.4-liter Sport started at $23,985 and came with few options. The Sport 2.0T test car started at $30,385 and totaled $34,460 as equipped.With the previous Sonata, Hyundai earned a solid foothold in the family sedan class. That accomplished, the company now seems inclined to put its feet up and relax. For buyers who care to join them, the Sonata is as traditional a sofa as you\u2019ll find.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jaguar Tries Another Wagon", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When Jaguar introduced the XF sedan in 2008, there were two major omissions in its European lineup. There was no 4-cylinder turbo-diesel engine option and no station wagon, or estate as they call them here.A 2.2-liter turbo-diesel made its belated debut in 2011, and now, rather late in the current XF\u2019s life-cycle, a wagon version has arrived: the Sportbrake.Over the years, Jaguar has usually been more oriented toward sexy coupes and roadsters, like the marque\u2019s more celebrated models including the XKE and the XJ-S V12, not wagons. When the company offered a wagon in 2004, it was based on the widely unloved, Ford-designed X-Type sedan. Its sales numbers were accordingly disappointing. Just before the X-Type line received its death sentence in 2009, the company sold the wagon version in the United States, badged as the Sportwagon. Quality was an issue, and the market proved it wasn\u2019t ready to consider a Jag in an unsexy utilitarian get-up.But it seems definitions are changing for many sports car makers, which find the need to branch out into other segments in order to produce the volumes needed to survive in the ferociously competitive international market. Porsche makes the Cayenne sport utility vehicle and the Panamera hatchback, Aston Martin offers the four-door Rapide, and Ferrari has the FF shooting brake. These models are selling well, so why shouldn\u2019t Jaguar offer something similar?But while Europeans are mad for wagons, Americans, still, are not so keen on them.I recently spent a week driving around southern England in the Sportbrake and found it to be a surprise. For the most part, the wagon version of the XF was enjoyable.The car is gorgeous; seductively well-proportioned. The interior is handsome, too. It has a comfortable driving position. The ride was good, although the steering was not as precise in the standard driving mode as it was when I switched to Dynamic. Also, in Dynamic mode, the body exhibited less side-to-side motion and firmer, flatter cornering. At normal settings the Sportbrake felt softer, with more understeer when I drove it hard, than the sedan version.Generally, though, the Sportbrake just wafts along the road, a word I\u2019ve previously used only after driving the Rolls-Royce Ghost.The 4-cylinder version rides on passive suspension dampers; the higher-end models get active dampers and air springs in the rear.The Sportbrake carries nearly 250 pounds more weight than the 3,900-pound European-market sedan, so the extra thrust of the most powerful engine, an option package that costs nearly $10,000, was an expensive but welcome addition to the test car. It was effortlessly fast.During my test drive I averaged fuel economy around 30 miles a gallon. Although they are not available in the United States, Stuart Schorr, a spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover, said in an email that diesel engines might make their way into American-market Jags by 2016.Here\u2019s an odd statistic: The Sportbrake and the sedan each offer the same 19 cubic feet of luggage space. What happened to all the extra space in the Sportbrake? Actually, if you stow the package shelf and lower the rear seatbacks, the capacity expands to 59 cubic feet (you can drop the seatbacks in the sedan too, but that expands its capacity to only 34 cubic feet). Still, that does not make for a very roomy wagon. (Salesman\u2019s cue: \u201cMay we instead show you something in our Range Rover line?\u201d)The wagon\u2019s virtues, however, include easier cargo access, the possibility of loading larger objects like small pieces of furniture or a disassembled kennel, and greater headroom in the second row of seats (no third row is offered) as a result of the Sportbrake\u2019s higher roofline.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keeping Ebola at Bay ", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Ebola cases in the United States show that American hospitals and public health officials have much to learn about effective ways to protect health care workers and the public from possible infection. One of the nurses, who was monitoring her own temperature, called the C.D.C. and was allowed to take a commercial flight from Cleveland to Dallas-Fort Worth even though she had a slight fever, which did not violate current guidelines. That was an incredible lapse in judgment by the C.D.C. Health officials and the flight\u2019s airline are now scrambling to notify passengers, crew members and janitors who cleaned the planes she traveled on of possible exposure. While the danger to those people appears slight, this incident shows that the C.D.C. needs to lower the fever threshold in its guidance and advise against any travel on public forms of transportation for 21 days by people who have potentially been exposed to the virus. There is more the agency ought to do. It should be increasing the rigor of its guidelines on protective clothing for health care workers, hospital readiness, and training on the handling of Ebola cases. President Obama said on Thursday evening that he is considering appointing an \u201cEbola czar\u201d to manage the government\u2019s response. While the chance that an infected patient will show up at any particular hospital or clinic is very small, health workers should still know the basics of what to do if a patient arrives at their door. National Nurses United, the country\u2019s largest union of nurses, says there has been almost no hands-on training, just easy-to-ignore guidance documents.The advice now from the C.D.C. is for emergency room staff to take travel histories, isolate patients who have fevers and have been in West Africa, and call the C.D.C. if Ebola is suspected. Once a case is diagnosed as Ebola, the C.D.C. will fly in a swat team of experts within hours to oversee treatment. At a congressional hearing on Thursday, House members asked whether the United States was adequately protected against people who might have been infected in West Africa but did not yet have symptoms. The current system relies on screening before they are allowed to fly out of West Africa and again when they reach airports in this country. So far, only one infected patient \u2014 the man who was treated in Dallas and later died \u2014 escaped detection at the airports since the epidemic was first identified seven months ago. There should be some comfort in knowing that that part of the system is working.Even so, some members of Congress, mostly Republicans, have called for barring entry to all people who have been in the Ebola-stricken countries as a way to keep the virus out. The danger is that if other nations followed an American ban with bans of their own, economies in West Africa would be crippled. That could only reduce the ability of those nations to fight the epidemic, and make it even more likely the disease would spread through porous borders to other African nations and beyond.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cameron Acts Like the Front-Runner He Would Like to Be", "Date": "2014-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From BritainLONDON \u2014 At his party conference last week in Birmingham, Prime Minister David Cameron pulled out all the stops.Mr. Cameron made a queasily emotional appeal about his support for the National Health Service by making a reference to his dead son. Then he mocked the Labour Party\u2019s leader, Ed Miliband, to his left, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, Nigel Farage, to his right, and even his own coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.But as a real indication of the desperation of his Conservative Party, seven months before Britain\u2019s next election, Mr. Cameron promised 30 million voters more than $11 billion in tax cuts without a hint about how he would pay for them.Just as airily, Mr. Cameron promised to reduce Britain\u2019s large budget deficit a further $40 billion without touching the health service. And he pledged to have a balanced budget in 2018, a vow that seems highly unlikely, given that Britain\u2019s deficit is still running at 5.5 percent of gross domestic product and now sits at more than $151 billion. For those on the right, Mr. Cameron vowed to negotiate new restrictions on the ability of immigrants from other European countries to come to Britain and work. \u201cWhen it comes to free movement,\u201d he said, \u201cI will get what Britain needs.\u201dBut what a large number of Britons want is what Mr. Cameron cannot get for them \u2014 an end to the European Union\u2019s principle of free movement of people and labor, one of the main reasons a sizable minority of Conservatives, and the U.K. Independence Party, want to leave the European Union altogether.The Conservatives also pledged to overrule decisions of the European Court of Human Rights if they overturned British laws, another pledge of questionable legality.But Mr. Cameron delivered a polished, prime-ministerial address; a sharp contrast to Mr. Miliband\u2019s wandering speech to his own party convention the previous week in Manchester. Speaking with few notes and strolling the stage, Mr. Miliband somehow omitted \u2014 or repressed \u2014 any mention of the budget deficit or immigration.Mr. Miliband said he simply forgot those sections of his speech, causing much glee among the Tories. Mr. Cameron reminded Britons that he himself had once forgot his young daughter, Nancy, down at the pub after a Sunday lunch. \u201cBut if you want to be prime minister of this country,\u201d he said, \u201cyou cannot forget the biggest challenge we face.\u201dMr. Cameron still has a large lead over Mr. Miliband in perceptions of economic competence, so he perhaps could risk throwing economic reality to the winds to appeal to disappointed voters tempted to go left or right.After the party conferences, Mr. Cameron got a boost in the polls. But his task is a tough one.Historically, Professor Travers said, governing parties lose about 1.2 percent of the vote a year. And even if Mr. Cameron wins 36 percent of the vote, as he did last time, it will not be enough to return him to Downing Street with a parliamentary majority, and perhaps not even as the largest party.Though Labour appears to be floundering now, it remains the favorite to form the next government in a divided Britain, where the two main parties, which together received about 98 percent of the vote 50 years ago, now get barely two-thirds. As such, there is a very real likelihood of a hung Parliament and a weak coalition government after the election on May 7.The strangest part of the party conference season, the last before the election, was how optimistic the Conservatives were, and how flat and unenthusiastic Labour was, even though this is an election that party should normally win.But Labour, too, has significant problems, with the 44-year-old Mr. Miliband not judged to have the gravitas of a prime minister, and close to 60 percent of voters dissatisfied with his performance. While voters believe Labour will enhance the National Health Service, the party is still regarded as untrustworthy on the economy.But Mr. Farage and UKIP are a real and present danger for Mr. Cameron, because they appeal to those who would normally vote Conservative but regard his government as insufficiently anti-European. UKIP should win its first seat in Parliament this week, with a Tory convert, Douglas Carswell, expected to retain the seat he won for the Conservatives in Clacton-on-Sea.The Independence Party, which won 3 percent of the vote in 2010, is running around 13 percent in various polls, and Mr. Farage is viewed as favorably as Mr. Cameron. While UKIP will not win many seats, most voters leaning toward the party are Tory voters in marginal districts, whose defections could throw seats to Labour or the Liberal Democrats, which will remain the third-largest party and could again end up as the power broker in a hung Parliament.As Mr. Cameron warned graphically in Birmingham, in one of his better lines, \u201cOn the 7th of May, you could go to bed with Nigel Farage and wake up with Ed Miliband.\u201dAs for Labour, it is getting a boost from the collapse of the Liberal Democrats, who are being punished by voters for going into government as junior partners with the Tories. Having won 23 percent of the vote in 2010, the Liberal Democrats have fallen below 9 percent in most polls.Labour also has a built-in advantage from the way constituency boundaries are drawn. It can win a majority with around 34 or 35 percent of the vote, Professor Dunleavy said, while the Conservatives need about 40 percent.But it is hard to overestimate the anti-European tone of the campaign. Even Mr. Cameron, when asked, said he cared \u201c1,000 times more strongly\u201d about Britain than Europe and would \u201cnot be heartbroken\u201d if Britain exited the European Union.While most Britons believe that Mr. Cameron wants to stay in the union, one of his main pleas to voters who are considering voting for UKIP is that he is the only candidate with a chance of power who has promised to deliver a referendum on membership in the bloc.Mr. Miliband has refused to back that pledge, saying that Britain belongs in Europe, not outside of it.After the agonies of the Scottish referendum, Mr. Cameron\u2019s pledge is just one more reason some believe that Britain is heading into unstable and uncertain political waters, and that a Labour government is more likely to provide stability than a Conservative one \u2014 though it is not yet clear what kind of government Britain may get.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Slumping Prices, No End in Sight for U.S. Oil Production Boom ", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven after a drop of as much as 25 percent in oil prices since early summer, several government and private reports say that it would take a drop of $10 to $20 a barrel more \u2014 to as low as $60 a barrel \u2014 to slow production even modestly.On the downside, taxes and royalties on oil will decline, potentially cutting into the finances of oil-producing states like Texas, Alaska, Oklahoma and North Dakota. And it will continue to put pressure on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut output to support prices, as well as cause economic pain to big producers like Russia, Venezuela and Iran.Current production levels can be sustained in the shale fields in 2015 even if the Brent global oil benchmark, which fell to just under $84 a barrel at one point this week, dropped to as low as $60 to $65, according to Rystad Energy, an international oil and gas consultancy based in Norway.\u201cOil output will respond very slowly to a drop in oil prices,\u201d Bjornar Tonhaugen, vice president for oil and gas markets at Rystad Energy, wrote in a report released this week. \u201cMarkets may even be oversupplied next year more than previously thought.\u201dSlowing American oil production is like slowing a freight train moving at high speed. The current production of 8.7 million barrels a day, the highest in nearly a quarter-century, is more than a million barrels a day higher than it was only a year ago. Most companies make their investment decisions well in advance and need months to slow exploration because of contracts with service companies. And if they do decide to cut back some drilling, they will pick the least prospective fields first as they continue developing the richest prospects.The Energy Department this week reported that only 4 percent of shale production in North Dakota, Texas and other states needed an oil price above $80 a barrel for producers to break even on investments. One reason is that improved efficiencies in hydraulic fracturing and other modern production techniques have increased the output of each new well month after month in recent years.For example, the Energy Department expects that new oil production from new wells in the North Dakota Bakken shale field will increase by seven barrels a day next month over this month, and in the Texas Eagle Ford field by eight barrels a day. Put together, over a couple of months that translates into tens of thousands of new barrels every day across the country, with no increase in investment.Sadad Al Husseini, the former head of exploration and production at Saudi Aramco, predicted that the United States would add a million more barrels of oil in daily production over the next year.\u201cWhat is softening prices is weaker demand because of the global economy and the growing volume of North American production,\u201d Mr. Al Husseini said in an interview. \u201cSo will prices bottom? It depends on what comes from the U.S.\u201dHe added that when investors start seeing $75 to $80 oil, that will cut back some ambitions, and that could mean \u201ca leveling off of new supplies by midyear 2015.\u201dAll told, the I.E.A. said only about 2.6 million barrels out of total world production of just over 90 million barrels requires a break-even price of $80, including some fields in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Russia, which are high-cost fields in part because of how much the governments require producers to pay them in taxes and royalties.Global and American benchmark oil prices bounced back a bit on Friday, ranging between roughly $83 and $86. The American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, fell below $80 for the first time in two years briefly Thursday morning, and some oil experts say it could break the symbolic threshold again in coming days.Lower oil prices mean lower prices at the pump for American consumers. The average national price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Friday was $3.14, 10 cents lower than it was a week ago and 22 cents lower than a year ago, according to the AAA motor club. That is the lowest price in more than three years.Roughly a third of the nation\u2019s gas stations are selling gasoline for less than $3 a gallon. The average American family saves about $120 a year for every dime drop in the gasoline price, experts say.Many oil experts say that Saudi Arabia and several other OPEC countries that have shaved their prices in recent days are trying to drive down global production, and particularly American and Canadian production, to protect their market share. But with a growing population and struggling to tamp down potential domestic unrest, Saudi Arabia carries a rising social service budget that is financed almost entirely by oil money.Over the long term, it may need to stretch its production as much as or more than the United States.\u201cFor the government to balance budgets on an ongoing basis, higher oil prices are inevitably required,\u201d Badr H. Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, a United Arab Emirates-based oil and gas company, said in an email exchange. \u201cOtherwise, if oil prices continue to fall, maximizing production may be an imperative to securing required higher revenues, and that in turn might have a catastrophic effect with the creation of a major glut.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Las Vegas Schools Groan From Growing Pains", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Schools in this suddenly robust community are so packed these days that 13 of them stay open 12 months a year. Children go to classes and eat lunch in cramped, windowless trailers, bustling with restless students. Thousands more take online classes at home, and school district administrators, desperate for space, are looking to abandoned strip malls for classrooms.But the growth, if a welcome sign of economic vitality, is overwhelming the district. Teachers are scrambling to educate students without the classrooms they need and with no prospect of new ones being built any time soon.Parents, many of whom were drawn here by the promise of good schools, said they were increasingly concerned at the daily churn: of floating school calendars and staggered classes, of fears that their children might be sent to a less crowded school across town, of the challenge of scheduling a family vacation when children are on different calendars.\u201cHe comes home worried he may have to move schools because his classroom is full to bursting,\u201d Nancy Muner said of her 7-year-old son, Tommy.All around Forbuss Elementary, new homes are rising on land that was once scarred by foreclosed properties, a reminder that school overcrowding is likely to get worse, not better.School district administrators describe the situation as dire. \u201cI could build 23 elementary schools today, and they would open up full and overcrowded,\u201d Pat Skorkowsky, the superintendent of schools, told the Henderson Chamber of Commerce at a recent breakfast.A few moments later, over coffee at the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino, he recalled the pangs of anxiety he felt when the breakfast opened with a developer boasting of his latest housing project. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t want to be a leading economic indicator,\u201d Mr. Skorkowsky said.The concern ricocheted among parents as they dropped off their children at Linda Rankin Givens Elementary School on a recent morning. Hule Johnson, 42, an accountant and father of two boys, said he had seen a precipitous decline in the quality of education over his years here; his son Jamie, 8, now comes home with questions about his homework. \u201cHow can they be involved with all these kids they have to handle every day now?\u201d he asked.To complicate matters, the enrollment surge comes during a national teacher shortage. The Clark County School District has 650 vacancies on its roster of 18,000 teaching positions. First-grade classes, which are supposed to have 16 students, often have 25, while some middle school classes have as many as 32. Elementary schools are 17.6 percent over capacity, according to district statistics.Tia Hartman, 29, said her daughter, Aria, 8, feels \u201clost in the crowd with all these kids.\u201dStill, for a community that has been battered by bad economic news \u2014 the collapse of the construction industry, record foreclosures, high unemployment \u2014 it is hard not to see this growth as a bit of good news.Stephen Brown, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said the surge was a strong indicator that the recovery had taken hold. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing a fairly strong population growth in the last couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe increase in enrollment in Clark County schools suggests that 2014 might now show an even stronger population growth.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how they are going to fix it,\u201d said Diane Boyle, a mother of two. \u201cPutting your finger in the crack and hoping the whole dam won\u2019t explode isn\u2019t going to work. The economy is marginally improving, and it\u2019s just going to get worse.\u201dAs for her children, Dyan, 12, and Quinn, 10, Ms. Boyle said, \u201cEvery day they ask if they are going to go to the same school next year.\u201dEven if a bond construction measure is put on the ballot in 2016, as school officials are hoping, the earliest a new school might open would be around 2020.\u201cIt is severe, and there\u2019s no relief in sight through traditional means,\u201d said Erin E. Cranor, president of the Board of School Trustees.The result of the delays was on display recently at Forbuss. As the day ended, the school\u2019s driveway became a tangle of idling S.U.V.s, Jeeps and school buses and of parents walking their children to an endless line of cars parked on the street. Inside, many students ate lunch and even used bathrooms inside trailers. Nearly 100 students from four classes crammed into an aerobics session, bouncing to the thump-thump-thump-thump of dance music in a scene of happy chaos that defied real supervision.Across the packed district, 30,000 students take at least one class a day online, often at home. This year, 13 schools \u2014 up from three for the 2013-14 school year \u2014 will stay open the entire year, forcing an end to the era of summer vacations for those children.Some of what the district is doing has stirred concern, including the broadening of online classes.\u201cI\u2019m old school,\u201d said Mary Ann Kramar, a first-grade teacher at Forbuss. \u201cI just believe you have to have that teacher there and monitoring making sure the child does what they are supposed to be doing at the level that they are supposed to be doing and not just being on the computer. I just don\u2019t know how you monitor that.\u201dThe pale-yellow trailers carry a stigma, as they resemble those used in California to accommodate prisoners. They have given rise to a language of euphemism: Trailers are called \u201cportables,\u201d while online schooling is referred to as \u201cblended education.\u201dThere are 2,230 trailers in use; each costs $50,000. Keeping each school open year-round costs $308,000, including salaries and utilities.\u201cI need to meet their needs, and it\u2019s very hard to meet the needs of all the children at the same time,\u201d Ms. Kramar said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that families are moving back in. At the same time, there\u2019s not a lot of room in our classrooms, not enough books, materials. We do our best.\u201dKimberley McGee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

India joined the bank, along with Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, news agencies reported.The bank, proposed a year ago by President Xi Jinping of China, is to offer financing for infrastructure projects in underdeveloped countries across Asia. China, which has promised to contribute much of the initial $50 billion in capital, sees it as a way to increase its influence in the region after years of fruitless lobbying for more say in other multinational lending organizations.Mr. Xi, meeting with representatives of the founding members after the signing ceremony, said the new bank \u201cwill help to improve global financial governance,\u201d according to Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency.Australia has yet to make a decision on joining, Gemma Daley, a spokeswoman for Joe Hockey, the treasurer of Australia, said on Friday. The South Korean finance minister, Choi Kyung-hwan, said this week that Seoul was willing to participate under certain conditions, including a commitment from the bank to meet international standards on issues like the environmental impact of projects. \u201cIf such issues are resolved, there will be no reason for us not to join,\u201d Mr. Choi said on Wednesday.Still, the countries\u2019 absence on Friday was a blow to the project.Chinese officials have said that the bank is intended to complement existing lending organizations, not to compete with them.

{"Headline": "A Capital of the Arts Is Forced to Evolve", "Date": "2014-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From ParisPARIS \u2014 Even as the economy and his own fortunes sputter, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has whirled through a flurry of recent museum openings and art events in Paris with the zeal of someone in the middle of a political campaign, reveling in the nation\u2019s place as a capital of culture.\u201cWe cannot build anything based on nostalgia,\u201d but instead \u201con emotion, hope and conquest,\u201d Mr. Hollande said at the inauguration of the Mus\u00e9e Picasso, boasting that France was \u201cculturally shining.\u201dThe opening of two major museums within days underscored the place that France, and Paris in particular, holds as a beacon of art and culture. But even at Paris\u2019s moment of celebration, France\u2019s underlying political and economic troubles were a tear in an otherwise lovely canvas that was impossible to ignore.France\u2019s leadership is struggling to pay for the government it provides. While the capital remains a global magnet of culture, it increasingly risks becoming a playground for the world\u2019s elite, detached from its midsize cities, villages and countryside, where rising hardships stoke resentments and widen the opening for far-right parties.The tough economic climate is forcing France to revisit its vaunted model by which the state funds and manages the arts, and the juxtaposition of the two museums made clear the lurking shift being forced on France\u2019s values, with all the attendant controversies.The Louis Vuitton Foundation is just the latest example of how French cultural glory is being privatized. And the epic troubles of the Mus\u00e9e Picasso \u2014 closed five years amid cost overruns and a staff revolt \u2014 illustrate how even a state with a proud history of arts patronage retooled its approach in the face of an erosion of resources.\u201cAll the shine and gloss of this cultural moment hides the misery befalling our culture budgets, our decline in the global art market, our creaking state institutions, our falling behind the Chinese, the declining appetite of the French public for museums,\u201d said Isabel Pasquier, a cultural journalist for France Inter radio. \u201cParis still has all of the glamour, but not the financial strength.\u201dSome view the shifting winds as a healthy sign. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel, a writer who hosts a radio show on the arts and wrote a book on the funding of culture in the United States, noted that the conventional view in some quarters used to be that culture financed and organized by the state was good and culture shaped by market forces, whether Hollywood or Disneyland, was bad.\u201cThere is a new way of thinking that having a billionaire create a nonprofit foundation for the arts is a very good thing and a public good,\u201d Mr. Martel said. The notion that business can pollute the arts is changing, he added.Reduced national spending over the past two years has forced major landmarks like the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay to turn to the public in search of crowdfunding to restore a precious Gustave Courbet painting or to acquire a historic jeweled table. The Mus\u00e9e Picasso itself financed much of its remodeling costs by renting precious works to foreign museums.Because of necessity and budget cuts, institutions like the Palais de Tokyo are experimenting with renting out some of their space to luxury goods companies like Chanel, which created an exhibition about its classic perfume, Chanel No. 5, last year.\u201cThe nation\u2019s budget helps a lot of the arts, but the situation is very difficult,\u201d said Jean de Loisy, president of the Palais de Tokyo, whose museum has been responsible for raising 50 percent of its budget in the past two years. \u201cWe are like museums in all the world everywhere, and we have to ask people and brands to participate and I think that\u2019s very good.\u201dWhile the French capital\u2019s museums are a huge international draw \u2014 more than 70 percent of the Louvre\u2019s nine million visitors last year were foreign \u2014 the city\u2019s place in the global art market is less secure.Against that backdrop, the rise of audacious buildings funded by big business is becoming more attractive.Fleur Pellerin, the culture minister, said in an interview that France had a long tradition of private sector funding of the arts, and she stressed that state funding and private funding of culture were \u201ccomplementary.\u201dIn the case of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, the new building is funded by subsidiaries around the world of LVMH, the luxury goods conglomerate, according to Jean-Paul Claverie, an adviser on the project to Mr. Arnault, who said the foundation preferred not to discuss its financing.\u201cIn philanthropy, we never express figures because we want to let the dream and the emotion speak for itself,\u201d Mr. Claverie said while sitting near the reflective pools of the new museum. \u201cBernard Arnault had in mind that the group has to contribute to the arts because the success of the group is based on its relationship with the artistic image of France.\u201dBut critics are already wary of the impact of a private museum with huge resources. At Foire Internationale d\u2019Art Contemporain, or FIAC, the contemporary arts fair in Paris that ended Sunday, the debate centered on issues such as whether a private museum was really more concerned with brand marketing.\u201cThe capital of culture is only marketing for Louis Vuitton, and that\u2019s where they are going,\u201d said Fernando Morales-de la Cruz, creator of the Itinerant Museum of Art, who was roaming FIAC in search of funders for his decidedly different approach: painting the artworks of legendary artists on nude adults walking in public spaces.\u201cWhy do you have to make these museums so amazing outside?\u201d he added. \u201cBecause this is a marketing tool.\u201dIn a sign of the tensions over the increasing privatization of the arts, the creation of the new Louis Vuitton building was pilloried by some critics as the glorified vanity project of a billionaire who had used his power and influence to build a pyramid and to silence dissent.The widespread publicity about the building \u201cis emblematic of the corrupt relations between the media and LVMH,\u201d fumed Mediapart, an influential online news website, under the headline, \u201cThe Courtesan\u2019s Ball.\u201dNevertheless, others say hard economic times may have the paradoxical virtue of helping to spur creativity and to magnify the importance of culture.Ms. Pasquier, the France Inter journalist, noted that the greatest artists throughout the centuries produced many of their masterpieces when, like France, they were living through difficult periods.\u201cAn artist with no worries becomes spoiled and complacent,\u201d she said, \u201cand the same applies to a country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Recapturing an Opera House\u2019s Former Luster", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Front Row CenterThe Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona\u2019s storied opera house, has survived two fires and a civil war. Whether it can outlive funding cuts and tension between the Spanish government and separatist-minded Catalonia is the question of the moment. Adverse economic forces regularly batter opera houses and threaten their existence. The situation has been especially severe in Spain, one of the European countries hit hardest by the economic downturn. Huge reductions in governmental subsidies have left the Liceu and other opera houses reeling. This month, the Liceu successfully opened its season with a new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d and last summer it attracted a seasoned and respected administrator, Christina Scheppelmann, formerly of the Washington National Opera, as its artistic director. As the Spanish economy begins to recover, the Liceu is likewise striving to regain its former luster. The task is daunting. Subsidies from all sources are down from 28 million euros, or $35 million, six years ago to \u20ac18 million today, according to Roger Guasch, the theater\u2019s general director. Contributions from sponsors have fallen significantly as well, causing the theater\u2019s budget to shrink to \u20ac39 million from \u20ac58 million. In turn, performances were reduced, from more than 100 performances of 13 operas six years ago to 72 performances of nine operas during the 2013-14 season. To save costs the company suspended operations for a month in 2011 and 2013.Another dimension to the Liceu\u2019s situation is political tension between Catalonia, the Spanish region of which Barcelona is the capital, and the national government in Madrid. As a cultural icon of Catalonia, the theater is inevitably drawn into the region\u2019s pro-independence movement. At issue is Catalonia\u2019s mandated participation in Spain\u2019s system of redistributing tax revenues from richer to poorer regions. As Spain\u2019s most prosperous region, Catalonia, with 16 percent of the country\u2019s population, accounts for 19 percent of Spain\u2019s output. Cuts in subsidies from the Spanish Ministry of Culture were deep for all concerned, with some opera houses faring worse than the Liceu, such as the spectacular Santiago Calatrava-designed opera house in Valencia; its music director, Zubin Mehta, resigned in protest last summer. But the Liceu\u2019s annual subsidy from the Ministry of Culture is currently \u20ac6.5 million, whereas the Teatro Real in Madrid, which has a slightly larger budget than the Liceu\u2019s, receives \u20ac9 million. The disparity is said to be justified because the Liceu also receives subsidies from Catalonia and local governmental authorities, but in the eyes of Catalonians that only exacerbates the imbalance between national taxes paid and revenue returned. This month, the region\u2019s counselor for culture, Ferran Mascarell, speaking in the Catalan Parliament, lambasted Madrid for failing to pay the Liceu what it was owed and called its culture policies \u201cideologically archaic\u201d and \u201cprofoundly negligent and inefficient.\u201d By also stating that Madrid maintains \u201ca liquidating attitude\u201d toward Catalan culture, Mr. Mascarell gave voice to allegations in Catalonia that Madrid is out to do actual harm.Mr. Guasch, who became director of the Liceu in 2013, declines to point a finger at Madrid, saying simply that the theater will work with the subsidies available to it. As he points out, the number of performances is increasing, with 80 performances of 12 operas expected for the current season. He also succeeded in avoiding subsequent closings of the theater by enacting cost-cutting measures, including importing a production of \u201cPorgy and Bess.\u201dHe emphasized the need for Spanish opera houses to become less dependent on subsidies and more reliant on sponsorship. Last year, a private-public foundation was set up to facilitate corporate donations to the Liceu, but Spain has no law granting significant tax benefits to donors to cultural institutions. Ms. Scheppelmann, who takes over in January, sees her task as maximizing artistic quality within the confines of financial realities. Born in Germany, she has spent most of her career in the United States, first at the San Francisco Opera starting in 1994 and since 2001 at the Washington National Opera, where she was artistic director. Following Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s departure as director in 2011, she essentially ran the Washington company until her departure in December 2012. Ms. Scheppelmann\u2019s call to Barcelona cuts short a stint as chief executive of the three-year-old Royal Opera House Muscat in Oman, which was established by royal decree to promote cultural exchange. She presented a large range of offerings, including world and folk music, jazz, performances by southeast Asian ensembles and modern dance. \u201cThe people were incredibly kind, and the experience of working in another culture intrigued me greatly,\u201d she said. \u201cMy one regret is that I couldn\u2019t stay there another year.\u201dHer familiarity with the way things are done in the United States is likely to be welcome at the Liceu. \u201cIt is important for theaters to become more efficient at what they do without lowering quality,\u201d she said. True to her European roots, she favors government support for culture, yet she also believes that the absence of subsidies in the United States encourages a sense of responsibility for how money is spent. \u201cThe situation there is similar to a young person who doesn\u2019t receive a big allowance from his parents.\u201d She also favors having an active and multifaceted board of directors. \u201cI want a certain kind of board member who contributes to a broad range of artistic views,\u201d she said. Her arrival at the Liceu represents a homecoming of sorts, for she worked there as a young administrator from 1992 to 1994. \u201cMy grandmother was Spanish, and my father was born in Spain and raised in Barcelona,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked at the theater at the time of the fire,\u201d she said, referring to the blaze that destroyed the Liceu in 1994 and interrupted the theater\u2019s attempt to end its isolation from the rest of Europe. As she notes, that goal was finally achieved under her predecessor, Joan Matabosch, who was at the Liceu from 1996 to 2013 and is currently the artistic director of the Teatro Real. Reached in Madrid, Mr. Matabosch said his major achievement at the Liceu was \u201copening up the repertoire to operas never before done in Spain \u2014 from the Baroque to the present \u2014 and presenting them in modern productions by different types of directors.\u201d Mr. Matabosch\u2019s departure to the Teatro Real surprised many Catalans. But the Teatro Real sought a strong artistic director to succeed Gerard Mortier, who cut back his activities for health reasons and died in March. Mr. Matabosch was attracted by the challenge of the new job but is said not to have gotten on well with the Liceu\u2019s former general director, Joan Francesc Marco. The Liceu\u2019s current season was prepared by Mr. Matabosch, who is largely responsible for the next two as well. Ms. Scheppelmann said it was too soon to comment on her plans for the theater, but she did express admiration for the many new operas to emerge from the United States in the past 30 years, mentioning such composers as John Adams, Philip Glass, William Bolcom, Carlisle Floyd and Mark Adamo, and noting that such operas have had greater success in entering the repertoire than have new European operas.  She also said she wanted to set up a young artists program for singers and a program similar to the American Opera Initiative she established in Washington to give training and support to young composers and librettists. The Liceu, which opened in 1847 with Donizetti\u2019s \u201cAnna Bolena,\u201d is the only opera house in Spain with a long and continuous history. The Teatro Real dates from around the same time \u2014 1850 \u2014 but was closed in 1925 and reopened at the instigation of the government as an opera house only in 1997; during the interim it was used as a concert hall.As Ms. Scheppelmann points out, once the Liceu was rebuilt after its first fire in 1861, it was never renovated and consequently had antiquated stage equipment at the time of the devastating 1994 fire. That fire brought with it \u201cthe glimmer of a silver lining,\u201d as Ms. Scheppelmann put it, since the rebuilt theater emerged with modern equipment. The fire also brought home the Liceu\u2019s central importance to the region\u2019s cultural life and its social fabric. \u201cThe next day,\u201d Mr. Guasch noted, \u201cfour governmental entities sat down and decided to rebuild the theater. It reopened in just five years.\u201d \u201cIt has always been a haven for great voices, including those from the region,\u201d such as Montserrat Caball\u00e9, Giacomo Aragall and Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles, Ms. Scheppelmann said. \u201cBut after the fire there was a general outcry \u2014 I was there. The reaction of the population from the city and the region was absolutely amazing.\u201d Advertisement"}

Putin did his best to paint a rosy picture of the Russian economy in a speech to business leaders on Thursday, saying the country remains \u201copen to the world\u201d and has a plan for growth in spite of American and European sanctions.Russia is well prepared to hold out against hard times, he said, because of its still-sizable foreign currency reserves of about $460 billion. To attract investment, he said jokingly as he began a question-and-answer session, \u201call I have to do is smile and show the devil is not as frightening as he seems.\u201dRussia will rely on its reserves to substitute for foreign lending, Mr. Putin said, while stimulating domestic agriculture to put food on the country\u2019s tables in place of Western grocery imports the Kremlin itself banned in tit-for-tat sanctions.Money from one of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth funds, the Direct Investment Fund, can be channeled into investment for businesses cut off from Western financing by the sanctions, he added.He said Russia remained committed to an \u201copen\u201d economy, denied rumors about capital controls and accused the United States and Europe of violating the spirit of the World Trade Organization in imposing sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. Mr. Putin called the sanctions, which single out wealthy individuals and politically connected banks and businesses, \u201cutter foolishness.\u201d\u201cYes, we see strong fluctuations on the currency market,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cBut I will underscore the most important thing: The fundamental factors supporting stability are very strong, very reliable.

Kudrin, said last month that $110 billion has left Russia in capital flight since the crisis in Ukraine erupted.The ruble, wobbly in the best of times, dropped to its lowest level against the dollar since the hyperinflation of the early 1990s, before rallying a bit this week. And Russia\u2019s stock market is down about 3 percent this year, in contrast to about 9 percent growth in stock markets globally, according to an index of world equities compiled by Morgan Stanley.Even senior Russian economic officials, in presentations just preceding Mr. Putin\u2019s, sounded notes that were jarringly different from their leader\u2019s.The minister of the economy, Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, described a Russia mired in stagflation, with an inflation rate of 8 percent and growth of less than 1 percent. The chief economist of VTB, a state-owned bank, has estimated that the Western sanctions trimmed about 1 percent of growth from the gross domestic product, or about $20 billion.Elvira S. Nabiullina, the head of the central bank, rued that after just completing an investor-friendly overhaul of the system for clearing stock market trades, there were currently few foreign investors to make use of it. \u201cFor all this to work like a financial center,\u201d Russia also needs investors, Ms. Nabiullina said.Most striking, German O. Gref, a former minister of the economy and the head of Russia\u2019s largest retail bank, Sberbank, delivered a scathing critique of the government\u2019s economic policies, wondering why the country was turning again to a state-led model of economic development.The Soviet Union broke apart, he said, because of the \u201cmind-boggling incompetence of the Soviet leadership. They did not respect the laws of economic development.\u201d Half the Russian economy is already in monopolized industries, Mr. Gref said. \u201cYou cannot motivate people through the gulag, like in the Soviet Union.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Approves Plan for New Nuclear Power Station in Britain", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The European authorities on Wednesday approved construction of Britain\u2019s first nuclear power station since the mid-1990s, in a ruling that could clear the way for other European countries to plan nuclear plants as part of their energy future.The decision, by the European Union\u2019s competition regulator, removes one of the final obstacles for the plant, at Hinkley Point in southwest England, which would produce about 7 percent of Britain\u2019s current power supply but would not start operating before 2023.Although the British government had already approved the power station, Brussels needed to sign off to make sure the financing plan did not constitute unfair state aid.The plant would be built by EDF Energy, the British subsidiary of the French state-controlled utility, which already operates nearly all the nuclear power plants in Britain. EDF said the plants would cost 16 billion pounds, or $25.7 billion, at 2012 prices.EDF has spent more than 1 billion pounds on design work and preparation for the site, which overlooks the Severn Estuary. Under the arrangement, government-guaranteed rates for the power eventually generated from the plant is guaranteed to give EDF a return on its investment.Policy makers and energy executives elsewhere are closely watching Hinkley Point as a test case of whether new nuclear plants can be built in the West given the high costs and the environmental risks.While valued by proponents as a cleaner-energy alternative to carbon-fueled power plants, the radioactive risks of nuclear power were vividly illustrated by the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011, an event that helped prompt Germany\u2019s decision to abandon all future plans for nuclear power stations.The Hinkley Point project is running years behind schedule, with mounting costs. Centrica, a British utility, walked away last year from its 20 percent share in the project, citing frustration over delays and costs.To share in the costs, EDF has said it wants to bring in two Chinese state-backed companies, the China General Nuclear Corporation and the China National Nuclear Corporation, and, potentially, other investors.The British government is nonetheless pressing on with the project, as it worries about future sources of energy. Britain\u2019s current nuclear plants, which generate around 20 percent of the country\u2019s electricity, are approaching the ends of their lives. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s North Sea oil and natural gas reserves are dwindling, and coal-fired plants are being retired to reduce carbon emissions.Britain\u2019s determination to go ahead with a new nuclear power station at a large cost accentuates the divisions that are opening among European countries over nuclear power. The government wants to build not only Hinkley Point but also several more plants to replace its aging collection of nuclear reactors.Meanwhile, Germany is easing out of the nuclear power business, forcing utilities to rely more on highly polluting coal to generate the kind of steady flows of electricity that cannot yet be supplied by renewable energy sources like solar and wind.Despite the problems, other nuclear providers from around the world are eyeing Britain as a potential market. Toshiba and Hitachi of Japan have been studying British projects, while EDF is also contemplating building another plant on Britain\u2019s east coast at Sizewell. But how many new plants will be built in Britain or other European countries now considering such a move \u2014 including Hungary, Lithuania and Poland \u2014 remains a big question.A few countries voted against the decision. That includes Austria, which opposes the use of nuclear power and is threatening to go to court to try to block Hinkley Point.Of the main European economies, only France has long remained committed to nuclear power.\"You will have a lot of discussion about how expensive these projects are,\u201d said Roland Vetter, an analyst at CF Partners, an energy trading firm in London. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many more companies will want to build more nuclear plants in Britain.\u201dThe specter of future power outages and the pressures to meet climate change goals have pushed the British government to intervene once again in a power sector that was privatized decades ago. The government, which also built all of Britain\u2019s nuclear plants in the past, is now getting actively involved in the energy business, offering generous subsidies not only for nuclear power but also for renewable energy installations like giant offshore wind farms and even projects using tidal power.Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the European official in charge of competition policy, who announced Wednesday\u2019s decision, had been investigating since last year whether Hinkley Point violated European Union rules against state aid.Those subsidies would take two main forms. The government had proposed a guaranteed wholesale price of 92.50 pounds a megawatt hour for the electricity the new plant will generate. That is about double current electricity rates in Britain. In a second form of subsidy, the British government also agreed to provide financial guarantees for the projects estimated at 17 billion pounds in financing.Brussels\u2019 state-aid concern would focus on whether Britain was giving unfair advantages to EDF over other industry players \u2014 or whether the government subsidies would distort energy markets.But Mr. Alumunia said his office had been persuaded by Britain\u2019s argument that the Hinkley project could not proceed without the government\u2019s subsidies and so had agreed not to oppose it after London agreed to some modest changes.Analysts say that there was tremendous pressure on the European regulators to approve the deal because two big players in the 28 nation group, Britain and France, were behind it and because the British government portrayed the power station as necessary to keep the lights on \u2014 not to mention creating around 25,000 jobs during the decade-long construction phase.\u201cThis is an important next step on the road to Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station in a generation,\u201d Ed Davey, Britain\u2019s energy and climate change minister, said in a statement on Wednesday.Although Mr. Almunia said that the Hinkley Point approval did not necessarily create a precedent, analysts say the go-ahead given to the project should encourage other operators interested in building new nuclear facilities in Britain as well as in other European countries to think that they, too, might be able to use government financial support.\u201cAny other countries in the E.U. that want nuclear power will take heart from this decision,\u201d said Antony Froggatt, a nuclear analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research organization.Mark Johnston, a senior adviser to the European Policy Center, a research organization in Brussels, said the opposition to the Hinkley Point decision by a number of countries, which appeared to include Austria, Denmark, Slovenia and Luxembourg, showed that skepticism about the project had different strands.\u201cAustria is against nuclear power, full stop,\u201d said Mr. Johnston. \u201cBut some of the others don\u2019t like the idea that market disciplines are broken to fund nuclear construction, while others may worry that fewer emissions in Britain will just make coal cheaper for other parts of Europe like Poland, and do little to reduce greenhouse gases overall.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Do We Re-elect Them?", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you buy a new car, you dodge the sketchy salesman, read up on consumer ratings, get a feel for the ride. When you get married, you think about growing old with a person, love beyond lust, do a life gut check. And when you elect a federal lawmaker next month, you go against everything you believe in to reward the worst Congress ever.How else to explain the confit of conventional wisdom showing that voters are poised to give Republicans control of the Senate, and increase their hold on the House, even though a majority of Americans oppose nearly everything the G.O.P. stands for? The message is: We hate you for your inaction, your partisanship, your nut-job conspiracy theories; now do more of the same. Democracy \u2014 nobody ever said it made sense. Of course, November\u2019s election will be a protest vote against the man who isn\u2019t on the ballot, a way to make a lame duck president even lamer in his final two years. But before buyer\u2019s remorse sets in, voters should consider exactly what Republicans believe, and what they\u2019ve promised to do. It ranges from howl-at-the-moon crazy talk and half-truths to policies that will keep wages down and kill job growth. Let\u2019s start with the Republican Ryan Zinke, a square-jawed former member of the Navy SEALs who is likely to be the next congressman from Montana. Earlier this year, he said, \u201cWe need to focus on the real enemy\u201d \u2014 that is, the anti-Christ. And who should that be? Why, Hillary Clinton. O.K., he\u2019s just one talk-radio spawn from the Big Sky state. Lock the man up in a room with Ayn Rand novels and the tomes of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises and he\u2019ll be right in the head.It\u2019s harmless hyperbole, you say. The 114th Congress will not take up the matter of what to do with the Beast at the end times. But they will hold crucial votes on whether one of the world\u2019s largest users of energy \u2014 us \u2014 can curb carbon emissions enough to mitigate climate change. Here Mr. Zinke is practically a lefty in his party. He says climate change is not a hoax, which puts him at odds with 58 percent of Republicans who believe that it is. On Obama\u2019s watch, the stock market went on a record run and 10 million new jobs have been created \u2014 more new jobs than in Europe and Japan combined. The president gets no credit for this, because people don\u2019t feel it. Wages are flat. Economic anxiety rides the October air. The Republicans have no jobs plan, as Speaker John Boehner indirectly acknowledged this week with a five-point tweet that listed ... nothing. But they talk about austerity and cutting spending, exactly what Europe did to catastrophic effect. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Aid for College Is Missing the Mark", "Date": "2014-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneNearly two decades later, it seems, he was broadly right. Indeed, he didn\u2019t know the half of it.It\u2019s not just that many colleges and universities are bleeding taxpayers. The government\u2019s overall strategy to subsidize higher education is failing at its core task: providing less privileged Americans with a real shot at a college degree. Alarmingly, it is burdening low-income students with risks they cannot bear and steering them into low-quality educations.\u201cInstitutions of higher education in the United States extract a lot of money without delivering value but the government has no way of influencing that,\u201d said Andreas Schleicher, the top education expert at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the research organization for the world\u2019s major industrial powers. \u201cIt has very few levers of control over equity-related issues.\u201dThey found that for-profits that get federal subsidies charge, on average, 78 percent more than for-profit institutions that are not eligible for aid. The price difference is almost identical to the value of the subsidy. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to infer that federal student aid system is kind of allowing that to happen,\u201d Professor Cellini told me.The United States shares two dubious distinctions. It has the most expensive higher education in the world: $26,000 a year, on average. And the college graduation rates of America\u2019s young are growing at nearly the slowest pace in the industrial world, the third from the bottom among 30 nations tracked by the O.E.C.D.In 2012, 44 percent of 25- to 34-year-old Americans had a college degree, whether from a community college or an ivy league university, 6 percentage points more than in 2000. By contrast, the college graduation rate of young Britons rose by 19 percentage points over the period, to 49 percent. In the O.E.C.D. as a whole it increased to 40 percent, 14 percentage points more than in 2000.Poor youths are the ones being left out. According to O.E.C.D. data, socioeconomic status has a bigger impact on college attainment in the United States than in most nations at a similar level of development. College enrollment after the first year is five times as high for high-income students as for low-income youths, studies show.Low-income students in the United States often end up with the short straw: no degree, no job and a bundle of debt that they must pay anyway.American underperformance reflects underlying inequities that are deeper than in any other rich country. But what is even more disturbing is that government support sometimes contributes to the nation\u2019s educational disparities.\u201cSome for-profits provide value for students,\u201d Professor Cellini told me. \u201cBut on average they are slightly worse than community college in terms of earnings after graduation and they are way more expensive.\u201d Given this, she said, \u201cWhy would you go?\u201dThe bigger question is why the American government finances them, even as public education is shriveling from a lack of cash.There are better ways to finance higher education. In Norway, where the state picks up the bill and students pay no tuition, 44 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds have a degree from a four-year college, compared to 34 percent of Americans.But the United States needn\u2019t become Scandinavian. British universities also charge fairly high tuition, but Britain manages to provide universal public funding while avoiding many of the pitfalls of the American system of college finance.Like the United States, Britain relies heavily on loans, available to every college-bound student. That is where the similarities end. The British government imposes tight quality controls to ensure higher education is up to scratch. What\u2019s more, graduates pay back only what they can afford: 9 percent of their annual earnings over \u00a321,000 ($34,000). Any unpaid balance is forgiven after 30 years.Most controversially, the government controls prices: Tuition can be no more than \u00a39,000 ($15,000). The government will directly finance the extra costs of expensive careers like engineering or medicine. But colleges can charge no more.The Obama administration is moving, timidly, in this direction, introducing income-contingent loans to the federal aid portfolio. But there is a long way to go.The argument is not, as Mr. Bennett might have had it in 1987, that federal aid should be pared back or eliminated. The case for government financing of college is as strong as ever.A college education is not only immensely valuable to graduates, it produces huge value to the rest of society.But the way we subsidize college today, we are wasting both money and opportunity.The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about college aid for lower-income students, misspelled the middle name of a researcher who looked into for-profit colleges. She is Stephanie Riegg Cellini (not Rieg).A correction in this space on Thursday about college aid for lower-income students misidentified the column in which the error appeared. It was the Economic Scene column \u2014 not Common Sense, another Business Day column, written by James B. Stewart.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clashing Visions of Conservation Shake Brazil\u2019s Presidential Vote ", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by7 Photos\u201cThe mantra in Bras\u00edlia is that they have deforestation under control, but the evidence on the ground shows this is not true,\u201d said Philip M. Fearnside, a prominent researcher at the National Institute for Amazon Research in Manaus, the Amazon\u2019s largest city.Ms. Silva \u2014 the daughter of rubber tappers, raised in the far reaches of the rain forest \u2014 wants to shift toward energy sources viewed as having less of an impact on the environment. With the Amazon gaining importance as a strategic pillar of Brazil\u2019s economy \u2014 which is the largest in Latin America \u2014 the jump in deforestation has each candidate lashing out at the other.\u201cI want to know where the setbacks have been,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said in one caustic remark directed at Ms. Silva in their exchanges over deforestation.\u201cDeforestation is rising again because of incompetence, inefficiency and a lack of commitment in protecting the Amazon,\u201d said Ms. Silva. After surging in the opinion polls in September, she has tried to dispel criticism over policies that some voters see as threatening to large-scale agriculture in the Amazon and other regions.The challenges of balancing conservation and economic development in the world\u2019s largest remaining area of tropical forest come into sharp relief here in the turbulent region around Novo Progresso, a remote settlement of gold miners, cattle ranchers and loggers on the BR-163, a highway cutting across the Amazon.Before Ms. Silva broke from the governing Workers Party in 2009, she oversaw a plan to bolster conservation along the road, which runs more than 1,000 miles and connects the agricultural heartland of Mato Grosso to the port of Santar\u00e9m. Under the project, the road was to be paved, easing the way for commodities like soybeans to be exported to China.Both forest protection and the asphalting of the highway remain elusive goals. In Par\u00e1, a state almost twice the size of Texas, long stretches are still unpaved, producing a bone-rattling ride.When it rains, the BR-163 loses much of its resemblance to a road. Stalled trucks spin their wheels in the mud. Pickups try to avoid careering into potholes the size of kiddie pools. At some points, drivers simply arrange their vehicles in a remarkably orderly line and wait for the mud to dry, a process that can last a day or more.\u201cThis place is like a little bit of hell,\u201d said Eduardo Pimentel, 43, a truck driver.Around Novo Progresso, a cat-and-mouse game also plays out each day between land speculators and the environmental police, who fan out by helicopter over colossal stretches of public land to detect signs of fires and illegal logging, gold prospecting and cattle ranching.The stakes are huge. Agriculture continues to expand in the Amazon, while authorities are pursuing a new array of huge dams, raising tension across the immense hinterland.When the security forces here find new signs of illegal deforestation, they often act swiftly, arresting and fining those responsible. They destroy encampments and equipment, setting fire to tractors and logging trucks. Such methods helped lower annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by about 70 percent since 2000.Then there are tactics like deploying arsonist crews at times of heavy cloud cover or light rains, when detecting fires under the forest canopy by satellite is thought to be harder. Some have even set the forest alight by tossing Molotov cocktails from small planes, said Luciano de Meneses Evaristo, a top official at Brazil\u2019s environmental protection agency.\u201cThis is the Wild West of environmental crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are waging an endless war.\u201dStill, Mr. de Meneses Evaristo and other Brazilian officials say that measures taken over the last decade, like creating new national forests and blocking public loans to landowners who violate environmental regulations, have helped push the deforestation rate to historic lows, despite the recent increase.\u201cNo country has done more than Brazil to fight illegal deforestation,\u201d said Izabella Teixeira, Brazil\u2019s environment minister, pointing out that Brazilian law allows for certain amounts of legal deforestation, preventing the country from signing the United Nations agreement seeking to end deforestation.Though almost 20 percent of the Brazilian Amazon has been cleared since the 1960s and \u201970s, Ms. Teixeira said that Brazil could serve as an anti-deforestation example for the developing world. \u201cI would love for the forests of Indonesia or the Congo River Basin to have the same levels of protection we have forged,\u201d she added.Views differ on whether the alerts reflect another expansion of illegal deforestation, the legal burning of forest on private lands or fires set on previously cleared cattle pastures. Ms. Teixeira said she expected the overall deforestation rate to remain flat in 2014.\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing an increase in speculative deforestation and forest destruction for the government\u2019s own infrastructure projects,\u201d Mr. Ver\u00edssimo said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a rearrangement of priorities, with the Amazon targeted for massive investments. Naturally this opens the way for new deforestation.\u201dHere in Par\u00e1, a plan to build a complex of new dams around a tributary of the Amazon River is projected to increase forest loss. New roads are also expected to lure thousands of settlers, pressuring forest resources.Along the BR-163, violent land-grabs persist as speculators eye tracts for grazing cattle and logging. Near the town of Trair\u00e3o, Osvalinda Marcelino Alves Pereira, 45, recently registered death threats from loggers who accused her of being an informant for the environmental police.In the deforestation hot spot of Novo Progresso, residents openly chafe at the environmental police and other federal officials. \u201cGlobal warming is a lie concocted by interests in rich countries which covet Amazonia,\u201d said Agamenon da Silva Menezes, 63, a cattle rancher and business leader who arrived here in 1985, opening a supply depot for gold prospectors.Hostility against the authorities simmers here after federal investigators in August arrested members of what they described as one of the Amazon\u2019s largest land-grabbing gangs. The organization rapidly deforested lands around Novo Progresso before flipping them to buyers by using shell companies, prosecutors said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zambia\u2019s Acerbic Leader, Michael Sata, Dies at 77", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cause of his death, after months of largely unchronicled illness, was not made public.The Zambian government, and Mr. Sata himself, persistently denied suggestions that he had a terminal illness, even when he missed an appearance last month before the United Nations General Assembly in New York after reports that he had taken ill in his hotel room.Shortly before he left for New York, Mr. Sata mocked people who said he was sick. He was quoted as telling lawmakers at the opening of Parliament in Zambia\u2019s capital, Lusaka, \u201cI am not dead yet.\u201dMr. Sata flew to London 10 days ago for what the authorities called a \u201cmedical checkup abroad,\u201d without revealing his destination.The government met in Lusaka on Wednesday and chose Vice President Guy Scott to act as interim head of state until an election can be held to replace Mr. Sata, according to the defense minister, Edgar Lungu. The election is to be held within 90 days.Mr. Scott, who is white, becomes the first white leader of a sub-Saharan nation since F. W. de Klerk\u2019s tenure as president of South Africa ended in May 1994. Mr. Scott is a former farmer and government minister.In a telephone interview, the interim head of state noted that Zambia had a similar transition of power in 2008 after President Levy Mwanawasa died of a stroke while in office. \u201cThe last time we had this, it went quite smoothly,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not impossible, and it can be done.\u201dMichael Chilufya Sata was born on July 6, 1937, in Mpika, in the north of the country, which was then under British rule and known as Northern Rhodesia. He had scant formal education, and at one point joined a seminary intending to become a priest, according to a Zambian historian, Field Ruwe, quoted by Agence France-Presse.Instead he became a police officer, and at one point spent time in London, working as a sweeper and porter at a railroad station. On his return home, he entered politics, beginning in the labor movement. He rose to become governor of Lusaka and worked closely under two former presidents, Kenneth Kaunda and Frederick Chiluba, before joining the opposition in 2001.As a candidate, Mr. Sata had run on an explicit promise to protect workers from exploitation by China, and tapped into the nation\u2019s divide between rich and poor, pledging to share Zambia\u2019s wealth.Such was Mr. Sata\u2019s willingness to talk bluntly, even after winning office, that when a senior aide apologized for remarks that offended the leadership in South Africa, he said, \u201cYou cannot be diplomatic all the time.\u201dMr. Sata acquired a reputation for intolerance to political challengers. This year, for instance, an opposition leader, Frank Bwalya, faced defamation charges after likening Mr. Sata to a kind of potato that in local slang denotes a person who does not listen to others.But Mr. Sata\u2019s style seemed far less despotic than that of some other African leaders, including President Robert G. Mugabe in neighboring Zimbabwe, with whom he cultivated friendly relations. Though at times Mr. Sata praised Mr. Mugabe\u2019s anti-white policies, he nonetheless worked closely with Mr. Scott while in the opposition and chose him as his vice president.Mr. Sata died at the private King Edward VII hospital in London. His wife, Christine Kaseba, and his son, Mulenga Sata, were at his bedside, according to Roland Msiska, the cabinet secretary in Lusaka.The president\u2019s absence from Lusaka meant that he missed a milestone of Zambia\u2019s history: the celebration last week of 50 years of independence from Britain.Zambia has an enviable track record in sub-Saharan Africa, suffering little of the ethnic strife or political chaos that has plagued some of its neighbors, like the Democratic Republic of Congo or Mozambique.Several government ministers began jockeying to take over after Mr. Sata\u2019s illness was reported, but few Zambians fear the outbreak of a violent succession battle.Mr. Scott, the acting head of state, is prohibited by the Constitution from becoming the permanent president, his critics say, because his parents were not born in Zambia.Marc Santora contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Officials haven\u2019t said much about what kinds of profits will qualify for the lower rate or what it will be.

The flip side of that is they should have a strategy in place, and not one that is driven by what the market did in the past three hours.\u201dSome financial advisers emailed letters to their clients this week, urging them to ignore the headlines \u2014 a sound idea for investors who are trying to ascertain if their overall approach is still working. Are stocks overvalued? Possibly. Will a slowing European economy destabilize the faltering recovery here in the United States? Perhaps. Is this a moment to get a better grip on the bond market? Absolutely.The point is, nobody can predict what will happen; the stock market is, and always has been, a gamble. But the right combination of stocks and bonds can reduce overall risks, even in dire circumstances. Investors holding all of their money in stocks during the downturn of 2008 to 2009 had to wait three years to break even, according to Vanguard. But people with investments split evenly between stocks and bonds recovered just 18 months later.Here are some ideas on how to ensure your portfolio is still working for you:Also on Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly fell below 2 percent, crossing a symbolic threshold that signaled investors were rushing for safety; bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, so prices on longer-term bonds increased.In other words, diversification worked: while stocks slumped, longer-term bond prices picked up some of the slack. \u201cThe market declines are pretty normal,\u201d said Fran Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard\u2019s Investment Strategy Group. \u201cBut the good news is that diversified portfolios are seeing a rally in high-quality, fixed-income investments.\u201dAnd when you consider that most people don\u2019t \u2014 or at least shouldn\u2019t \u2014 have 100 percent of their money invested in large American stocks, the losses aren\u2019t as severe.Investors can find some different combinations of stocks and bonds that can serve as guideposts, including those outlined in Mr. Ferri\u2019s book. For example, people who are three to five years from retirement with a moderate tolerance for risk might split their money evenly between stocks and bonds, though a more conservative investor might put only 30 percent in stocks. A younger saver early in her career, for instance, might consider anywhere from 60 to 80 percent in stocks, he said.But it\u2019s not quite that easy, either. \u201cFinding the right asset allocation isn\u2019t as simple as \u2018your age in bonds,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said, referring to the old maxim. \u201cThere are many 70-year-old people who can and should have more than 30 percent in stocks, and there are many 30-year-old investors who have difficulty with 70 percent in stocks.\u201d\u201cMake sure your bonds are high-quality, or mostly U.S. government-backed,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cThe last thing you need is your bonds to get crushed when your stocks do, as what happened to many in 2008 and 2009. Bonds need to be boring and hold value.\u201dA bond\u2019s \u201cduration,\u201d measured in years, will provide a general idea of how a bond fund might behave if interest rates were to fluctuate. It\u2019s a rough measure, but generally speaking, for every percentage point that interest rates rise (or fall), a bond\u2019s value will decline (or increase) by its duration. Bonds with shorter durations are less sensitive to interest rates (the faster the bond matures, the more quickly you can reinvest the money at a potentially higher interest rate.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Federal Budget Deficit Is Back to Normal", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsThe federal budget deficit has narrowed sharply, and is back to relatively normal levels.It\u2019s a nice idea in theory, but in practice, a complete accounting of the factors that have narrowed the deficit is not possible. Even so, we can see something by juxtaposing two simple facts. It is surely the case that the economy is operating further below its capacity than it has, on average, over the past 40 years. And the budget deficit is also below its average over the same period. It follows then that any cyclically adjusted measure of the budget shows that fiscal policy is substantially tighter than its long-run average.The harder question is not whether fiscal policy is relatively tight \u2014 it is \u2014 but rather whether tight fiscal policy is appropriate.In terms of political implications, the Democrats may try to use the shrinking budget deficit as an argument to try to win support from fiscally conservative Republicans. But the reality of recent budget numbers is unlikely to win them much, because it stands so starkly at odds with the broader public perception that the deficit remains much larger than it really is.Advertisement"}

But she believes she saw his handiwork.She worked her way up from sewing machine operator to plant manager, watching as jobs moved overseas and until the plant finally closed in 1995. Her introduction to Mr. Perdue came more recently, in a campaign advertisement attacking him as the man responsible for her career\u2019s demise. She would never vote for him, said Ms. Barnette, 69, who finished her working days at a car dealership earning a fraction of her previous salary. But she does not hold him personally responsible.\u201cThey were just caught up in the hurry of everybody going offshore, including him, and they weren\u2019t thinking about the people getting hurt,\u201d she said.Now it is Mr. Perdue who may be feeling the pain.On Monday, campaigning at the hip Swheat Market and Organic Grocery on Cartersville\u2019s main drag, just around the corner from the deteriorating Spring City Technology Park that was once Sara Lee\u2019s plant, he tried to free himself from the plant\u2019s shadow. \u201cOne man does not decimate an entire industry,\u201d he said.\"We\u2019ve had several industries \u2014 apparel, textile, footwear, electronics, even furniture \u2014 over the last 30, 40 years decimated by policies that put our manufacturers at a disadvantage relative to the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to put that back on me individually, and that\u2019s a distraction away from the very policies that this administration is perpetrating right now.\u201dDemocratic officials looked at the strong-jawed executive with the soft Georgia accent and saw a political outsider who could become a senator from central casting. He has \u201cpresidential timber,\u201d one Democratic strategist said.In conservative Georgia, the attacks may have dented his appeal, but he maintains strong support, even among those directly targeted by Ms. Nunn\u2019s barrage of hits on his business years.

Georgia\u2019s early voting has already begun.The recession hit Georgia unusually hard. Its sprawl, especially around Atlanta, had built an economy heavily dependent on home building and real estate. But its manufacturing sector was also skewed toward building materials like wood products, flooring and carpeting. And growth depended on in-migration of plants, regional offices and corporate headquarters from all over the country.All of that was wiped out by the financial crisis, which also shut more banks in Georgia than anywhere else, destroying relationship-based lending and hurting small business. Home prices fell 28 percent, wiping out the equity used for lending collateral, Mr. Humphreys said.The resulting dislocation and uncertainty have hollowed out the middle, creating political openings for both Mr. Perdue and Ms. Nunn. North on Interstate 75, Dalton, the \u201ccarpet capital of the world,\u201d has the highest municipal unemployment rate in the state, 10.7 percent.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money in Dalton,\u201d said Melodie Church, an interior designer getting her hair done at Tease Salon in town. She was interrupted by Tera Clelland, who was cutting her hair.\u201cBut there\u2019s no middle class,\u201d Ms. Clelland said.Ms. Church agreed. \u201cIf the carpet business fell away, this would be a ghost town.\u201dMr. Perdue blames overregulation, high taxes and the health care changes of the \u201cObama-Nunn economy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the details of my contract negotiations,\u201d Mr. Perdue said Sunday night after a debate in Atlanta.\u201cThat complaint was settled five years after I left,\u201d he shot back. \u201cShe knows that.

And, he said, he had nothing to do with the three Sara Lee plants closed in Cartersville, Milledgeville and Wrightsville, Ga. He was living in Hong Kong at the time, expanding Sara Lee operations in Asia.\u201cI was in another hemisphere doing something totally independent of that, and they know it,\u201d he said of the Nunn campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Sees an Iran Deal That Could Avoid Congress ", "Date": "2014-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 No one knows if the Obama administration will manage in the next five weeks to strike what many in the White House consider the most important foreign policy deal of his presidency: an accord with Iran that would forestall its ability to make a nuclear weapon. But the White House has made one significant decision: If agreement is reached, President Obama will do everything in his power to avoid letting Congress vote on it. Even while negotiators argue over the number of centrifuges Iran would be allowed to spin and where inspectors could roam, the Iranians have signaled that they would accept, at least temporarily, a \u201csuspension\u201d of the stringent sanctions that have drastically cut their oil revenues and terminated their banking relationships with the West, according to American and Iranian officials. The Treasury Department, in a detailed study it declined to make public, has concluded Mr. Obama has the authority to suspend the vast majority of those sanctions without seeking a vote by Congress, officials say. But Mr. Obama cannot permanently terminate those sanctions. Only Congress can take that step. And even if Democrats held on to the Senate next month, Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers have concluded they would probably lose such a vote. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t seek congressional legislation in any comprehensive agreement for years,\u201d one senior official said. White House officials say Congress should not be surprised by this plan. They point to testimony earlier this year when top negotiators argued that the best way to assure that Iran complies with its obligations is a step-by-step suspension of sanctions \u2014 with the implicit understanding that the president could turn them back on as fast as he turned them off. But many members of Congress see the plan as an effort by the administration to freeze them out, a view shared by some Israeli officials who see a congressional vote as the best way to constrain the kind of deal that Mr. Obama might strike. Ms. Meehan says there \u201cis a role for Congress in our Iran policy,\u201d but members of Congress want a role larger than consultation and advice. An agreement between Iran and the countries it is negotiating with \u2014 the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China \u2014 would not be a formal treaty, and thus would not require a two-thirds vote of the Senate.The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat, said over the weekend that, \u201cIf a potential deal does not substantially and effectively dismantle Iran\u2019s illicit nuclear weapons program, I expect Congress will respond. An agreement cannot allow Iran to be a threshold nuclear state.\u201d He has sponsored legislation to tighten sanctions if no agreement is reached by Nov. 24.A leading Republican critic of the negotiations, Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, added, \u201cCongress will not permit the president to unilaterally unravel Iran sanctions that passed the Senate in a 99 to 0 vote,\u201d a reference to the vote in 2010 that imposed what have become the toughest set of sanctions.Such declarations have the Obama administration concerned. And they are a reminder that for a deal to be struck with Iran, Mr. Obama must navigate not one negotiation, but three.Mr. Zarif, in an interview last summer, said that Mr. Obama \u201chas a harder job\u201d convincing Congress than he will have selling a deal in Tehran. That may be bluster, but it may not be entirely wrong.Many of the details of the negotiations remain cloaked. The lead negotiator, Wendy Sherman, the under secretary of state for political affairs and a leading candidate to become the State Department\u2019s No. 2 official next month, struck a deal with congressional leaders that enables her to avoid public testimony when the negotiations are underway. Instead, she conducts classified briefings for the key congressional committees. But it is clear that along with the fate of Iran\u2019s biggest nuclear sites \u2014 Natanz and Fordow, where uranium fuel is enriched, and a heavy-water reactor at Arak that many fear will be able to produce weapons-grade plutonium \u2014 the negotiations have focused intently on how sanctions would be suspended. To the Americans, the sanctions are their greatest leverage. For many ordinary Iranians, they are what this negotiation is all about: a chance to boost the economy, reconnect with the world and end Iran\u2019s status as a pariah state.For that reason, many think Mr. Obama\u2019s best option is to keep the negotiations going if a deal is not reached by the deadline, a possibility both Iranian and Russian officials have floated. But Mr. Obama is feeling pressure as well. Some cracks are appearing in the sanctions regime. In the spring, the administration was alarmed to see a spike in Chinese purchases of Iranian oil, seeming to undercut the sanctions. More recently the figures have declined again. Nonetheless they are the subject of behind-the-scenes talks between American and Chinese officials. And the Iranians want far more than a suspension of American-led sanctions: They are also pressing for an end to United Nations Security Council resolutions that bar \u201cdual use\u201d exports that have civilian uses but also could be used in nuclear and missile programs; those resolutions give the United States and its allies a legal basis for demanding inspections of shipments to Iran that could be part of a covert program.Inside America\u2019s intelligence agencies, the biggest concern is that Iran, concluding that its existing facilities are under too much scrutiny, would once again turn to covert means to obtain nuclear technology \u2014 buying it from the North Koreans, or building it in one of hundreds of tunnels. \u201cWe have not seen much lately,\u201d a senior intelligence official said. \u201cBut over the past 10 years, we\u2019ve uncovered three covert programs in Iran, and there\u2019s no reason to think there\u2019s not a fourth out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Monopsony Is Not O.K.", "Date": "2014-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon.com, the giant online retailer, has too much power, and it uses that power in ways that hurt America.O.K., I know that was kind of abrupt. But I wanted to get the central point out there right away, because discussions of Amazon tend, all too often, to get lost in side issues. And the same is true of Amazon today.Does Amazon really have robber-baron-type market power? When it comes to books, definitely. Amazon overwhelmingly dominates online book sales, with a market share comparable to Standard Oil\u2019s share of the refined oil market when it was broken up in 1911. Even if you look at total book sales, Amazon is by far the largest player.So far Amazon has not tried to exploit consumers. In fact, it has systematically kept prices low, to reinforce its dominance. What it has done, instead, is use its market power to put a squeeze on publishers, in effect driving down the prices it pays for books \u2014 hence the fight with Hachette. In economics jargon, Amazon is not, at least so far, acting like a monopolist, a dominant seller with the power to raise prices. Instead, it is acting as a monopsonist, a dominant buyer with the power to push prices down.And on that front its power is really immense \u2014 in fact, even greater than the market share numbers indicate. Book sales depend crucially on buzz and word of mouth (which is why authors are often sent on grueling book tours); you buy a book because you\u2019ve heard about it, because other people are reading it, because it\u2019s a topic of conversation, because it\u2019s made the best-seller list. And what Amazon possesses is the power to kill the buzz. It\u2019s definitely possible, with some extra effort, to buy a book you\u2019ve heard about even if Amazon doesn\u2019t carry it \u2014 but if Amazon doesn\u2019t carry that book, you\u2019re much less likely to hear about it in the first place.So can we trust Amazon not to abuse that power? The Hachette dispute has settled that question: no, we can\u2019t.It\u2019s not just about the money, although that\u2019s important: By putting the squeeze on publishers, Amazon is ultimately hurting authors and readers. But there\u2019s also the question of undue influence.Which brings us back to the key question. Don\u2019t tell me that Amazon is giving consumers what they want, or that it has earned its position. What matters is whether it has too much power, and is abusing that power. Well, it does, and it is.Charles M. Blow is off today. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secularist Win Is Confirmed in Tunisia", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTUNIS \u2014 Tunisia\u2019s election board confirmed on Wednesday night that the secular party Nidaa Tounes had won a decisive victory in the country\u2019s parliamentary elections, securing 85 seats and knocking the Islamist party Ennahda into second place, with 69 seats.The provisional results, which give Nidaa Tounes 39.71 percent of the vote and Ennahda 31.79 percent, were a blow for the Islamists who swept to power in the 2011 elections after the revolution that overthrew the government of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. The party led a coalition government for two years, but Ennahda and its coalition partners came under sharp criticism for failing to manage growing insecurity and a sliding economy and suffered at the polls for that.Nidaa Tounes is a new party, formed in 2012 and led by an 87-year-old statesman, Beji Caid Essebsi, who gathered businessmen, leftists, trade unionists and former members of the Ben Ali government to provide a counterweight to the Islamists.The party did not win enough seats in the 217-member assembly to form a government on its own, and it will be forced to seek coalition partners, a process that could mean lengthy negotiations with smaller parties. One new liberal democratic party, Afek Tounes, won eight seats and is a likely partner. But several other smaller parties that might have been natural coalition partners fared badly in the elections.The result nevertheless puts Mr. Essebsi in a good position. He is a candidate in the presidential election next month and is already the front-runner.The election brought several other upsets. The party of a soccer club owner, Slim Riahi, made a surprise showing, winning 16 seats, ahead of the leftist movement the Popular Front, which lost two politicians in assassinations last year and won 15 seats. Ennahda\u2019s former coalition partners survived with only five seats between them.Provisional results were announced for all the 27 constituencies in Tunisia and six constituencies encompassing Tunisians living abroad. Certified results are expected in several weeks.An article on Oct. 30 about the confirmation in Tunisia of an election victory by the secular Nidaa Tounes party over the Islamist Ennahda party misstated the number of seats won by a new liberal democratic party called Afek Tounes. It won eight, not 15.Advertisement"}

Primavera Gallery has a gracefully slender Art Nouveau vitrine, with flower-and-vine patterns of finely inlaid wood and mother-of-pearl framing glass windows, designed by Eugenio Quarti about 1900. In a more enlightened vein, at Martin du Louvre there\u2019s a set of nesting blocks for children designed by Gerrit Rietveld and Ko Verzuu in the early 1920s. In eight graduated sizes, each part painted a different color, it\u2019s a Modernist tool for teaching kids the Platonic order of the universe.Librairie Signatures, which specializes in letters, manuscripts and documents signed by famous people, has a handwritten letter from the Belgian Surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte.

As you wander through the exhibition, you may find yourself making connections between diverse, historically loaded objects. At Ariadne Galleries, there\u2019s a Roman sarcophagus from the third century A.D. that was unearthed near Florence sometime before 1743. Carved in relief across its front are four standing putti, each representing one of the four seasons, interspersed with four vases overflowing with seasonal foods. A small, reclining figure in the lower center represents a drunken Dionysus. (The Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo deaccessioned this piece in 2007.)Near that florid funerary sculpture is a Byzantine communion tabletop from the fifth or sixth century A.D.

Along the bottom edge, two neatly carved woolly sheep face an encircled cross in the center that symbolizes Jesus as the \u201cTrue Shepherd.\u201d Together, the sarcophagus and the tabletop prefigure centuries to come in which pagan and Christian belief systems would interweave and clash across Europe. A striking example of paganism\u2019s persistence is a sofa-size allegorical painting, from around 1670, by Gian Domenico Cerrini.

Mr. Whitlam\u2019s four children said their father died in a nursing home.Mr. Whitlam, who championed indigenous rights and equality for women, led the Australian Labor Party to victory in the 1972 election after 23 years in opposition. Once in power, his administration moved quickly to abolish capital punishment, university fees and military conscription. It also set aside funds for specialized hospitals and created a national health system, which still exists in altered form.Among Australians, Mr. Whitlam is credited for his early recognition of the government of China, now Australia\u2019s largest trading partner.Mr. Abbott, a member of the conservative Liberal Party, told Parliament on Tuesday: \u201cIn every sense, Gough Whitlam was a giant figure in this Parliament and in our public life. Whether you were for him or against him, it was his vision that drove our politics then and which still echoes through our public life four decades on.\u201dBut Mr. Whitlam is also remembered as the prime minister who was dismissed in 1975 by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s appointed representative in the Commonwealth of Australia, after his government fell into disarray. The move surprised Mr. Whitlam, as well as many Australians, who were unaware that the governor-general could remove a democratically elected prime minister from office.He lost an election in December 1975 to Malcolm Fraser, the Liberal leader who had been installed as caretaker prime minister. Mr. Whitlam\u2019s foresight in recognizing the government of China was remarkable, said Bob Hawke, a former Labor leader and prime minister. Mr. Whitlam\u2019s trip to China in 1971, when he was opposition leader, incurred the ire of the Australian government.\u201cTrade \u2014 wheat \u2014 was at stake,\u201d said Graham Freudenberg, Mr. Whitlam\u2019s press secretary, who traveled with him to Beijing. \u201cBut it was politically risky to go.\u201dMr. Freudenberg described a prevailing view in Australia that the war in Vietnam was one against \u201cthe downward threat of China and communism\u201d that threatened Australia. \u201cPeople denounced China as \u2018Red China,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. But Mr. Whitlam advocated formal diplomatic recognition. Members of Mr. Whitlam\u2019s party met Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing, and then left for Shanghai and Tokyo, even as the United States secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, was slipping into China to arrange meetings between Mr. Nixon and Mr. Zhou. \u201cIt was a coup for Whitlam to have gotten in first,\u201d Mr. Freudenberg said. He added that had he been told at the beginning of 1971 that he would either fly to the moon or go to China, he would have opted for the moon as the more probable destination. \u201cAustralia\u2019s relations with China were so fraught at that time,\u201d he said.Mr. Whitlam returned to China in 1973, as the first Australian prime minister to visit Beijing, and again met Mr. Zhou and Mao Zedong, the country\u2019s top leader. Mr. Whitlam also publicly opposed South Africa\u2019s system of apartheid, arguing against the sale of arms to South Africa and decreeing that the racially segregated Springboks rugby team would not be permitted to enter Australia, a ban maintained until apartheid ended in 1994.He also granted Papua New Guinea its independence in 1975, after transferring local government functions there in 1973. \u201cIt should never be forgotten that in making our own former colony independent, we as Australians enhance our own independence. Australia was never truly free until Papua New Guinea became truly free,\u201d Mr. Whitlam said then.Edward Gough Whitlam was born on July 11, 1916, in Melbourne. Survivors include three sons, Nicholas, Tony and Stephen, and a daughter, Catherine Whitlam.Mr. Whitlam was a pragmatic idealist who had been frustrated by Labor\u2019s long period in the wilderness before winning the mandate to govern, Mr. Hawke said, and he pushed rapid change once his government was installed. But this urgency and an inability to manage the economy effectively led to disarray, and Mr. Whitlam\u2019s leadership came to a sensational end.The conservative opposition, led by Mr. Fraser, in an attempt to force an early election in 1975, used its numbers in the Senate to block the government\u2019s budget. Revelations that two ministers had made covert arrangements to borrow funds \u2014 one from offshore to help develop Australia\u2019s resource industries \u2014 dogged the government, which also faced an inability to pay its employees.Mr. Fraser, who demanded an early election, appealed to Sir John Kerr, describing the circumstances as \u201cextraordinary and reprehensible.\u201dMr. Whitlam\u2019s time as prime minister ended, but not his legacy, according to some tributes issued Tuesday. \u201cGough Whitlam changed the way Australia thought about itself and gave the country a new destiny,\u201d said Paul Keating, a Labor prime minister from 1991 to 1996. \u201cA more inclusive and compassionate society at home \u2014 a more engaged and relevant country abroad.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the year that President Richard M.

(You know something special is happening when you plan to knock off for the day once you hit the next chapter break, and then sail past it.) This is a testament not to the simplicity of the work but to the exceptional skill and effort with which its author has constructed the narrative. \u201cThe Betrayers\u201d opens in Crimea, the sun-dappled tip of what until recently was Ukraine, where Baruch Kotler \u2014 Soviet dissident, Israeli minister, international personage \u2014 has absconded with Leora Rosenberg, his young mistress, after the affair is exposed in Israel. Somewhat surprisingly at this vulnerable moment, Kotler has decided to revisit the nation that sent him to the gulag. Customer service being what it is in Ukraine, their hotel has lost their reservation, and straining credibility once more, Kotler decides to take a humble room from one of the many supplicants at the bus terminal. He chooses a woman, Svetlana, who advertises her marriage to a Jewish man, initiating a novel-long theme: Those who made life in the Soviet Union so uncomfortable for Jews are now left pecking for crumbs of Jewish association in order to attract identity tourists like Kotler. But Kotler gets more than he bargained for: Svetlana\u2019s husband turns out to be Vladimir Tankilevich, his betrayer.

Bezmozgis feels like a more interesting writer here than he did in his amply lauded previous works, the story collection \u201cNatasha\u201d and the novel \u201cThe Free World.\u201d In his stories Bezmozgis often limited himself to prose, and feeling, so self-\u00addenying as to border on the anorexic, as if the author, learning to calibrate, would rather give up sentiment than risk sentimentality. In his debut novel, which stopped more than ended, Bezmozgis seemed to wrestle with the structural challenges of making a leap from stories to novels. Like that book, \u201cThe Betrayers\u201d is weakest at the end, when the time comes for tie-up and resolution. And, like the earlier novel, \u201cThe Betrayers\u201d feels like a very long short story rather than a novel \u2014 at just over 200 pages, most of them spent in Svetlana and Vladimir\u2019s small residence, it is a four-hander more than a saga. But if that\u2019s a flaw, who wants to be flawless? As Pascal (or Benjamin Franklin, to whom the saying is variously attributed) said, \u201cThis letter would have been shorter if I\u2019d had more time.\u201d In \u201cThe Betrayers,\u201d Bezmozgis\u2019s prose retains the extreme economy that won \u201cNatasha\u201d so many admirers, while rising to a whole new level of stylistic distinction. Kotler feels \u201cthe warm, birdlike weight\u201d of Leora\u2019s hands. Dialing a cellphone, he recalls \u201cthe solid, goading, reproachful machine\u201d inside an old-fashioned telephone booth. In the Tankilevich yard, a chicken cocks \u201cits pert, imbecilic head.\u201d Svetlana looks at Vladimir with \u201ca strange, rising fanaticism.\u201d Ideas \u201cirrigate\u201d hearts, lives are \u201csolaced,\u201d emotions \u201cgutter\u201d and silences are \u201cinhabited.\u201d On the page, these locutions walk the tightrope between lushness and exhibitionism with spectacular poise; they startle and delight, and focus our reading. But many writers are fine stylists; Bezmozgis has also developed a daunting feel for structure and craft. \u201cThe Betrayers\u201d offers a lesson for anyone who has taken for granted the Lit 101 notion that politics is an awkward presence in literature: In strictly subordinating its many political observations to the demands of character \u2014 the author never allows himself to show up and polemicize \u2014 it achieves a seamlessness that marks it as the most persuasive \u201cpolitical\u201d novel in years. And in creating antagonists who have a lot of catching up to do, Bezmozgis neatly avoids that ponderous feeling that takes hold whenever the author has to dispense exposition. Perhaps as a result \u2014 Bezmozgis has to wait for his characters to explain things \u2014 we don\u2019t find out for some time the full story of why Kotler\u2019s affair was exposed, nor about Kotler\u2019s time in the gulag until the novel has begun its final descent. In the meantime, we read hungrily on.But many writers are fine craftsmen; Bezmozgis\u2019s novel also emits a soft, counterintuitive wisdom. It is Kotler, the heroic dissident, who has calcified into a well-moated and self-satisfied, if basically decent, man, and his betrayer who invites sympathy not only because he is impoverished and ailing but because, while no saint, he committed his last real sin a very long time ago. As Vladimir tells Kotler: \u201cYou benefited from this gulag. You had 13 dark years followed by how many bright ones? . . . Am I living a normal life?\u201d And the keys to Vladimir\u2019s salvation \u2014 as a Jew, he is eligible to emigrate to Israel, but he wouldn\u2019t be accepted without public absolution from Kotler \u2014 rest in his victim\u2019s hands. Bezmozgis is equally astute on Kotler\u2019s relationship with his wife, Miriam \u2014 she is neither suffering saint nor miserable hound, but a strong, intelligent woman as aware of her desires as her flaws \u2014 and he doesn\u2019t savor or condemn Kotler\u2019s adultery. Instead, Bezmozgis challenges the idealized notion that spouses reunited after an ordeal like Kotler\u2019s are anything like the people they were before it began: \u201cTwo people who had long occupied cold solitary beds were brought together. Two old acquaintances, nearly strangers, were expected \u2014 by the world, by themselves \u2014 to leap into passionate embrace or slip into delicate intimacy. They had done their best.\u201d The novel is blissfully short on the sanctimonies that make such a mockery of the complexities of marriage in the political arena in our time. It is precisely because Miriam is rendered so subtly despite virtually no time on the page \u2014 as is Svetlana, Vladimir\u2019s wife \u2014 that it\u2019s so disappointing that Leora, Kotler\u2019s mistress, never exceeds two dimensions. She gets more attention than either of the other women, as if Bezmozgis intends to keep mining her character until she caves and comes to life. Instead, Leora recedes with each mention, never able to rise above her essentially thankless role. We can\u2019t imagine what drew her and Kotler together and, more important, who she is when she\u2019s not issuing stock objections to Kotler\u2019s authority. But this is a trifle. Even a novel as short as this has to make thousands of decisions; that Bezmozgis made so many so smartly feels like a small miracle. \u201cThe Betrayers\u201d can serve as a master class for fledgling writers, and an inspiration for any reader trying to figure out how novels will be saved.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s the N.F.L.\u2019s Incentive to Change?", "Date": "2014-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyThe N.F.L., from at least one perspective, has had a pretty rough month. In the span of a few days, as most everyone knows, a video surfaced depicting the Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking his future wife unconscious; then the Minnesota Vikings superstar Adrian Peterson was booked for purportedly whipping his 4-year-old son with a tree branch. All the while, a clutch of other players faced the consequences of their own ostensible involvement in domestic-violence incidents. But as pundits wondered if the scandals could mark the beginning of the end for America\u2019s favorite sport, the N.F.L.\u2019s television ratings surpassed their levels from a year earlier. The uptick points to a surprising reality: Despite all its current problems, pro football is positioned to not only weather its current storm, but also to sail through it toward greater prosperity.Boxing \u2014 another macho pastime populated by guys you might hesitate to invite to a merlot tasting \u2014 shows how a spectacle can lose its grip on the public. Once arguably the most popular sport in America, boxing has long since been divided into rival fiefs by promoters who sometimes seem to be auditioning for a Tarantino movie. N.F.L. teams, by contrast, operate in unison to protect one of the most micromanaged brands in existence. At the head of that collective is a commissioner with the broadest powers of any leader in sports. The \u201cno fun league\u201d lays down the law on everything from the color of socks players can wear to what celebrations are acceptable after a touchdown. (The league\u2019s most recent diktat: no dunking the ball over the goal post.) Whenever the league has faced threats in the past \u2014 gambling scandals or labor conflicts \u2014 franchise owners have generally snapped into formation behind the boss. \u201cFor all the talk about competition on the field,\u201d says Stefan Szymanski, a sports economist at the University of Michigan, \u201cit\u2019s really a socialist collective off the field.\u201dIn many ways, after all, N.F.L. football has transcended sports to become a mass-produced, highly managed and artfully promoted product. A growing body of research suggests that tastes for such products are powerfully stubborn. Bart Bronnenberg, an economist at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, along with Jean-Pierre Dub\u00e9 and Matthew Gentzkow, both of the University of Chicago, followed consumers who moved between states and noted that 40 percent of their buying behavior was determined by a steadfast loyalty to the packaged goods they knew from their previous residences, even if those brands weren\u2019t particularly popular in their new location. Those preferences, in fact, remained in place for decades. Sports fans often display similar loyalty. Following a sport means learning the rules, recognizing tactics and developing an appreciation for what makes a star better than a bench warmer. All that requires time, which may explain why the popularity of individual sports moves at a glacial pace, often by generation.For decades, professional football tried in vain to attract spectators from dominant sports, like baseball and college football, not to mention nearly forgotten ones such as six-day bicycle races. \u201cIt was by no means obvious that pro football would be the big winner back in the 1920s,\u201d says Richard Crepeau, a professor of history at the University of Central Florida and author of a new history of the league. As late as 1950, the future looked rocky for even the Green Bay Packers, one of the league\u2019s most historic franchises. According to Crepeau, only a sale of nondividend-paying stock and donations from local businessmen \u2014 as well as a suspiciously well timed fire at the Packers\u2019 training facility, which resulted in a large insurance payment \u2014 saved the team.The catalyst for pro football\u2019s breakthrough in the latter half of the 1950s and 1960s was the new medium of television. The sport\u2019s flow of play could be followed even on a grainy black-and-white screen, and its schedule slotted perfectly into the networks\u2019 need to fill long Sunday afternoons. The start-and-stop nature of the game also happened to offer natural ad breaks. Above all, the league was ahead of its time in seeing the potential to transform large men in hard helmets into mythical warriors. \u201cThe N.F.L. jumped into television and became a master at creating huge, larger-than-life characters,\u201d says Daniel Nathan, a professor of American studies at Skidmore College.Over time, the league, too, became larger than life \u2014 or at least larger than its natural audience of American males. But the N.F.L.\u2019s relative paucity of games seemed to have honed its ability to extract maximum revenue from every encounter. Its broadcasting deals generate around $5 billion in annual revenue, and an average game ticket fetches nearly $85 \u2014 three times the price of a Major League Baseball ticket. In recent years, the league has also transformed once-mundane events, like the player draft and the scouting combine, into made-for-TV extravaganzas. The N.F.L. now has revenue of $9.6 billion, according to Forbes, which far surpasses Major League Baseball, the next most lucrative sport, which takes in $7.1 billion.The N.F.L. has recently turned its collective attention to encouraging international interest. But building a foreign fan base takes time. For more immediate results, it has tried to appeal to the wives and girlfriends of existing fans. \u201cThe league has decided it\u2019s a lot easier to convince women in Ohio to watch football than it is to persuade someone in Beijing to tune in,\u201d says Michael Leeds, a professor of economics at Temple University. That is why, according to Leeds, the N.F.L. has a fiscal motivation to quickly and forcefully police its latest problem. The sport\u2019s concussion issue, a concern that strikes at the very heart of a violent game, may prove to be a more stubborn problem. But the N.F.L. has demonstrated a deft hand at tinkering with its product \u2014 rewriting the rules on everything from instant replay to hits to the head \u2014 as consumer habits change. After all, unlike sports such as soccer, which are governed by myriad national associations, the N.F.L. has the management structure in place to engineer the spectacle it desires.The league, meanwhile, has already found ways to expose its product to future generations. Szymanski told me that when he moved his family from Britain to Michigan three years ago, his two teenage sons were already N.F.L. fanatics \u2014 not because of television, but because of PlayStation. \u201cA new generation is consuming games in new ways,\u201d he says. \u201cThe gap between the virtual and the real is narrowing, and the N.F.L. is in an excellent position to capitalize on that.\u201d A virtual N.F.L. could offer fans the opportunity to play along with real games and compare their play calls with real ones. It might also allow fans a way to indulge their appetite for violence in a virtual world while allowing the real game to become safer.Research also suggests that early exposure makes all the difference. Lorenz Kueng, an assistant professor of finance at Northwestern University, co-wrote a recent study of Russian drinking habits, in which he found that men\u2019s preference for vodka or beer varied widely by generation and depended on the beverage\u2019s availability around when a person turned 18. \u201cThe research suggests,\u201d Kueng told me, \u201cthat your first exposure to a product could shape your long-term preference to a large degree.\u201d It\u2019s not a huge stretch to suggest that consumption habits for sports are just as persistent.Ian McGugan, who has won two Canadian National\nMagazine Awards, writes about business and economics\nin Toronto.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Country for Human Rights", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsBAKU, Azerbaijan \u2014 As human rights defenders, we must report that our own situation in Azerbaijan has been deteriorating fast. Two years ago, human rights groups across Europe worried that holding the Eurovision Song Contest in our country would only prop up Azerbaijan\u2019s increasingly intolerant regime. Now their fears have been confirmed. Just in the past year, we have seen a cascading series of arrests of human rights defenders on trumped-up charges.So imagine our dismay on hearing about Europe\u2019s latest approach to our country: The Council of Europe itself is holding a conference this Saturday and Sunday in Baku, on how to implement the European Convention on Human Rights. Those attending reportedly will include Judge Dean Spielmann, the president of the European Court of Human Rights, the very institution that is supposed to be the bulwark of our cause in Europe.It would be humorous were it not so tragic. There is only one reason for the choice of venue: It\u2019s Azerbaijan\u2019s turn, according to its place in the alphabet, to hold the chairmanship of the Council of Europe\u2019s Committee of Ministers. By all other measures, the decision makes no sense at all.Many leaders of the already limited number of independent nongovernmental organizations here are now in prison, most of them on sham charges of \u201cillegal entrepreneurship,\u201d abuse of power, state treason and tax evasion. Our European visitors probably won\u2019t get to see the 58-year-old human rights defender (and founding director of the Peace and Democracy Institute in Baku) Leyla Yunus. She was arrested on July 30 on charges of treason and other counts her lawyers say are fraudulent. Or her husband, Arif Yunus, 59, who was arrested six days later. On Sept. 23, according to the lawyers, Ms. Yunus was beaten by a guard at the Kurdakhany detention center, where she is being held.The Europeans probably won\u2019t visit Intigam Aliyev, either; he is a lawyer and human rights defender who was detained and charged on Aug. 8. There are serious concerns about the health of both Ms. Yunus and Mr. Aliyev, and indications that neither is receiving the medical attention they require.Nor will the Europeans meet Rasul Jafarov, a young pro-democracy activist arrested on Aug. 2. He was about to kick off a \u201cSports for Rights\u201d campaign protesting plans to hold the first-ever European Games in Baku in 2015, an event that has support from the international corporations BP, P&G, Tissot and others.Journalists have also been systematically targeted. Last month, a criminal case was opened against the investigative journalist and corruption fighter Khadija Ismayilova (no relationship to the co-author of this article), after she spoke in Strasbourg, France, at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. She is now at risk of joining almost a dozen other journalists and bloggers who are already in prison. Then there is Anar Mammadli, the recipient of the Council of Europe\u2019s Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize. Sadly, our friend, who was honored just last month for his work on monitoring elections and other democratic rights, is currently serving a five-and-a-half-year prison sentence, handed down in May. All in all, Azerbaijan seems a particularly strange place to discuss the business of how better to implement human rights.A string of recent European Court judgments has taken Azerbaijan to task for a long list of serious rights abuses, including police torture and brutality, detention of political opponents, imprisonment of journalists, interference in elections and refusal to register legitimate civil society groups. Rather than uphold the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights, Azerbaijan has continued to use the law as a political club to silence critics. As in many countries whose economies run on oil revenues, Azerbaijan\u2019s corrupt ruling elite has no interest in implementing the rule of law, which would lead to its inevitable fall from power.In our view, it is a travesty that the Council of Europe is sponsoring a conference about human rights in Azerbaijan. The event will only be used cynically by the state-controlled media to add legitimacy to the current government, which tramples the rights that the Council of Europe seeks to defend.And still, the diplomats and European judges are planning to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aboard a Cargo Colossus", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA helicopter appeared in the sky over the North Sea.It was 7 a.m. on a Wednesday this summer, and the helicopter circled in a wide arc before hovering above a ship traveling south at about 15 knots. At more than 1,300 feet long, the ship, the Mary Maersk, was hard to miss. It is longer than the Eiffel Tower is high, and the Mary and its sister ships are the biggest container ships in the world. Feet appeared first from the helicopter, then a pair of Levi\u2019s, and gradually a man was lowered by rope onto the ship\u2019s deck. His job was to pilot the ship down a narrow dredged channel in the Weser River, toward the port of Bremerhaven, Germany.Later that morning, the Mary would undertake the largest-scale act of parallel parking ever \u2014 or at least since the last time it docked, the day before, in Gothenburg, Sweden. Until the late 1990s, the largest container ships could carry about 5,000 steel shipping containers, each about 20 feet long. Today, such ships are little more than chum. The size of container ships has exploded, reflecting their role as the packhorses of globalization. Each year, the maritime shipping industry transports nearly $13 trillion of goods, roughly 70 percent of total freight, according to the World Trade Organization. The Triple-E\u2019s can carry more than 18,000 containers, piled 20 high, with 10 above deck and 10 below. But they can sail only between Europe and Asia, as their nearly 194-foot wide hull is too large to fit into American ports or to slip through the Panama Canal.The Mary will stop at a dozen ports, going from Gdansk in Poland to Ningbo, Yantian and Shanghai in China. It carries seafood. It carries auto parts. It carries perfume, grated cheese and frozen pork. While computers and clothing are among China\u2019s biggest exports, chemicals and timber are more likely to leave Europe.The Mary \u2014 stacked so high with cargo that little is visible beyond two smokestacks and a glassed-in command center \u2014 is an apt symbol for an increasingly global marketplace. But it also represents the container shipping industry\u2019s overreaching ambitions. Few carriers besides Maersk are profitable, too many new ships are being built, and demand for space on container ships is slowing as economies in Europe and Asia face headwinds. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple logic, bigger is better,\u201d said Ulrik Sanders, global head of the shipping practice at Boston Consulting, \u201cif you can fill it.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s too much capacity in the market and that drives down prices,\u201d he continued. \u201cFrom an industry perspective, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. But from an individual company perspective, it makes a lot of sense. It\u2019s a very tricky thing.\u201d\u2018An Arms Race\u2019The captain wears Crocs. He is standing on the bridge, in black jeans and a white shirt with black stripes at the shoulders.The captain, Franz Holmberg, is an easygoing Dane. There is a tattoo on his left arm of an eagle fighting a dragon; he says the image is \u201cnot as vivid\u201d as it once was. A formidable camera rests among the bridge instruments \u2014 he likes to memorialize landscapes, such as the Suez Canal scene he uses as a screen saver.Not much happens on the ship, he says, but then he sits back on a couch just off the bridge and offers a few stories of the sea. Like the time a sailor thought the Danish queen, whose picture hangs in the dining room, began speaking to him. Or the time two Ghanaian stowaways were discovered huddled in a sealed crate. They had packed food in bags, and brought bags to defecate in. But after more than a week at sea, \u201cthey ran out of bags,\u201d the captain says.He came from a farming family, but decided to try a life at sea and got hooked. After graduating from nautical school, he was a third officer on a ship that carried 3,800 containers, a fifth of Mary\u2019s capacity.\u201cEvery time a new series comes out, everyone says this is it; it can\u2019t get any bigger,\u201d the captain says, adding, \u201cThen a few years after, they just add a little bit more.\u201dThe industry wants ships that carry more containers, more slowly. Fuel prices are a major factor, so ships now commonly \u201cslow steam\u201d to save fuel, cruising at 16 or 18 knots instead of 22. A typical trip from Poland to China takes 34 days.During a recent voyage to the Suez, the Mary\u2019s crew sailed on a parallel course with a 10-year-old Maersk container ship that held half as much cargo, but the Mary used only 6 percent more fuel. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen during the last 10, 15 years a dramatic increase in fuel costs,\u201d said Jacob Pedersen, an analyst at Sydbank, a Danish bank. \u201cThat gives them reason to get rid of the old uneconomic ships.\u201dWhen the world economy slackens, so does the shipping industry. At one end of Mary\u2019s route, the growth engine of China has been losing steam, while at the other, Europe is again flirting with recession.The shipping industry has also lacked significant consolidation, with shipping giants often seen as national assets. The top five container lines are either family- or state-controlled. Revenue at Maersk, publicly traded but family controlled, equals more than 14 percent of Denmark\u2019s gross domestic product.The bigger ships, though, have been sustained by a growth rate in containerization traffic that has been two and a half to three times global economic growth for decades \u2014 and that seems to be coming to an end.\u201cThere are two types of companies that will survive this,\u201d Mr. Sanders of Boston Consulting said. \u201cEither you have the very large companies like Maersk\u201d that \u201ctake advantage of scale and make money, or particular shipping lines that operate a niche where they dominate, like a feeder line out in Southeast Asia.\u201cThe other guys,\u201d he added, \u201care caught in the middle and will have a hard time to make a decent return.\u201dBoth Officer and MedicJens Boysen is the Mary\u2019s chief officer. Essentially, he is the captain\u2019s right-hand man.While the ships grow, the crews don\u2019t, in another economy of scale. The Mary has a multinational crew of 20 to 30 \u2014 and with so few, they multitask.Mr. Boysen, 35, is a blond, blue-eyed ethnic Dane who grew up in Germany. He doubles as medic, he explained during a tour of the ship\u2019s small medical bay, which has a bed, a shower and drawers stuffed with pills and transfusion packs. He recounted an episode on the Mediterranean. \u201cI had one motorman who, he was hammering on a shaft,\u201d he began. \u201cHe used the wrong tool so some metal peeled off and actually was penetrating through the boiler suit, so there was a lot of blood coming out.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t sure whether metal had lodged inside the man, so he approached the situation like an engineer.\u201cWe have a lot of magnets on board, so I just took a magnet to feel if there was something,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was actually some metal, but we couldn\u2019t get it removed, so we had to take him to the hospital later on.\u201dThe crewman was fine \u2014 problem solved.The cost of the crew and a range of other expenses related to running the vessel account for more than a quarter of the Maersk Line division\u2019s cost base. Fuel represents more than a fifth. Cutting such costs helps Maersk steady its results.In 2009, the company lost $1 billion. This year, Maersk is on track to make $4.5 billion in profit, according to Bloomberg.Back in the medical bay, Mr. Boysen pulls out a metal box marked \u201cdental\u201d from a drawer and looked up.\u201cI can also pull some teeth if you want.\u201dChina\u2019s Huge FootprintEarlier this year, the Nicaraguan government announced plans to build a new canal system, bankrolled by a Chinese billionaire, that would compete with Panama and be wide enough to accommodate the Triple-E. Such plans have been floated before and failed to materialize, but it is the kind of audacious project that only the Chinese might try.No country more than China has spurred the containerization boom, a byproduct of moving the world\u2019s factories thousands of miles from their biggest markets.Maersk is deeply embedded in China, with more than 20,000 employees there. It operates container terminals at seven Chinese ports, has bought 118 Chinese-made ships worth $3.5 billion and owns two Chinese factories that build containers.China is also exerting its influence on the industry. The country\u2019s regulators recently blocked an attempt by Maersk and two European rivals to form a partnership, saying it would hinder competition. Maersk recently proposed a less ambitious alliance with a single rival, the Mediterranean Shipping Company. The proposed deals represent a concession that cargo volume is not rebounding as quickly, so shippers need to share costs and cargo space. Boats are typically full heading west to Europe and partly empty heading east to China. Cargo from Europe to Asia has grown about 30 percent in the last five years, in part because of rising demand from a growing Chinese middle class. But it has not nearly filled all the containers.\u201cThis is still an attractive industry, but it will grow at a much lower multiple of global G.D.P.,\u201d he said. \u201cI really think that right now, given the size of container lines, given the level of sea freight, there is no benefit going toward bigger vessels.\u201dHow to Park a WhaleIt was time to park the world\u2019s largest container ship.Several hours had passed since the first pilot arrived by helicopter, and a second, Karsten Burckner, 45, had come aboard from a tugboat gangplank. Soon he was smoking cigarettes on the far end of the ship\u2019s bridge with the captain. He rolled them by hand, while the captain preferred his Marlboros.Mr. Burckner\u2019s job was to help turn large boats in front of the harbor at Bremerhaven and back them into their spot alongside the port where towering cranes would soon begin hoisting crates on and off the ships. Speedy, it is not.Three tugboats nudged the Mary, while the ship\u2019s twin engines fired in opposite directions. The ship began to rotate. It eased toward large rubber cushions on the dock. Beyond were steel shipping crates, stacked like dominoes and stretching out in a vast paved expanse in the port.

{"Headline": "Bloc in Europe Starts to Balk Over Austerity ", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILAN \u2014 With Europe once again rattling global markets, many of the largest European countries are now rebelling against the German gospel of belt-tightening and demanding more radical steps to reverse their slumping fortunes.One after another, European leaders arrived in Milan on Thursday for a summit meeting with their Asian counterparts, smiling for photographs despite gloomy financial news this week of stock markets tumbling and borrowing costs shooting up, especially in Greece, evoking memories of the euro crisis two years ago.In past years, however, the eurozone nations buckled under to German demands to slash budget deficits and roll back public services, and then watched in dismay as unemployment rates shot into the double digits and growth collapsed. Now, France, Italy and the European Central Bank have coalesced into a bloc against Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and they are insisting that Berlin change course.\u201cWe need to show that Europe is capable of investing in growth, and not only in rigor and austerity,\u201d said the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, speaking to reporters outside the conference center after presiding over the opening of the meeting. He described the international financial situation as \u201cvery delicate\u201d and said Europe had still not earned the confidence of international markets.\u201cAs the I.M.F. has said, we need to focus on growth,\u201d he said, referring to the International Monetary Fund.The divisions between Europe\u2019s leaders, at a moment when unity would seem critical, is one reason the markets are rattled \u2014 as well as the fact that policy makers still have not found a tool to revive growth in the face of staggering public debt.\u201cIt is the third phase of the crisis,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Godement, an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research organization.Politically and economically, Europe\u2019s central country remains Germany and its central figure remains Ms. Merkel, backed by Jens Weidmann, the head of the German central bank and long an advocate of monetary and fiscal discipline. Germany is the eurozone\u2019s biggest economic force, but it is now stumbling \u2014 even as its role as enforcer of austerity has made it a focus of fear, loathing and blame from some other European powers.France, which has in modern times been Germany\u2019s indispensable partner in European crisis management, is now in near revolt, and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has joined forces with Mr. Renzi, who has presented an expansionary 2015 budget that will cut taxes despite pressure from Brussels to meet deficit targets. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has pressed Germany to temper its insistence on budgetary discipline and to spend more on public works to stimulate the eurozone economy. The French have cheered him on. German leaders have resisted, while making clear their opposition to the more powerful stimulus measures that analysts expect the European Central Bank to deploy soon. Mr. Weidmann has become increasingly alienated from other members of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council in his refusal to countenance large-scale purchases of government bonds, the kind of stimulus that the Federal Reserve used to help revive the United States economy. Mr. Weidmann speaks for a large swath of the German public and was once a close adviser to Ms. Merkel.The political standoff has rattled international investors, who fear that European leaders are further apart than ever on how to pull the region\u2019s economy out of its long slump \u2014 and that the European Central Bank will not have the freedom to take the extraordinary measures needed to stave off another crisis.\u201cGerman resistance against the E.C.B. pursuing more aggressive policy is one of the things spooking markets,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist in London at Berenberg, a German bank.Ms. Merkel, for the moment, is showing the same inflexibility with her European partners as she has in earlier confrontations over eurozone policies.Before arriving in Milan, Ms. Merkel rejected any moves to loosen fiscal policy, including French requests for more flexibility on meeting deficit-reduction targets. Yet even in Germany, corporate leaders are growing frustrated that policy makers do not have answers amid persistent fears of deflation and concerns that the global economy is deteriorating.\u201cThe private sector in Germany has the feeling the government is not doing the right things,\u201d said Nicola Leibinger-Kamm\u00fcller, chief executive of Trumpf, a German maker of machinery that uses lasers to cut metal.Greece\u2019s long-term borrowing costs rose to nearly 9 percent, from 7 percent on Wednesday, to reach the highest level since January. In a pattern that raised uncomfortable memories of the dark days of 2010, the bond sell-off in Greece quickly spread to other nations with debt and growth problems, including Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland.Europe has already endured years of stagnation, high unemployment and a mounting public disillusionment that has fueled a political backlash, with right-wing, Euro-skeptic parties steadily gathering strength. In France, Mr. Hollande is suffering from rock-bottom poll numbers, while the right-wing National Front has gained ground. In Italy, Mr. Renzi remains popular, but anti-austerity sentiment is strong, especially resentment over budget cuts and a lack of growth.One of the reasons Mr. Renzi stepped out of the meeting to speak on Thursday afternoon was to address complaints from regional governments in Italy that have seen their budgets cut. \u201cIf Italy wants to restart, and we will restart it, we need to reduce the waste,\u201d he said. \u201cItalian families have already done it. It\u2019s now the turn of regional council members and representatives.\u201dMs. Merkel faces opposite pressures in Germany, as the more the European Central Bank does to head off deflation and to stimulate the economy, the greater risk of a backlash among fiscal conservatives in Germany.The party has drained votes from the Christian Democratic Union party of Ms. Merkel, a development that has probably encouraged her to take a hard line toward France after the French government said it would breach eurozone limits on national spending in an effort to stimulate the French economy.Yet there are small signs that a European reconciliation could be possible. The finance ministers of France and Germany will meet in Berlin on Monday to try to reassure citizens that they can continue to work together. And even as Ms. Merkel said on Thursday that there could be no exceptions to European Union rules on national deficit targets, according to Reuters, she had previously hinted at some wiggle room.During a recent speech to Parliament, she did not rule out measures to increase growth that would not conflict with her aim of achieving a balanced budget.Jim Yardley reported from Milan, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

{"Headline": "Getting Real About China", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorChina\u2019s harsh suppression of political dissent, from Hong Kong to Xinjiang, and its close ties to Russia, Iran and North Korea, have finally laid to rest the dream many Western leaders have had since the 1990s: that \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d would eventually, inevitably lead to more openness and democracy.Instead, the opposite has occurred: China is more confident, more assertive, and also more closed. Thirty-five years after Deng Xiaoping freed up the economy, the Communist Party is using material prosperity and nationalist ideology to maintain its legitimacy in the face of the wrenching social tensions. It has rejected both the move toward democracy and the acceptance of human and civil rights that Americans had hoped would emerge from China\u2019s astonishing economic rise. Even more worrisome, China\u2019s foreign policy relies on keenly calculated self-interest, at the expense of the international institutions, standards and obligations the United States has sought to champion. It increasingly views the United States as a rival and potential adversary.What went wrong?In the late 1970s, when the United States and China fully normalized relations, Beijing sought a strategic partnership with Washington, to deter a perceived Soviet threat. By the late 1980s, China was unconcerned about the Soviets, though willing to listen and learn from the United States military. The Chinese were especially impressed by our prowess in the 1991 Persian Gulf war. All the while, China built its agricultural, industrial and technological strength; military modernization was a second-tier priority. As late as 2005, China\u2019s admiration for the United States \u2014 and awareness of its own rising power \u2014 were such that a young, well-connected Communist Party leader told me, \u201cChina knows that you and Britain were best friends, and Britain gave you leadership of the world; China wants to be America\u2019s best friend, so you will give us leadership of the world.\u201dIf there was a turning point in China\u2019s assessment of America, it could be found in the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. While still respectful of our military might, China began to see the United States as a failing system, with a debt-saddled economy and a dysfunctional government, vulnerable to being replaced as the world\u2019s leader. In 2011, a well-placed Chinese associate told me that the country\u2019s new leadership intended to dominate the South China Sea; that its regional rivals, like Vietnam, would bow to its ambitions or \u201cbe taught a lesson\u201d; and that if the United States interfered, our assets would be targeted.By 2013, this associate\u2019s warnings had become even more ominous: \u201cWe can see your stealth aircraft\u201d; \u201cwe have our own GPS and can shoot down yours\u201d; \u201cwe know your technologies from all your companies and from NASA, because Chinese scientists work these for you\u201d; \u201cyou will not have any military relations with the Philippines unless we allow it, because China provides them $3.5 billion per month in remittances through Hong Kong\u201d; \u201cChinese shipyards are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week\u201d; \u201cmore than 30 ships were launched between October 2012 and April 2013\u201d; \u201cby 2019 China will have four aircraft carriers deployed.\u201dChina doesn\u2019t seek conflict \u2014 it can achieve most of its goals by adroitly combining traditional diplomacy with its vast economic power. But neither will it avoid conflict. It has in the past used its military \u201cpre-emptively\u201d rather than defensively. A danger is that an ascendant China seeking recognition of its power and rights, will, whether deliberately or through miscalculation, spark conflict.But the deeper strategic problem for America is China\u2019s more fundamental challenge to the global architecture of trade, law and peaceful resolution of disputes that the United States and its allies created after World War II. China\u2019s strategic rise \u2014 patient, nuanced and farsighted \u2014 threatens all of this. Just as the United States has sought the worldwide adoption of democratic values and American norms for international behavior, China will seek structures and relationships that support Communist Party rule at home, and its policy that countries should not intervene in one another\u2019s affairs.The ascendancy of naked and direct self-interest as an organizing principle would mean a fundamental weakening of Western institutions and values, including the rule of law. This would be a step backward, toward 19th-century ideas of the balance of power and spheres of influence. The question, as Henry A. Kissinger has framed it, is \u201cwhether China can work with us to create an international structure in which, perhaps for the first time in history, a rising state has been incorporated into an international system and strengthened peace and progress.\u201dIn analyzing China, the United States must look beyond historical parallels. In scale, China\u2019s economic growth, and the challenge it presents, is vastly greater than that of Japan in the 1980s. A century ago, Germany was an ascending power willing to wage war, but it never had the population or industrial capacity of the United States, or, until the 1930s, the leadership of a single political party, above the rule of law. Nor is China like the Soviet Union, economically isolated from the larger world. There is no historical precedent.For over two decades, the American strategy toward China has balanced between \u201cengagement\u201d and \u201ccontainment,\u201d a version of American policy toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The Obama administration\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia, announced in late 2011, was perceived as being directed against China, a shift toward containment. The United States has not only shifted forces but also updated defense treaties as part of this pivot. The United States is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an effort to create a large free-trade zone encompassing 11 other countries, but not China.As China presses its territorial claims on the South China Sea and East China Sea more forcefully \u2014 including even a claim, in some quarters, of jurisdiction over Okinawa, where American forces are based \u2014 the United States is being drawn into regional controversies. In the past few years we have found ourselves courted by Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries in the region, which are anxious for reassurance and support against China\u2019s new assertiveness, but also wary of provoking it. It will be in China\u2019s interest to force us progressively to choose, on issue after issue, between China and the interests of our allies in the region.The United States will emphasize multilateral forums for resolving disputes through international law, and fulfill our commitments to allies. China, in contrast, views this international order and these formalized obligations as being heavily tilted against it.We should be under no illusions about the difficult road ahead. China operates on a long-term vision, driven by its own interests. By some estimates, China\u2019s gross domestic product could surpass that of the United States sometime in the next decade. By then, Chinese military strength \u2014 including aircraft carriers, land-based aviation, submarines, and ballistic missile technologies, all of which could be directed against American aircraft carriers in the East and South China Seas \u2014 will be formidable. Even without any military confrontation, the balance of power in the western Pacific will shape the Chinese predisposition to push, threaten or compromise.The Chinese must understand that their expanding military capabilities have consequences. For example, the United States must not rule out the need to strengthen its ballistic missile defense system, as China rattles its intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities. We should be very candid in explaining this to the Chinese. China is closely observing events in Ukraine, and what our statements and actions there may mean for Asia. We must help China understand that a closer, more assertive alignment with Russia will only provoke the United States and our allies. The pivot to Asia makes sense, but must not come at the expense of our obligations to our allies in Europe and elsewhere.Even more important, America must work to persuade China that its interests lie not in narrow self-aggrandizement, like expanding its territorial reach, but in assuming shared responsibility for global leadership, commensurate with its wealth and power. The institutions of global governance \u2014 the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the like \u2014 have not been perfect, but they remain the best framework for securing peace and prosperity around the world. A China that turns its back on these institutions will find itself isolated and defensive, no matter how great its economic and military might.While Americans should hope that China embraces democracy and human rights in the long term, in the short run, we must accept that China has a right to its own system of government and its own standards for political legitimacy and social justice. The United States should insist that China, like every other member of the United Nations, abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We must help China see a distinction between its principle of \u201cnoninterference in internal matters of other states\u201d and respect for basic human rights and dignity. (For our part, we must also demonstrate our own acceptance of the responsibilities of global leadership by, for example, joining the International Criminal Court and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.) But we cannot assume that political development in China will happen as quickly as Americans would like.The view, increasingly prevalent in China, that it will inevitably replace the United States as the world\u2019s leading power is far from assured. Our natural resources, the rule of law, our entrepreneurial culture, and our vast head start in higher education and science are strong factors in our favor. People from all over the world want to live and work in the United States \u2014 including wealthy Chinese. They seek the protection of our laws and the individual freedoms they find here. China does not provide these attractions.If we are to retain our global leadership, and be a constructive, countervailing force as China rises, America needs a long-term strategic vision of our own: a strong, growing economy built on a foundation of energy independence; a vibrant, effective democracy; assertive, patient diplomacy backed by supportive allies; and a military capable of standing toe to toe with China in a crisis. With these pieces in place, we can succeed in helping China assume its rightful place as a global leader, and perhaps an equal of the United States, in a manner that promotes global prosperity and stability. Perhaps then China\u2019s leaders will feel secure enough to grant real democracy to its people. But it will be a long journey.Advertisement"}

The quality of it was just horrible.\u201dIn the closing days of the tumultuous race, Ms. Rousseff appeared to pull ahead in different opinion polls, suggesting that her government\u2019s emphasis on expanding social welfare programs and keeping unemployment low, even in a sluggish economy, had bolstered her support.\u201cLife has improved in the community where I live, so I\u2019m voting for Dilma,\u201d said Michele Albuquerque, 34, a manicurist who lives in Rocinha, one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s largest favelas, or slums. She mentioned rising incomes and better access to health care in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear choice for me: the poor population now has more rights.\u201dAs the economy entered a recession this year, an opening seemed possible for Mr. Neves, the scion of a political family from Minas Gerais, Brazil\u2019s second-most-populous state, who has vowed to adopt market-friendly policies like looser controls on fuel prices and independence for the central bank.Even as Mr. Neves and Ms. Rousseff have sparred about corruption and the tactics of each campaign, seeking to emphasize their differences, they retain remarkably similar positions on numerous issues.For instance, both express support for preserving subsidy payments for the poor, state control of giant companies like Petrobras and affirmative-action programs for Brazilians of African descent.But their differences on economic policy have accentuated certain rifts, with the challenger\u2019s call to resist Ms. Rousseff\u2019s efforts to assert greater state control over the economy resonating among many voters, especially in the middle and upper classes.\u201cA\u00e9cio will lure more foreign companies to Brazil, and that would help the country,\u201d said Lu\u00eds Ot\u00e1vio Melo, 55, an economist in Rio. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be corruption in any government, but at least with a new administration the thieves will be different.\u201dThe sense of polarization has grown especially acute in comparisons of Mr. Neves\u2019s high levels of support in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest and wealthiest state, with the strong backing for Ms. Rousseff in poorer regions of the country, like the northeast, where many rely on government subsidies.Whoever wins on Sunday will face the challenge of governing in a political system in which presidents must forge alliances with an array of different parties, including some with sharply different ideologies. The rising political tension in the country is not expected to make this process any easier.\u201cThe negative aspect of the presidential race sets the stage for the fractious political scene which will emerge on Monday,\u201d said Fernando Rodrigues, a columnist for the newspaper Folha de S.

{"Headline": "Demystifying the MOOC", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebook | Online EducationWhen massive open online courses first grabbed the spotlight in 2011, many saw in them promise of a revolutionary force that would disrupt traditional higher education by expanding access and reducing costs. The hope was that MOOCs \u2014 classes from elite universities, most of them free, in some cases enrolling hundreds of thousands of students each \u2014 would make it possible for anyone to acquire an education, from a villager in Turkey to a college dropout in the United States.There are several reasons for the disillusionment. First, the average student in a MOOC is not a Turkish villager with no other access to higher education but a young white American man with a bachelor\u2019s degree and a full-time job.\u201cThe basic MOOC is a great thing for the top 5 percent of the student body, but not a great thing for the bottom 95 percent,\u201d Dr. Thrun told me after he decided to shift the focus of his company last fall to concentrate on corporate and vocational training, and to charge a fee for courses.Nearly all MOOCs originate from the world\u2019s top universities. Their instructors are accustomed to teaching the brightest students, and may not understand the motivations, academic difficulties and self-discipline of the average student.What\u2019s more, for many instructors, the courses are on-the-job training in online education. Two-thirds of MOOC professors surveyed by The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2013 said they had never taught a fully online course before their first open online class. Many universities rushed their courses online in response to the initial hype, often choosing popular professors or volunteers rather than looking for the best teachers for the MOOC environment. A student who already has an advanced degree is far better equipped to navigate such a course, especially one covering difficult material.The best online professor in a subject may teach at the local college down the street. \u201cCould we be passing over a good instructor at a small college? Sure,\u201d says Daphne Koller, one of the founders of Coursera. \u201cWe have limited bandwidth to partner with individual professors.\u201dCoursera and edX, the two main MOOC providers, are essentially acting as gatekeepers for American higher education online, replicating in their virtual world the pecking order in the physical world as determined by U.S. News & World Report rankings. Top colleges have earned their place in the rankings mostly because they admit the smartest students, spend more money on academics than anyone else and bring in the most research dollars. None of those attributes matter to the students the two providers want to attract but aren\u2019t reaching.Many educators take the view that, using the metrics by which we judge traditional higher education (prestige, completion rates), MOOCs have failed to fulfill their original promise.But those metrics don\u2019t take into account how MOOCs are being used right now. Students can register, with no financial risk, for as many courses as they want. Some might want to sample a particular lecture, or prepare a business plan for investors, or take a lesson for a presentation the next day.Call it \u201cjust-in-time education.\u201d These students hadn\u2019t planned to complete the course, and they have nothing to lose when they stop taking it. The MOOC provides learning in chunks, at a student\u2019s own pace.Take Leo Cochrane, who already has a bachelor\u2019s degree but took a free online class from the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business to help expand his start-up air-purifying business. The course was perfect for the time-pressed entrepreneur. He had little inclination or money to follow a path that would take him to a traditional campus or even to an old-fashioned online course, with its rigid deadlines for lectures and completing assignments.With a MOOC, he could watch video lectures on his iPhone while running on a treadmill and pick and choose what he needed to learn from the syllabus. MOOCs put students in control. Students can do as much or as little as they want at any time, one reason that many never complete the courses. Roughly one in 10 finishes.The companies that rode to fame on the MOOC wave had visions (and still do) of offering unfettered elite education to the masses and driving down college tuition. But the sweet spot for MOOCs is far less inspirational and compelling. The courses have become an important supplement to classroom learning and a tool for professional development.That is the success story for massive open online courses as they graduate from the hype cycle\u2019s \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d into the \u201cslope of enlightenment,\u201d on their way to the \u201cplateau of productivity.\u201dJeffrey J.

{"Headline": "Modi\u2019s Idea of India", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIndia, V.S. Naipaul declared in 1976, is \u201ca wounded civilization,\u201d whose obvious political and economic dysfunction conceals a deeper intellectual crisis. As evidence, he pointed out some strange symptoms he noticed among upper-caste middle-class Hindus since his first visit to his ancestral country in 1962. These well-born Indians betrayed a craze for \u201cphoren\u201d consumer goods and approval from the West, as well as a self-important paranoia about the \u201cforeign hand.\u201d \u201cWithout the foreign chit,\u201d Mr. Naipaul concluded, \u201cIndians can have no confirmation of their own reality.\u201d Mr. Naipaul was also appalled by the prickly vanity of many Hindus who asserted that their holy scriptures already contained the discoveries and inventions of Western science, and that an India revitalized by its ancient wisdom would soon vanquish the decadent West. He was particularly wary of the \u201capocalyptic Hindu terms\u201d of such 19th-century religious revivalists as Swami Vivekananda, whose exhortation to nation-build through the ethic of the kshatriya (the warrior caste) has made him the central icon of India\u2019s new Hindu nationalist rulers. Despite his overgeneralizations, Mr. Naipaul\u2019s mapping of the upper-caste nationalist\u2019s id did create a useful meme of intellectual insecurity, confusion and aggressiveness. And this meme is increasingly recognizable again. Today a new generation of Indian nationalists lurches between victimhood and chauvinism, and with ominous implications. As the country appears to rise (and simultaneously fall), many ambitious members of a greatly expanded and fully global Hindu middle class feel frustrated in their demand for higher status from white Westerners. Narendra Modi, India\u2019s new prime minister and main ideologue of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is stoking old Hindu rage-and-shame over what he calls more than a thousand years of slavery under Muslim and British rule. Earlier this month, while India and Pakistan were engaging in their heaviest fighting in over a decade, Mr. Modi claimed that the \u201cenemy\u201d was now \u201cscreaming.\u201d Since Mr. Naipaul defined it, the apocalyptic Indian imagination has been enriched by the exploits of Hindu nationalists, such as the destruction in 1992 of the 16th-century Babri Masjid mosque, and the nuclear tests of 1998. Celebrating the tests in speeches in the late 1990s, including one entitled \u201cEk Aur Mahabharata\u201d (One More Mahabharata), the then head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (the National Volunteers Association, or R.S.S), the parent outfit of Hindu nationalists, claimed that Hindus, a \u201cheroic, intelligent race,\u201d had so far lacked proper weapons but were sure to prevail in the forthcoming showdown with demonic anti-Hindus, a broad category that includes Americans (who apparently best exemplify the worldwide \u201crise of inhumanity\u201d).A Harvard-trained economist called Subramanian Swamy recently demanded a public bonfire of canonical books by Indian historians \u2014 liberal and secular intellectuals who belong to what the R.S.S. chief in 2000 identified as that \u201cclass of bastards which tries to implant an alien culture in their land.\u201d Denounced by the numerous Hindu supremacists in social media as \u201csickular libtards\u201d and sepoys (the common name for Indian soldiers in British armies), these intellectuals apparently are Trojan horses of the West. They must be purged to realize Mr. Modi\u2019s vision in which India, once known as the \u201cgolden bird,\u201d will \u201crise again.\u201dMr. Modi doesn\u2019t seem to know that India\u2019s reputation as a \u201cgolden bird\u201d flourished during the long centuries when it was allegedly enslaved by Muslims. A range of esteemed scholars \u2014 from Sheldon Pollock to Jonardon Ganeri \u2014 have demonstrated beyond doubt that this period before British rule witnessed some of the greatest achievements in Indian philosophy, literature, music, painting and architecture. The psychic wounds Mr. Naipaul noticed among semi-Westernized upper-caste Hindus actually date to the Indian elite\u2019s humiliating encounter with the geopolitical and cultural dominance first of Europe and then of America. These wounds were caused, and are deepened, by failed attempts to match Western power through both mimicry and collaboration (though zealously anti-Western, Chinese nationalism has developed much more autonomously in comparison). Largely subterranean until it erupts, this ressentiment of the West among thwarted elites can assume a more treacherous form than the simple hatred and rejectionism of outfits such as Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and the Taliban. The intellectual history of right-wing Russian and Japanese nationalism reveals an ominously similar pattern as the vengeful nativism of Hindu nationalists: a recoil from craving Western approval into promoting religious-racial supremacy. The Russian elite, created by the hectic Westernizing ventures of Peter the Great, was the first to articulate the widespread sense of inadequacy and failure created in societies trying to catch up with the modern West. In 1836, Pyotr Chaadaev argued in \u201cFirst Philosophical Letter\u201d that, \u201cWe belong neither to the West nor to the East, and we possess the traditions of neither.\u201d His eloquent self-pity, which shook up Pushkin as well as Gogol and Tolstoy, inaugurated the semi-Westernized Russian elite\u2019s tormented search for a native identity to uphold against the West. In the 1920s, Russian thinkers exiled to Paris and other Western capitals by the Bolshevik revolution tried to reconfigure Russia\u2019s place between Europe and Asia with a doctrine they called Eurasianism. While approving of a monolithic economy and one-party rule, these hypernationalists exhorted a religious revival and unity across Russia to combat evil influences from the immoral West. In an astonishing development, their grandiose intellectual conceits have enjoyed both political imprimatur and popularity since the end of the Cold War, after Russia\u2019s apparent deception by a triumphalist West. Today, while annexing Crimea and throttling domestic critics, President Vladimir Putin quotes the religious theorist Nikolai Berdyaev, author of \u201cThe Russian Idea.\u201d And his cohorts in the media and the Orthodox Church circulate conspiracies that present the West as intent upon humiliating Russia with the help of NGOs, journalists, homosexuals and Pussy Riot.The perils of such ideological inebriation had already been illustrated by Japan\u2019s descent into unhinged anti-Western imperialism in the early 20th century. As Japan grew stronger, partly with the help of Western imperialists, only to bump up against their presence in Asia, the obsession with beating the West at its own game intensified. Like the votaries of the Russian Idea, many Japanese thinkers became as frantic about defining Japaneseness vis-\u00e0-vis the West as with championing strict state control of domestic society.The catch-all concept of kokutai \u2014 which roughly translates as \u201cnational polity embodied by the emperor\u201d \u2014 asserted Japan\u2019s evidently unparalleled virtues. Philosophers of the Kyoto School, like Nishida Kitaro and Watsuji Tetsuro, made more ambitious attempts to establish that the Japanese mode of cognition through intuition was both different from and superior to Western-style logical thinking. Such supercilious nativism provided the intellectual justification for Japan\u2019s brutal assault on China in the 1930s, and then the sudden attack on its most significant trading partner in 1941. Today, against the backdrop of a severe crisis of capitalism, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, like Mr. Putin, is asserting an unapologetic nationalism. Vowing to \u201ctake back Japan,\u201d partly by revising the country\u2019s pacifist Constitution, and disowning its previously expressed guilt for wartime brutalities, Mr. Abe has stoked tensions with China. This is just the kind of retrograde 1920s-style nationalist dogma that is making a big comeback in India, especially since last year, when Mr. Modi, a close ally of Mr. Abe, overcame the taint of various suspected crimes to launch his bid for supreme power. Interestingly, it is not the R.S.S.\u2019s khaki-shorts-wearing volunteers but rather quasi-Westernized Indians in the corporate-owned media and mysteriously well-funded think tanks, magazines and websites who have provided the ambient chorus for Mr. Modi\u2019s ascent to respectability. India\u2019s recent economic travails and diminished international standing have frustrated these rising Indians\u2019 sense of entitlement, provoking them to lash out at such handy scapegoats as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cOrientalist\u201d Westerners and Indian libtards and sepoys. Typical of their ersatz nativism is a book entitled \u201cThe New Clash of Civilizations,\u201d which gleefully heralds India\u2019s hegemony worldwide. It was written by Minhaz Merchant, the Anglicized former editor of a defunct lifestyle magazine called Gentleman and now a self-appointed publicist for the prime minister. Many such \u201cModi Toadies,\u201d as Salman Rushdie calls them, had Western tails once, like the Harvard-economist-turned-book-burner. Others still cling to those tails, such as the wealthy businessman called Rajiv Malhotra, hailed by Mr. Modi for \u201cglorifying our priceless heritage.\u201d Mr. Malhotra routinely puts out, from his perch in suburban New Jersey, popular screeds asserting that American and European churches, Ivy League academics, think tanks, NGOs and human-rights groups are trying to break up Mother India with the help of both dalits and sepoy intellectuals. Lest he be accused of irrationality, Mr. Malhotra also claims that the intuitive Indian worldview is not only different from but also cognitively superior to the logic-addled Western outlook. Mr. Malhotra has worked up his own version of the Russian Idea and kokutai with some piffle about the \u201cintegral unity\u201d of Indian philosophy, a notion that conflates very different Hindu and Buddhist traditions. In his North American redoubt, Mr. Malhotra runs workshops aimed at mass-producing \u201cintellectual kshatriyas\u201d (intellectual warriors).The fantasies of racial-religious revenge and redemption that breed in Western suburbs as well as posh Indian enclaves today speak of a vast spiritual desolation as well as a deepening intellectual crisis. Even Mr. Naipaul briefly succumbed to the pathology of mimic machismo he had despised (and, later, also identified among chauvinists in Muslim countries). He hailed the vandalizing by a Hindu mob of the Babri Masjid mosque in 1992, which triggered nationwide massacres of Muslims, as the sign of an overdue national \u201cawakening.\u201d There are many more such nonresident Indians in the West today, vicariously living history\u2019s violent drama in their restless exile: In Madison Square Garden, in New York, last month, more than 19,000 people cheered Mr. Modi\u2019s speech about ending India\u2019s millennium-long slavery. But hundreds of millions of uprooted Indians are also now fully exposed to demagoguery. In an unprecedented public intervention this month, the present chief of the R.S.S., who wants all Indian citizens to identify themselves as Hindus since India is a \u201cHindu nation,\u201d appeared on state television to rant against Muslim infiltrators and appeal for a boycott of Chinese goods. Such crude xenophobia, now officially sanctioned in Mr. Modi\u2019s India, seems only slightly less menacing than the previous R.S.S. chief\u2019s wishful thinking about one more Mahabharata against demonic anti-Hindus. Japan\u2019s expansionist gambles in China and the Pacific in the last century and, more recently, Russia\u2019s irredentism in Ukraine show that a mainstreamed rhetoric of national aggrandizement can quickly slide into reckless warmongering. Certainly, the ruling classes of wannabe superpowers have spawned a complex force: the ideology of anti-imperialist imperialism, which, forming an axis with the modern state and media and nuclear technology, can make Islamic fundamentalists seem toothless. One can only hope that India\u2019s democratic institutions are strong enough to constrain yet another wounded elite from breaking out for geopolitical and military manhood.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Court, Lawyer Calls E.C.B. Bond Plan \u2018an Egregious Extension\u2019 of Powers", "Date": "2014-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUXEMBOURG \u2014 Europe\u2019s highest appeals court heard arguments on Tuesday on a suit that aims to block a European Central Bank bond-buying program that has never been deployed \u2014 but whose mere announcement two years ago was widely credited with helping rescue the eurozone from market forces that could have destroyed it.The Court of Justice is not expected to rule until next year on the lawsuit, brought by a group of disgruntled Germans. But analysts were listening closely on Tuesday for indications of how the judges may be thinking about the legal issues.But Germans would never have approved European Union treaties if they had known they would allow the sharing of debt among member states, the court was told by Mr. Murswiek, who represents Peter Gauweiler, a member of the German Parliament who has been among the most vocal critics of central bank\u2019s policy and was among the original plaintiffs in the suit. Mr. Murswiek criticized the central bank for viewing \u201ceconomic expediencies as the only thing worth caring about.\u201dThe lawyer for the central bank, Hans-Georg Kamann, described the depth of the crisis faced by the eurozone when Mario Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, made his pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the single currency and, some months later, outlined the bond-buying plan.\u201cNumerous banks and companies started to prepare \u2014 more or less openly \u2014 for an end of the euro area even though member states and E.U. institutions never considered the possibility of terminating the euro,\u201d Mr. Kamann said. \u201cThe feared collapse threatened to become an uncontrolled self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201dMr. Kamann said the central bank\u2019s plan was proportionate and part of its monetary policy mandate to maintain price stability across the eurozone \u2014 not a form of overreaching that rode roughshod over economic policy making.As part of its mandate, the central bank \u201cputs out the fire in the specific building that\u2019s burning and, if necessary, in the adjoining buildings, too,\u201d Mr. Kamann said. The bond-buying plan was \u201ca necessary and appropriate reaction to the crisis in the summer of 2012,\u201d he said.Other parties to the case making arguments on Tuesday that were broadly supportive of the central bank were lawyers from some member states of the European Union including Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain.A lawyer representing the German government addressed the court with a comparatively cautious argument in favor of the central bank\u2019s bond-buying policy. \u201cThe E.C.B. does have wide discretion,\u201d the lawyer, Ulrich H\u00e4de, told the court. \u201cBut in using this, it must stay within the bounds of its mandate and the prohibition of monetary public finance.\u201dThe mere threat of intervention by the European Central Bank was enough to tame financial markets, and the bank never had to buy any bonds as part of that program. But the legality of bond buying by the central bank remains an issue because of expectations it will soon buy large quantities of government bonds to stimulate the flailing eurozone economy.Analysts do not expect the Court of Justice to place severe restrictions on the central bank\u2019s bond buying. But if the judges did so, the central bank could be deprived of a tool seen as essential to holding off the specter of deflation \u2014 a broad decline in prices that can undercut company profits and overall employment and growth. At 0.3 percent, the inflation rate in the eurozone is already worrisomely low, and well below the target of about 2 percent that the European Central Bank considers optimal for growth and financial stability.The suit, brought by a group of university professors as well as about 30,000 citizens who oppose using German funds to prop up the euro, was initially heard by the German constitutional court, which referred it to the Court of Justice of the European Union. In a decision that many legal experts criticized as muddled, the German high court reserved the right to block German participation in any bond buying by the European Central Bank, even if the Court of Justice has no objections to the central bank\u2019s plan.There has been a surge of discontent in Germany toward policies of the European Central Bank. In recent state elections, an anti-euro party, the Alternative for Germany, has been siphoning votes from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats.Many Germans fear that they would wind up paying if the European Central Bank buys government bonds from eurozone countries that later default. The central bank has already announced its intention to begin large-scale purchases of private-sector securities, and many analysts expect purchases of government bonds to begin next year.\u201cWhat worries me,\u201d Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank president, said in Bielefeld, Germany, \u201cis the danger that debt securities of poor quality could be purchased.\u201d He added: \u201cIt could also be the case that excessive prices could be paid.\u201dExpressing a sentiment widespread among Germans, Mr. Weidmann added, \u201cThen, without appropriate financial compensation, credit risks taken by private banks would be transferred to the central bank and in the end to taxpayers.\u201dMr. Weidmann is a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank but has often dissented from decisions made by the majority of other members. He has supported one of the crucial arguments of the lawsuit being heard Tuesday \u2014 that bond buying would violate a provision in the European Central Bank charter that prevents it from financing governments.If the European Central Bank did begin large-scale purchases of eurozone government debt, using the same kind of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d that the Federal Reserve used to revive the United States economy, it could probably not do so without the help of the Bundesbank. The European Central Bank has limited staff and often relies on the Bundesbank, with its much larger work force, to carry out operations in financial markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keeping the Pressure on Mr. Putin", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany knows a bit about dealing with Russia. She has spoken with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, more often than any other Western leader, and, more to the point, she grew up under Moscow\u2019s yoke in East Germany. So when she says that it\u2019s far too early to lift the sanctions imposed on Russia, Western capitals should listen.But why, some may ask, should lucrative economic dealings with Russia be curtailed when a cease-fire with Ukraine was agreed to on Sept. 5 and the crisis has abated? Russia has pulled most of its forces out of Ukraine \u2014 not that it ever acknowledged having any there \u2014 and negotiations are underway over a buffer zone along the Ukraine-Russia border and about resumption of gas deliveries to Ukraine.Here\u2019s why: Even setting aside the illegal annexation of Crimea and continuing fighting around Donetsk, the fact is that in the absence of pressure from the United States and the European Union, Mr. Putin has little incentive to make any concessions to Ukraine. Freezing the conflict, with pro-Russian insurgents in effective control of Ukraine\u2019s industrial southeast and negotiations plodding along indefinitely, suits him just fine.One of Mr. Putin\u2019s advantages in the conflict is that he has never revealed his hand. Even the annexation of Crimea was regarded in Western capitals as unlikely until it happened. In the Donbass region of southeastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin has simply denied that Russia is involved while actively backing Russia\u2019s proxies with arms and soldiers. When Ukrainian forces actually began to get the upper hand over the insurgents, Russia sent in more troops and arms, finally forcing the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, to settle for a cease-fire that was essentially a tactical victory for Mr. Putin. Mr. Putin\u2019s plan now seems to be to keep Ukraine out of NATO and the European Union, achieve de facto recognition of the annexation of Crimea and keep Ukraine weak. Control over southeastern Ukraine is one lever; gas supplies, trade and Ukrainian debt are the others. Mr. Poroshenko hopes to gain enough breathing room to start straightening out Ukraine\u2019s flailing economy so that he can start moving his country toward Europe. While the fighting may have ebbed, the struggle continues, and will for a long time to come. The Western sanctions are hurting Russia\u2019s sputtering economy, but that has not yet weakened popular support for Mr. Putin. Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s economy continues to disintegrate.Mr. Poroshenko has demonstrated courage and realism in dealing with Russia while insisting that his goal remains to join the European Union. If Ukraine is to have a fighting chance, the European Union and the United States must not waver in their support for Kiev or in their sanctions on Russia. \u201cSometimes in history one has to be prepared for the long haul,\u201d Ms. Merkel said recently, \u201cand not ask after four months if it still makes sense to keep up our demands.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Bank Cuts Forecast for Growth in Asia", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside AsiaSINGAPORE \u2014 The World Bank cut its 2014-2016 growth forecasts for developing East Asia, noting that China was likely to slow because of policies aimed at putting the economy on a more sustainable footing, and it also cautioned that Indonesia was a risk of capital flight.The Washington-based bank expects the developing East Asia and Pacific region to grow 6.9 percent in 2014 and 2015, down from the 7.1 percent rate it had previously forecast for both years. Growth in 2013 was 7.2 percent. The bank also trimmed its 2016 growth forecast for the region to 6.8 percent from 7.1 percent.\u201cThe main message of this report is one that I would categorize as cautious optimism,\u201d Sudhir Shetty, the East Asia and Pacific chief economist at the World Bank, said at a news briefing on Monday.Possible risks to the outlook include a weaker-than-expected recovery in global trade and any abrupt rise in global interest rates, the report said, adding that its baseline scenario was based on an orderly normalization of monetary policy in the United States.The World Bank said growth in China was likely to slow to 7.4 percent in 2014 and 7.2 percent in 2015, down from 7.7 percent in 2013. Growth in 2016 was seen at 7.1 percent. The bank had previously forecast China\u2019s growth at 7.6 percent in 2014 and 7.5 percent in 2015 and 2016.\u201cMeasures to contain local government debt, curb shadow banking and tackle excess capacity, high energy demand and high pollution will reduce investment and manufacturing output,\u201d the report said, referring to the outlook for China.The Chinese economy has struggled to recover from a soft start to the year \u2014 growth slowed to its weakest in 18 months in the first quarter. Beijing has indicated it is prepared to accept slower growth as it tries to wean its economy away from dependence on investment and exports in favor of consumption.But a slowdown in the housing market has become an increasing drag on the broader economy, prompting Beijing and local governments to step up efforts to restore momentum.When asked about the economic implications of the political unrest in Hong Kong, Mr. Shetty, the economist, said the impact on China\u2019s economy seemed limited at this point.\u201cWhat we anticipate is obviously a greater impact\u201d on Hong Kong, he said, \u201cso slower growth in 2014 than was being anticipated earlier. But at this stage our best estimates are that there isn\u2019t as yet significant spillover to the broader Chinese economy.\u201dThe report noted potential risks in the region\u2019s real estate markets. There was slim evidence of price bubbles in the larger economies, which limited chances of significant house price corrections, but an abrupt financial tightening could set off a disorderly adjustment of housing prices, the report said.On China, the bank said: \u201cA major nationwide correction in real estate prices in China remains unlikely, although there may be pressure on prices in several of the less rapidly growing provinces.\u201dExcluding China, growth in the developing countries of the East Asia and Pacific region will slow to 4.8 percent in 2014 from 5.2 percent in 2013 because of the slowing economies of Indonesia and Thailand, the World Bank said, adding that growth was likely to rise to 5.3 percent in 2015.While the region\u2019s vulnerabilities to capital-flow reversals have decreased over the past year, Indonesia remains relatively exposed due to its high short-term external financing needs, the report said.The United States Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates at some point next year. Analysts expect that a more aggressive tightening cycle by the Fed could lead to a destabilizing flight of capital from some emerging market economies.Broad risks to the region include the possibility of a slower-than-expected recovery in global demand and a rapid increase in interest rates, which could lead to debt-servicing problems in some of the region\u2019s countries, particularly outside governments, the World Bank said.Another risk to the region would be a sharp slowdown in China, but the likelihood of that is low, the World Bank said, partly because Beijing has fiscal buffers to provide economic stimulus or to bail out banks if bad loans emerge.

{"Headline": "A Winter Games Few Care to Host ", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn OlympicsOslo is withdrawing its bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics,\u00a0and as difficult as it once would have been to\u00a0believe, the contest to host those\u00a0Games appears to be reduced to\u00a0a dark-horse race between Beijing and Almaty, Kazakhstan.\u201cThe I.O.C. is guaranteed a dictatorship,\u201d said David Wallechinsky, the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians.This is a winter-shed moment for the International Olympic Committee; one that should not come as a shock but should be a cattle prod to broad and meaningful change.In a normal bidding cycle, both Beijing and Almaty would have been long shots, and not simply because of their dubious internal politics.Asia already has the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. It is hardly in a global movement\u2019s best interests to give a third straight Games to the same continent.Beijing hosted the Summer Olympics in 2008, and it is hardly in a global movement\u2019s best interests to give the Chinese capital \u2014 less than a generation later \u2014 the Winter Olympics as well when the pollution count in Beijing remains a lot higher than its mountains (the skiing events would be held 125 miles to the northwest in Zhangjiakou).As for Almaty, Kazakhstan\u2019s biggest city, it might well have been a worthwhile candidate a decade from now. It has a relatively compact Olympic plan and a developing winter sports culture. It staged the Winter Asian Games in 2011, has an Olympic bronze medalist, the men\u2019s figure skater Denis Tan, and will stage the Winter Universiade in 2017.But the I.O.C. just finished its big, fraught and extremely expensive developmental gamble with the Sochi Games in Russia last February. Why roll the dice again on Almaty, particularly when Human Rights Watch considers Kazakhstan\u2019s record poor and the I.O.C. just finished thrusting and parrying its way through President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s games in Sochi?What most I.O.C. members should want and surely do want after recent adventures and misadventures is a Winter Olympic return to the traditional power base of winter sports; a return to a safer haven where skiing and skating, not repression, could be the clear focus of attention.That should have meant Europe, but the Europeans \u2014 from Munich to Krakow to Stockholm to Oslo \u2014 all have bailed out.There have been deep concerns, in a relatively stagnant European economy, about costs; fears driven by Sochi\u2019s total price tag of $51 billion (its operational budget was much, much lower). There have been deep concerns about white elephants and environmental impact and, particularly in Oslo\u2019s case, there has been disenchantment with the I.O.C. and its recent messages and choices.\u201cWe are winter sports people, but this also shows we have brains and can see the bigger picture, and I think the Norwegian people should be proud of that,\u201d said Kjersti Buaas, a Norwegian snowboarder and four-time Olympian who competed in Sochi. \u201cI don\u2019t see this as a thing we\u2019re missing out on. I rather see it as an opportunity to take a stand against a big, big organization that not many people take a stand against. And that\u2019s the only way things are going to change.\u201dBuaas thinks her country was too divided on the Olympics to justify going ahead with the bid. But the Olympics might also have changed for the better and the greener if the Norwegians had decided to stage the Games and influence from within \u2014 as they did at the enchanting 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.Oslo 2022 presented some challenges that Lillehammer did not. The Alpine ski areas would have been a two-hour journey from the host city. But those are nothing to the challenges that Almaty and Beijing present.\u201cThe Western Europeans saying no is clearly a wake-up call, and we need to do something about it,\u201d said Gerhard Heiberg, the Norwegian I.O.C. member who was head of the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee and was a prime mover behind the Oslo bid.But as Heiberg points out, the I.O.C. already was discussing plenty of change before Oslo\u2019s decision. The new I.O.C. president Thomas Bach, with his Agenda 2020 initiative, is leading a serious attempt to rethink the bidding process and the Olympic sports program. The proof, of course, is in the revising, not the rethinking, but the wind does seem to be blowing toward lowering costs and focusing much harder on legacy issues \u2014 as well as working with prospective cities before they bid instead of simply judging them after they bid.The last time the I.O.C. had two or fewer candidates for an Olympics was for the 1984 Summer Games, when only Los Angeles was left to choose from. But it is also worth noting that the current bidding debacle does not apply to the Summer Olympics.The field for the next available Summer Games in 2024 looks robust so far (and much longer on democracy). Among the seriously interested: Paris, which would be celebrating the centennial of its staging of the 1924 Games; and four American cities: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington.\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating is that people are almost stepping over each other still to try to host the Summer Olympics, but the Winter Olympics are having a harder and harder time,\u201d Wallechinsky said. \u201cYou won\u2019t truly know if it\u2019s a crisis until you get the bids for the next Winter Olympics in 2026. But there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s a disturbing trend.\u201dThe global impact of a Winter Games is clearly less powerful. The number of major cities in reach of mountains big enough to stage a downhill is also limited. Climate change is beginning to be an impediment and will only be more of one in the cycles (and bidding cycles) ahead.There have been calls for the I.O.C. to delay the 2022 vote, scheduled for July 2015 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to allow for new options and candidates to surface. But Bach has ruled out, for now, any changes to the process or timeline.That seems only fair. How would the I.O.C. justify moving the goal posts on Almaty and Beijing after they have played by the rules and deadlines so far?But being left with a short list that is too short remains far from optimal. The I.O.C. does indeed appear to be guaranteed a dictatorship, and how it reacts from here is critical.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Depressing Signals the Markets Are Sending About the Global Economy", "Date": "2014-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFalling PricesEven if many Americans don\u2019t fully realize it yet\u2014though an unnerving drop in a wide range of global markets Wednesday may have gotten our collective attention\u2014the autumn has brought a rather darker set of worries with a series of dives in financial markets across the globe.On Wednesday alone, the Standard & Poor's 500 briefly fell into negative territory for the year and the interest rate investors were willing to accept on 10 year U.S. Treasury bonds edged below 2 percent for the first time since June 2013. (As of late morning, the S&P was down 1.4 percent for the day and narrowly up for the year, and the 10 year Treasury bond was back up to 2.05 percent).But those moves underlie a bigger story: Many crucial indicators in markets for international bonds, currency and commodities are pointing toward a heightened risk of a worldwide economic slowdown that may be beyond the ability of policy makers to halt. It would inevitably have ripple effects even on the relatively strong American economy.People who monitor the diverse global markets to understand what the future may hold are closely following these indicators.These two factors together mean that the change in government bond yields of advanced countries works as a convenient proxy for whether economic expectations are becoming more optimistic or more pessimistic.The signals are unambiguous. From the United States to Western Europe to Japan, long-term interest rates are falling.Now consider the backdrop in the United States: Through the first three-quarters of 2014, job creation has steadily improved and the Federal Reserve has followed through on its plans to end the buying of long-term bonds this year (and has strongly signaled it will hike interest rates next year). You knew all that back in December, so you would have expected that interest rates would be steady or even up significantly this year. And you would have been very wrong: Ten-year Treasury bonds yielded 3 percent to start the year, a figure now down to 2.2 percent.So something else is going on unrelated to the Fed or to the growth picture in the United States. And it seems to involve the outlook for inflation.But why would that be? After all, standard economic theory would suggest that if the economy is strengthening, it should push up inflation. Workers have a better shot at getting a raise now that the unemployment rate is under 6 percent than they did when it was double digits, for example.That\u2019s true, of course, but the United States is no island. And right now, there are some powerful forces pulling prices down from around the world.This development is terrible news for farmers and energy producers, but has benefits for ordinary people, who can gas up their car more cheaply and potentially feed themselves more cheaply. (The latter impact is most significant in poorer countries where food is a huge portion of people\u2019s expenses.)But what\u2019s the bigger story here? Why are food and fuel prices falling so sharply, and how much of the slump in global interest rates and inflation expectations does it explain? After all, if this was just a peculiar but temporary phenomenon, the moves in all these prices shouldn\u2019t give us much reason for concern about the future of the global economy.But if this was just a story of commodity prices falling, it\u2019s not clear why global investors would view that as anything more than a one-time shift. And the movement in bond prices isn\u2019t just on bonds that mature over the next two or three or five years, but in those that last for 10 or 20 or 30 years.Put all this together, and what is going on here? Here\u2019s what would seem to fit the evidence best:The world economy still hasn\u2019t recovered from the last recession. Moreover, investors lack confidence that policy makers have the tools they would need to avert a new slide into recession after years of throwing everything they have at it to try to encourage recovery and prevent deflation, or falling prices. Coincidentally, commodity prices are declining largely because of supply, but the timing of that decline is bad: It makes the risk of deflation that much more severe.Add it all up, and the markets aren\u2019t betting on catastrophe per se; if they were, stock prices would be down more. But they are betting that central banks and other policy makers aren\u2019t going to be able to get a handle on global deflationary forces that have been unleashed. That means we could be in for a slow grind in which global growth and inflation both stay below where people across the advanced world would like it to be.It\u2019s a lot better than being in the throes of a financial crisis the way the world was in the fall of 2008. But it\u2019s not a terribly sunny place to be six years later.Advertisement"}

He has already fired his workers, and he is struggling to make ends meet, providing for his wife and two teenage children.\u201cMy life became a fight trying to prevent regression, but I lost,\u201d said Mr. Heydarian, 46.With oil prices projected to fall even further, the oil-dependent government of Iran faces growing pressure to settle the nuclear standoff.\u201cThis is a new wild card, and we don\u2019t know how it will play out,\u201d one of the senior Western negotiators said the other day, as officials mapped out a strategy that they hope can achieve a deal in less than a month\u2019s time.Obama administration officials and the chief American negotiator, Wendy R. Sherman, were briefing lawmakers and allies last week on what has been agreed to and what issues remain in dispute, hoping to build support before an announcement.The Iranians may be preparing the way as well. The Iranian news media reported in recent days that the United States had agreed to allow Iran to operate about 4,000 of its most basic centrifuges. American officials have not confirmed the figure, but they have said that if they permit a higher number of centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium, then Iran would have to blend down or change the form of its current stocks of nuclear fuel.That would lengthen the time it would take to produce a weapon\u2019s worth of fuel, and after that it would take more time, months or years, to turn the fuel into a bomb. That would be a huge concession for Iran, which currently has 19,000 centrifuges, about 10,000 of which actually operate.Iranian officials would never admit that sanctions or low oil prices have any effect on their bargaining position. But for a country that by some estimates needs an oil price of more than $140 a barrel to balance its budget, the roughly 25 percent drop in oil prices to around $80 a barrel since last summer has to be deeply concerning.The precipitous decline could force the government to cut back popular benefits, like subsidies for gasoline and utilities and the $12 monthly cash benefit that many Iranians have come to consider a birthright. And it could have even broader effects, possibly sending the economy into recession.\u201cOil prices are bound to go down even further, and already the government faces big financial shortcomings,\u201d said Jamshid Edalatian, an economist and member of the chamber of commerce in Tehran, which is close to the government. \u201cWe need this nuclear deal, or we will face very hard times.\u201dMr. Rouhani and his chief negotiator, the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, seem acutely attuned to the damage done by sanctions. In an interview in Vienna in July, and again in appearances in New York last month, Mr. Zarif talked about the cost to Iran \u2014 while insisting that the country\u2019s reaction to pressure had been to build more centrifuges and a larger nuclear infrastructure. \u201cWhat has this accomplished for you?\u201d he asked his largely American audiences.But it is far from clear that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, shares that view. Traditionally, he has been less focused on Iran\u2019s economic future than on its status as a regional and world player. If Mr. Zarif goes home with a deal, American officials say, there is no guarantee that Ayatollah Khamenei will make a cost-benefit analysis about whether to approve it.\u201cThe decision is the supreme leader\u2019s to make, and we still don\u2019t understand much about his calculus,\u201d one senior American official said, declining to speak on the record about the talks.But the government has quietly begun to take measures to ease the losses in oil income, which are only now beginning to be felt since Iran typically sells its oil in three-month contracts.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.To cover an expected shortfall of nearly $2.25 billion in the coming three months, Mr. Rouhani announced this week that his government would dip into strategic financial reserves \u2014 which he said last year that the country did not have \u2014 to pay for continuing civil engineering projects.The hope all along for the West was that financial pressures would soften Tehran\u2019s negotiating stance, and they still might, particularly if the drop in oil prices proves to be more than transitory. However, most analysts here remain adamant that any such hopes are misplaced.\u201cThey will remain focused on getting a deal, but not any deal,\u201d said Ali Khorram, a former Iranian ambassador to China who is close to the negotiating team. He said that Iran had been taking lessons from Iraq and Libya: Iraq got stuck in the quagmire of sanctions by making halfhearted compromises; Libya, under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, ended its entire nuclear program in 2003, but the West\u2019s role in overthrowing Colonel Qaddafi made a deep impression on Tehran about the risks of giving up a potential nuclear capability.\u201cIt is clear for us, we either want a comprehensive deal or no deal at all,\u201d Mr. Khorram said, referring to the Iranian demand to retain an enrichment program while forging a step-by-step plan to cancel all sanctions.\u201cI\u2019m sure there is a Plan B if things go differently,\u201d he added.If there is such a plan, it is a well-kept secret.In Plan A, Mr. Rouhani\u2019s vision, a nuclear deal would lead to the lifting of all sanctions, and the Iranian economy would become a tempting prospect for foreign investors.The pro-government news media churn out items about foreign companies\u2019 showing interest in Iran, one of the last untouched markets in the world. This week, they reported that General Motors was interested in cooperating with Iran Khodro, Iran\u2019s largest car manufacturer. Billboards advertise iPhones (sanctions on computers and cellphones were lifted in 2013). On Thursday, Boeing reported selling its first products to Iran in 35 years \u2014 $120,000 worth of maps and information.\u201cWe are already victorious in the nuclear talks,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said, smiling, on state television last week, \u201cand will be triumphant with God\u2019s grace tomorrow, too, not only in this arena, but in many others.\u201dMr. Rouhani\u2019s insistence that a deal is inevitable is contagious, many Iranians say. \u201cOur leaders repeat this over and over again on television,\u201d Mr. Heydarian said. At Bahram\u2019s Barber Shop, near Tehran\u2019s busy Keshavarz Boulevard, all five seats were empty early Wednesday morning, so Isa, 35, had decided to polish a traditional teakettle. The television was switched to the news channel, but the barber was singing an Iranian song about hearts filled with love.Isa, who was uncomfortable giving his family name for fear of reprisals, said he had voted for Mr. Rouhani because he was the only one who was not a hard-liner. \u201cI believe in his promises,\u201d Isa said, \u201cmainly because the reality is something I prefer not to think about.\u201dThe government misses no opportunity to point out its successes, like bringing inflation down to around 25 percent from more than 40 percent and halting the decline in the national currency, the rial. The continuous injections of hope have led some Iranians to worry about a backlash of disappointment should the nuclear negotiations collapse.\u201cWe could very well see some civil protests in some cities,\u201d said Hamid Reza Jalaeipour, a sociologist and former reformist politician. \u201cBut Iranians are like sheets of copper: They can be folded and bended, but they never fall apart. We can adapt to bad times.\u201dIn the state-dominated news media, it is the good news that gets most of the attention. A government spokesman recently announced that the economy had grown at a rate of 9.5 percent in the third quarter. But many Iranians dismiss such figures.\u201cI don\u2019t know much about the economy,\u201d said Mahin Ranjbaran, 37, who sometimes washes dishes in a restaurant. \u201cBut my husband and two children and I have to live in with my parents, and we still cannot afford to pay the bills. That is how I measure improvement or decline.\u201dDavid E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fall in Oil Prices Poses a Problem for Russia, Iraq and Others", "Date": "2014-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A steep decline in oil prices is straining the budgets of major petroleum-exporting countries around the globe, raising a specter of spending cuts in Russia, where the economy is under pressure from Western sanctions, and posing a potentially grave security challenge for Iraq, which is already struggling to finance its fight against the Islamic State.From Moscow to Caracas, Riyadh to Baghdad, in Tehran, Algiers, Kuwait City and Lagos, political leaders, finance ministers and central bankers have been scrambling to confront the plunge in prices \u2014 roughly 25 percent since a peak in June \u2014 driven by increased production in the United States and by projections of sustained cuts in demand in many developed countries, as well as decelerating growth in China.The price drop is mostly welcome news in the developed world, and particularly in Washington. Countries like Russia, Iran and Venezuela that in recent years have sought to thwart America\u2019s influence could begin to moderate their behavior, as they come under growing financial pressure.While Russia maintains reserves of hundreds of billions of dollars as a cushion for precisely this sort of price drop, there are already signs of tensions here.At a meeting in Moscow this week with a government human rights council, President Vladimir V. Putin pointedly rebuffed a request for increased financing, citing the pinch from declining oil revenues.\u201cYou know that energy prices have fallen as well as for some of our other traditional products,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cDue to that, would we not, on the contrary, reconsider the budget toward reducing some spending?\u201d It was a notable departure from the bravado that Mr. Putin has shown in responding to Western economic sanctions over Ukraine, dismissing them as little more than an annoyance.In another sign of mounting pressure, a spokesman for the Russian state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, accused Saudi Arabia of secretly manipulating prices \u2014 an echo of conspiracy theories about American and Saudi collusion against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.Last week, Venezuela, which depends on oil for 95 percent of its export revenues, called for an emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to address the steep slide in prices, a move that other members rebuffed in favor of a regular meeting next month.The price of a barrel of Brent crude, a global benchmark, was $83.78 on Wednesday, down from about $115 per barrel since its high in June. Experts on energy policy say that prices are nearly certain to rebound in response to normal market forces and continued strong demand, particularly in the developing world. And some of the surplus that is dragging down oil markets is a result of production increases in Iraq and Libya, both struggling with instability that could shut down their oil fields at any time and send prices soaring.But in the near term, the big producers will probably face budget problems in varying degrees of severity, with an array of economic, strategic and political ramifications.\u201cIt depends how long and how sharp the decline, but if oil prices stay around 20 percent lower, that is going to be very challenging for countries that depend heavily on oil to meet their budget requirements,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, the director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York. \u201cMany of these countries have implicitly high break-even numbers.\u201dProfessor Bordoff said that Russia and Iraq faced particularly difficult circumstances, partly because of broader geopolitical tensions in each region. Russia, already squeezed by inflation and a drastic decline in the ruble, has found its ability to borrow money severely constrained by the sanctions. Iraq is facing a costly, and potentially open-ended, military conflict against the Islamic State.\u201cIf oil prices were to stay in the range they are in now, we\u2019ll see the Russian budget fall into deficit next year; that\u2019s on top of the economic challenges they are already facing from sanctions and the decline in the value of their currency,\u201d Professor Bordoff said. \u201cIraq has its own set of challenges with skyrocketing public expenditure requirements, large public payroll, food and energy subsidies. They need to rebuild a dilapidated armed forces.\u201dVenezuela has limited options in responding to the price decline, which leaves less money for social spending, government payrolls and subsidized imports of vital goods. The government could scale back on subsidized oil that it supplies to allies in South America and the Caribbean, including Nicaragua, Bolivia and Cuba. There is also some talk of raising the domestic price of gasoline, which is the cheapest in the world.In demanding urgent action by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister, Rafael Ram\u00edrez, has also thrown around conspiracy allegations. According to a government news release, Mr. Ram\u00edrez demanded \u201csome kind of action to stop the fall in the price of oil, especially since we are convinced that it does not result from fundamental market conditions but that there is price manipulation to create economic problems for the large oil-producing countries.\u201dThe major question now looming is if OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, will cut production and stabilize prices at a meeting next month. Some analysts say that is a logical step, while others suggest that Saudi Arabia may allow lower prices to persist, in part to squeeze its main rivals \u2014 Iran and Russia \u2014 and in part to put pressure on shale oil producers in the United States, whose higher production costs make it harder for them to compete when prices are lower abroad.Saudi Arabia\u2019s relatively low production costs and its domestic spending program allow for a balanced budget at a price of roughly $95 a barrel, compared with $100 or more for Russia and even more for Iran. Saudi Arabia also has huge cash reserves to prop up its budget while prices remain low.\u201cThe question is how much are you willing to eat into your cash reserves and for how long until you adjust your production down,\u201d said Gal Luft, co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, a Washington research organization focused on energy issues. \u201cIn the November meeting of OPEC you are going to see some of their members saying, \u2018We cannot live with those kind of prices; we are going bankrupt; we want to cut down production.\u2019\u201cThen you will have others, mainly Saudi Arabia, who might say, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t want to overreact.\u2019 In the short run, I think most of the players can survive,\u201d Mr. Luft said. \u201cIn the long run, beyond a year, I don\u2019t think they have the means.\u201dFor the United States and most of the developed world, a decline in oil prices is generally regarded as a macroeconomic plus, reducing costs for consumers and businesses and often lifting stock markets. That classical view has begun to change, however, as the United States has increased its own oil production, particularly in states like Texas and North Dakota.In Russia, the Kremlin and the Central Bank have insisted that there is no cause for panic. Official projections show oil prices rebounding to about $100 a barrel over the next three years, and government officials are adamant that the country\u2019s cash reserves are sufficient to weather temporarily low prices.In testimony before the lower house of Parliament on Monday, the head of Russia\u2019s Central Bank, Elvira S. Nabiullina, said that despite the government\u2019s confidence, the bank was assessing the risks of a severe and prolonged decline in oil prices, to $60 per barrel.\u201cThe central bank is currently working on a so-called stress scenario, emergency scenario so to say, which includes an abrupt, more noticeable oil price fall in a forecasted time span,\u201d Ms. Nabiullina said. \u201cNevertheless, I think there are low chances of this.\u201dMr. Luft, the Washington-based analyst, said it was hard to say whether the Saudis would eventually tighten the spigots in an effort to prop up prices, as they have in the past, or pursue a strategy of preserving market share, which means keeping prices relatively low.\u201cFrom them, what matters is how much money goes through the door,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care how many barrels they sold or pumped, but how much money in billions goes through the door. In the end, that\u2019s what it is all about. It\u2019s about staying alive, staying in power, making sure you don\u2019t end up like Mubarak.\u201dWilliam Neuman contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Japan, Small Gesture Holds Great Importance ", "Date": "2014-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The Japanese government has no shortage of issues to worry about \u2014 strengthening a faltering economic recovery and trying to persuade a skeptical public to accept a return to nuclear power. But even with all that, the country\u2019s leaders are devoting their energy to a seemingly small gesture: a hoped-for handshake.That hope has led to weeks of delicate diplomatic maneuverings, with small gestures parsed for deeper meaning. Japanese officials have begun expressing optimism that the meeting \u2014 the first since the men took power \u2014 would take place next month on the sidelines of a regional economic summit in Beijing.Among the promising signs cited by the Japanese side: a recent visit to Tokyo by the daughter of a former Chinese leader who not only met with Mr. Abe, but also sat with him to watch a performance by a visiting Chinese dance troupe.The final negotiations are still underway, so it is difficult to tell if the behind-the-scenes negotiations and emissaries shuttling between China and Japan are about to lead to a breakthrough as the Japanese officials suggest. But political analysts in Japan and abroad said both nations appeared to share a growing recognition that they had too much to lose, both economically and politically, if they did not find some way to get along. Both leaders have come under increasing pressure to contain the damage to their nations\u2019 large economic ties. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry has reported that Japanese direct investment in China dropped by nearly half in the first six months of this year from the year before. And sales of Japanese autos and other products in China are still down, although exports to China\u2019s coveted market have recovered somewhat after a steep drop in the first half of last year brought on by the island dispute. Experts say the two leaders are also loath to be seen as the bad guy in the region or in Washington as they battle each other for influence in Asia.With neither country willing to yield over the islands, some analysts now speak of a new status quo, in which China and Japan essentially agree to disagree while returning to business as usual in other areas.In that case, they said, the standoff could become a permanent feature of the security landscape, with both countries continuing to send ships there to make the point that they are in control, while also taking steps to prevent any escalation. \u201cJapan and China are seeking a new equilibrium,\u201d said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. \u201cThe best we can do now is to keep playing this game, but at a lower level, and to find ways to be less confrontational.\u201dOn Friday, China protested after Mr. Abe sent an offering of a potted plant to Yasukuni to mark an autumn festival, though Japanese officials had said they felt the offering would not affect the negotiations as Mr. Abe did not go in person. However, the biggest sticking point in the negotiations over a meet-and-greet has been how to handle the tense, two-year standoff over the disputed islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in China. The countries have been locked in an almost Cold War-style face-off since the purchase of the islands by Mr. Abe\u2019s predecessor in mid-2012, a move the government said was intended to prevent them from falling under the control of Japanese ultranationalists. Outraged by what it saw as a unilateral move to strengthen Japanese control over islands that it also claims, China began dispatching paramilitary ships to waters near the uninhabited islands and declared an air-defense zone above the islands, setting off an international uproar when it demanded all aircraft entering the area submit flight plans to Chinese authorities. For his part, Mr. Abe has refused to back down, expanding the flotilla of Japanese Coast Guard ships that chase the Chinese vessels in games of cat and mouse near the islands. Japan has also stepped up its patrols in China\u2019s newly claimed air-defense zone, a snub that provoked some close encounters between Japanese planes and Chinese fighter jets.China has been demanding that Japan recognize that the islands are in dispute, something that Japan has so far refused to do for fear of opening the door to further concessions.On Friday, the coveted handshake between Mr. Abe and Mr. Xi seemed to move a step closer to reality as Japan\u2019s Kyodo News agency reported Mr. Abe had shaken hands with China\u2019s No. 2 leader, Prime Minister Li Keqiang, at a dinner for Asian and European leaders in Milan. And last weekend, a top Japanese diplomat visited Beijing in what the Japanese news media said was a trip aimed at negotiating the handshake.The diplomatic efforts to bring together Mr. Abe and Mr. Xi began in July, when Yasuo Fukuda, a former Japanese prime minister, was allowed to meet Mr. Xi. Mr. Fukuda handed the Chinese leader a letter from Mr. Abe, and first proposed the meeting between the two leaders during the coming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.\u201cA month ago, I would have told you a meeting was not likely,\u201d said one high-level Japanese official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cNow, I\u2019d say both countries have come around to seeing it as in their interests.\u201dA Chinese analyst, Wu Xinbo, executive dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, was more equivocal: \u201cIf we see Abe is serious about improving relations with China and taking a more serious and responsible attitude towards the history issue, then that will lead to an improvement in bilateral relations.\u201d Bree Feng contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Still Pondering U.S.-Cuba Relations, Fidel Castro Responds", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverCuba\u2019s state-run newspaper, Granma, regularly publishes columns under the byline of the former president that tackle current events and seek to burnish the fading allure of the Cuban revolution that brought him to power in 1959.Hosts of state-run radio stations read Mr. Castro\u2019s column and discussed its content, which was a rare instance of the government\u2019s leaders allowing the state\u2019s tightly controlled media to discuss sensitive subjects, including political prisoners and the suspicious death of a political activist.It is unclear the extent to which Mr. Castro, who has been in failing health for years, still calls the shots in Cuba. There are hard-liners in the country who view rapprochement with the United States as a dangerous gamble that should be undertaken only gradually. But by presenting the argument to a wide audience, Mr. Castro seemed eager to telegraph the message that lower-level Cuban officials have been conveying to their American counterparts in recent years: let\u2019s talk.Mr. Castro excerpted without comment portions of the editorial that described the dismal state of the Cuban economy and the recent, halting economic reforms the government undertook to wean the nation from dependence on its troubled benefactor, Venezuela. Remarkably, Mr. Castro also included criticism of the Castro regime as an \u201cauthoritarian government\u201d that harasses and detains dissidents.Still, Mr. Castro seemed quite pleased to note that deeper engagement with the United States could unlock the potential of one of the hemisphere\u2019s most educated societies (using four exclamation marks). Cuba\u2019s state-run universities have produced one of the most literate societies in the region and the country routinely dispatches its doctors to assist in global crises. \u201cThis is indeed recognition,\u201d Mr. Castro said.Jaime Suchlicki, a Cuba expert at the University of Miami, said the column appeared to represent an effort by the government to show that it has become more open to criticism and introspection. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to show that they\u2019re more liberal,\u201d he said, arguing that the gesture should be seen with skepticism.Mr. Castro suggested that the United States could benefit from expanded cooperation with Cuba particularly in areas like climate change, commerce and arms control. He also made a reference to the global effort to prevent the Ebola virus from spreading further, in which Cuban doctors are playing a leading role.Leer en espa\u00f1ol \u00bbAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Smoke, No Mirrors: The Dutch Pension Plan ", "Date": "2014-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImagine a place where pensions were not an ever-deepening quagmire, where the numbers told the whole story and where workers could count on a decent retirement. Imagine a place where regulators existed to make sure everyone followed the rules.That place might just be the Netherlands. And it could provide an example for America\u2019s troubled cities, or for states like Illinois and New Jersey that have promised more in pension benefits than they can deliver.Going Dutch, however, can be painful. Dutch pensions are scrupulously funded, unlike many United States plans, and are required to tally their liabilities with brutal honesty, using a method that is common in the financial-services industry but rejected by American public pension funds. The Dutch system rests on the idea that each generation should pay its own costs \u2014 and that the costs must be measured accurately if that is to happen. After the financial collapse of 2008, workers and retirees in the Netherlands took the bitter medicine needed to rebuild their collective nest eggs quickly, with higher contributions from workers and benefit cuts for pensioners. The Dutch approach bears little resemblance to the American practice of shielding the current generation of workers, retirees and taxpayers while pushing costs and risks into the future, where they can metastasize unseen. The most recent data suggest that public funds in the United States are holding just 67 cents for every dollar they owe to current and future pensioners, and in some places the strain is palpable. The Netherlands, by contrast, have no Detroits (no cities going bankrupt because pension costs grew while the population shrank), no Puerto Ricos (territories awash in debt but with no access to bankruptcy court) and nothing like an Illinois or New Jersey, where elected officials kicked the can down the road so many times that it finally hit a dead end. Accomplishing this feat \u2014 solid workplace pensions for most citizens \u2014 isn\u2019t easy. For one thing, it\u2019s expensive. Dutch workers typically sock away nearly 18 percent of their pay, most of it in diversified, professionally run pension funds. That compares with 16.4 percent for American workers, but most of that is for Social Security, which is intended to provide just 40 percent of a middle-class worker\u2019s income in retirement. Dutch employers contribute to their system, too, but their payments are usually capped. While that may seem a counterintuitive way to make sure that pensions are well funded, it actually encourages companies to stick with pension plans. If the markets drop, Dutch employers do not receive urgent calls to pump in more money \u2014 the kind of cash calls that have prompted so many American companies to stop offering pensions. In the private sector, only 14 percent of Americans with retirement plans at work have defined-benefit pension plans \u2014 the ones that offer the most security \u2014 compared with 38 percent who had them in 1979. And if the markets rally and a Dutch pension fund earns more than it needs, the employers are not allowed to touch the surplus. In the United States, companies have found many ways to tap a pension surplus. The problem today is that there usually is no surplus left.Dutch companies, as well as public-sector employers, typically band together by sector in big, pooled pension plans, then hire nonprofit firms to invest the money. Terms are negotiated sectorwide in talks that resemble American-style collective bargaining. This vast collaborative process may sound too slow, too unwieldy and maybe even too socialist for American tastes. But standing guard over it is a decidedly capitalist watchdog, the Dutch central bank. More than a decade ago, after the dot-com collapse, a director of the central bank warned of a looming pension funding crisis. In response, the central bank in 2002 began to require pension funds to keep at least $1.05 on hand for every dollar they would have to pay in future benefits. If a fund fell below the line, it had just three years to recover. American public pension funds have no such minimum requirement, and even if they did, there is no regulator to enforce it. Company pensions are bound by federal funding rules, but Congress has a tendency to soften them. The Dutch central bank also imposed a rigorous method for measuring the current value of all pensions due in the future. Pensions are not supposed to be risky, so the Dutch measure them the same way the market prices very safe bonds, like Treasuries \u2014 that is, by discounting the future payments to today\u2019s dollars with a very low interest rate. This method shows that a stable lifelong benefit is very valuable, and therefore very expensive to fund. He explained that in the Netherlands, regulators believe that basing the cost of benefits today on possible investment gains tomorrow is the same as robbing tomorrow\u2019s workers to pay for today\u2019s excesses. Most public pension officials in the United States reject this view, saying governments can wait out bear markets because governments, unlike companies, don\u2019t go out of business. For years, economists have been calling on American cities and states to measure pensions the Dutch way. And, in fact, California\u2019s big state pension system, Calpers, sometimes calculates a city\u2019s total obligation by that method. When Stockton went bankrupt, for instance, Calpers recalculated and found that the city owed it $1.6 billion. Of course, Stockton is insolvent and does not have an extra $1.6 billion, but Christopher Klein, a bankruptcy judge, has said that federal bankruptcy law permits it to walk away from the debt. Calpers disagrees, setting up a clash that seems destined for the United States Supreme Court.But most of the time, when someone in the United States calls for Dutch-style measurements, pension officials suspect a ploy to show public pensions in the worst possible light, to make them easier to abolish. \u201cThey want to create a false report, to create a crisis,\u201d said Barry Kasinitz, director of government affairs for the International Association of Fire Fighters, after members of Congress introduced a bill to require the Dutch method. The Dutch say their approach is, in fact, supposed to prevent a crisis \u2014 the crisis that will ensue if the boomer generation retires without fully funded benefits. Their $1.05 minimum is really just a minimum; pension funds are encouraged to keep an even bigger surplus, to help them weather market shocks. The Dutch sailed into the global collapse of 2008 with $1.45 for every dollar of benefits owed, far more than they appeared to need. But when the dust settled, they were down to just 90 cents. The damage was so bad that the central bank gave them a breather: They had five years to get back to the $1.05 minimum, instead of the usual three. American public plans emerged from the crisis in worse shape, on the whole, and many allowed themselves 30 years to recover. But 30 years is so long that the boomer generation will have retired by then, and the losses will have been pushed far into the future for others to repay. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster if the employer happens to be a city like Detroit. The city\u2019s pension system used a 30-year schedule to cover losses but reset it at \u201cYear 1\u201d every year, a tactic employed in a surprising number of places. In Detroit, it meant the city never replaced the money that the pension system lost. When Detroit finally declared bankruptcy last year, an outside review found a $3.5 billion shortfall, one of the biggest claims of the bankruptcy. Manipulating the 30-year funding schedule had helped to hide it. \u201cThis happening in the Netherlands is totally out of the question,\u201d Mr. Kocken said.While the Netherlands has a stellar reputation for saving, that doesn\u2019t mean pensions have been without controversy there; in fact, a loud, intergenerational debate is occurring about how to manage pensions. The financial crisis raised new calls for reform, Mr. Ambachtsheer said. Retirees were shocked and angry to have their pensions cut by an average of 2 percent after the crash. That had never happened before, and many had no idea that cuts were even possible. A new political party, 50Plus, sprang up to defend the interests of older citizens and won two seats in the national Parliament. But something else happened: Dutch young people found their voice. No matter their employment sector, they could see that their pension money was commingled with retirees\u2019 money, then invested that way by the outside asset management firms. In the wake of the financial crisis, they realized that they and the retirees had fundamentally opposing interests. The young people were eager to keep taking investment risk, to take advantage of their long time horizon. But the retirees now wanted absolute safety, which meant investing in risk-free, cashlike assets. If all the money remained pooled, young people said, the aggressive investment returns they wanted would be diluted by the pittance that cashlike assets pay. \u201cNow the question is, \u2018How do you resolve this dilemma?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Ambachtsheer said. \u201cEverybody wants safety and everybody wants an affordable system, and you can\u2019t have both. It\u2019s become a major public debate in the Netherlands.\u201dIt\u2019s a debate that is rarely, if ever, heard in the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asia\u2019s American Angst", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 Outside China, there is a consistent theme in Asia. It is concern that declining American power, credibility and commitment will leave the way open for Beijing to exercise dominance over the region. President Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d has been dismissed as hot air. American objectives announced without consequence betray a weak presidency; Asians have drawn their conclusions.A new Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea and elsewhere is palpable. By contrast, the United States seems less focused on the region since former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton left office. That, at least, is the perception here in Singapore, one of the world\u2019s global cities and a small island-state whose extraordinary economic success is dependent on stability in Asia. That is inconceivable without America as counterbalance to China. But the feeling here, if anything, is that the Obama administration has pivoted away.Singapore, like much of Asia, is intrigued by the new all-change leadership of Narendra Modi in India. It is doubly intrigued because it sees in Modi the Lee Kuan Yew of India, a man with a near Singaporean commitment to modernity, efficiency and open trade. It is triply intrigued because it seeks a balance of power in Asia and the only possible long-term regional counterbalance to China is India.That scenario is, however, a distant one. In all aspects but its freedom, a not inconsequential matter, India lags China by a great distance. As Asia waits for the fruits of the magical Modi makeover, the presence of the United States as a Pacific power retains all its importance. India is inwardly focused. Its global reach is the last concern of the average Indian. A perception of American retreat from its ordering global role has led the smaller nations of Asia to feel more vulnerable to China\u2019s systematic push outward in search of resources and control.Singapore\u2019s success has depended on its ability to leapfrog geography, but it could only do that because the geography was not hostile. It could depend on the fact that the foreign territorial waters at its door remained open. Japan has been restrained from going nuclear by the assurance of America\u2019s treaty commitment to its defense. From north to south Asia, such assumptions appear a little shakier.Razeen Sally, a visiting associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, wrote this year in Singapore\u2019s Straits Times that: \u201cA global city is where truly global services cluster. Business \u2014 in finance, the professions, transport and communications \u2014 is done in several languages and currencies, and across several time zones and jurisdictions. Such creations face a unique set of challenges in the early 21st century. Today, there appear to be only five global cities. London and New York are at the top, followed by Hong Kong and Singapore, Asia\u2019s two service hubs. Dubai, the Middle East hub, is the newest and smallest kid on the block. Shanghai has global-city aspirations, but it is held back by China\u2019s economic restrictions \u2014 the vestiges of an ex-command economy \u2014 and its Leninist political system. Tokyo remains too Japan-centric, a far cry from a global city.\u201dNo global city can prosper in an environment where stability appears less certain and freedom in danger of curtailment. That is one reason why America\u2019s commitment to Asia matters as China rises \u2014 and doubts about America stir unease.It is not just that the Obama administration\u2019s commitment to concluding the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an ambitious free-trade agreement that would include Singapore, Vietnam and Japan among others, has appeared underwhelming. It is not merely that the United States, by some distance, is no longer the main trading partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as Asean. It is not simply that Chinese maritime bullying in an attempt to assert its right to natural resources in the South China Sea has proceeded unabated.It is not just that Obama, during his last visit to Asia, gave a very evasive answer to a question about whether by saying the United States would protect the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands (claimed by China) he risked drawing another \u201cred line.\u201d The president said he thought the implication of the question was \u201cthat each and every time a country violates one of those norms the United States should go to war, or stand prepared to engage militarily, and if it doesn\u2019t then somehow we\u2019re not serious about those norms. Well, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Try cashing that one at the bank.It is all of these things, plus an uneasy general feeling. The \u201cpivot to Asia,\u201d like the Syrian \u201cred line,\u201d like \u201cAssad must go,\u201d betrayed a common theme: words without meaning from an American president, commitments without follow-up, phrases without plans. In Asia as in Europe, these things get noted.The American idea is still strong in Asia. Look no further than the brave pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. But ideas require commitment to back them. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Businesses Turn to Airbnb", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesLauren Hauber has moved past the days of trudging down the hotel corridor with an ice bucket.Like a growing number of business travelers, Ms. Hauber, a San Francisco resident, and her co-workers have started staying in apartments and houses managed through Airbnb, which in July started a site aimed at attracting more business travelers. The service allows travelers \u2014 business and leisure \u2014 to rent space for short periods.\u201cI really like having a kitchen,\u201d said Ms. Hauber, who does business development for Wildlife Works, an environmental firm in Mill Valley, Calif. \u201cA lot of times they\u2019ll have washers and dryers. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m losing anything by using an Airbnb.\u201dCompanies large and small, increasingly focused on budgets, are starting to look beyond hotels to apartments and houses.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing really kind of shocking growth in the use of Airbnb by business travelers,\u201d said Tim MacDonald, an executive vice president with Concur, which designs software for managing business expenses and travel. Use of Airbnb properties by companies using the Concur system has surged in the past year, Mr. MacDonald said. San Francisco, New York and Austin, as well as Paris and London, have been particularly popular destinations for business travelers opting for Airbnb, he said.The service has been embraced especially in San Francisco, where hotel occupancy rates hover around 90 percent, said Joe D\u2019Alessandro, president and chief executive of the San Francisco Travel Association.During technology conferences like Oracle OpenWorld and Macworld, \u201cthe city\u2019s basically in sellout mode,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alessandro said. Before Airbnb, he added, \u201cthere were times when the city was full and people just couldn\u2019t get in.\u201dThe trend is part of a growing reliance on the so-called sharing economy, which also includes companies like the Uber car service and TaskRabbit, where clients can find people to help with everyday chores and other tasks. The service has proved popular with property owners, he said, especially since business travel helps fill vacant sites during the week. \u201cTypically business travelers are good travelers,\u201d he said. \u201cHosts enjoy having them.\u201dAmong the hosts who have benefited is Steve Puryear, who said up to two-thirds of the guests in his Austin condominium \u2014 including Ms. Hauber and her colleagues \u2014 were business travelers. The headline on his Airbnb listing makes his preference clear: \u201cPerfect 4 Executives/Professionals.\u201d\u201cI was getting a lot of bachelor parties and stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to steer toward business travelers. There are long-term residents in the building and noise complaints are expensive.\u201dAirbnb\u2019s primary competitor, HomeAway, has not focused on business travel and has no plans to do so, said Jon Gray, its senior vice president for the Americas. Business trips account for 2 percent of the company\u2019s bookings, he said.HomeAway, which runs VRBO and VacationRentals.com, among other sites, is looking at a new site focusing on homes in urban areas, however, Mr. Gray said. Increased business travel may \u201ccome along for the ride,\u201d he said.Increased competition from Airbnb and others will force hotels to find ways to bring back business travelers, said Michael W. McCormick, executive director and chief operating officer of the Global Business Travel Association. For now, he said, it is no wonder that companies are using the new service.\u201cTravelers and companies are always looking for creative options,\u201d Mr. McCormick said. \u201cFrom that perspective, everybody\u2019s intrigued.\u201dBut businesses have started to embrace Airbnb in the meantime. The service has come in handy for GitHub, a San Francisco-based software start-up with about 150 employees who work outside the Bay Area. Without Airbnb, many of those employees would have trouble finding hotel rooms during conferences, said Brian Doll, a GitHub vice president.\u201cAll the hotels are pretty much booked,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything that\u2019s left is going to be six times the market rate.\u201dAirbnb properties, which often include common areas like family or dining rooms, also give employees more working space than a hotel room, Mr. Doll said. \u201cWe might have four to six people traveling to a location to do work together,\u201d he said. \u201cHotel rooms aren\u2019t well suited for that.\u201dThe business travel market is still big enough for both hotels and Airbnb, said Mr. McCormick of the Global Business Travel Association. Many travelers will opt for the convenience of room service over the freedom of a kitchen, he said.\u201cYes, they are all competing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think Airbnb is bringing something different to a different segment of the marketplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate, Conflict and a Pentagon Report", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:A recently released Pentagon report asserts a causal relationship between climate and terrorism. The research community, however, is far from reaching a consensus on how climate interacts with other factors to bring about or worsen conflict.Recent studies suggest that conflicts associated with climate change\u00a0manifest as intercommunal and local conflicts, and often occur in countries that suffer from weak environmental protection frameworks, high socioeconomic and political inequality, and poor recognition of water and land rights.\u00a0Such conflicts cannot be mitigated through the financing of foreign counterterrorism units, which can further sour relationships between governments or jeopardize state legitimacy. Moreover, threats to human security from climate change should not provide the rationale for expanding the Pentagon\u2019s budget or have it subsume the role of civilian agencies.Instead, we need investment in civil society mediation, resilient resource governance structures at local and national levels, and support for local institutions that are best positioned to mediate political conflict over climate-affected resources and facilitate adaptation to a more hostile climate.To the Editor:The recognition of the effects of extreme drought on the conflict in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, shows that global warming is already affecting us directly, and the threat will increase as our use of fossil fuels continues. The Pentagon report should be a game-changer for America\u2019s response to the United Nations agreement on this global problem.\u00a0The agreement, to be signed in Paris in 2015, will determine how the world responds to this threat. Will we simply follow other countries\u2019 lead, or will we lead with a proposal that builds on our strengths?\u00a0A revenue-neutral carbon tax, with proceeds returned to households, would stimulate local economies while spurring new investments toward a new energy future.\u00a0If Congress acts now to enact such a tax, America could set the standard for other countries to follow, one that allows the free market to choose the most efficient means of combating the climate crisis.

{"Headline": "Some Hong Kong Residents, Weary of Disruptions, Find Fault With Protesters\u2019 Methods", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The pro-democracy demonstrators are young and passionate and, with their so-called Umbrella Revolution, have captured people\u2019s imaginations here and abroad.But as the shutdown of large areas of this financial capital of 7.2 million drags on with no obvious political solution in sight, some Hong Kong residents are voicing skepticism over the demonstrators\u2019 goals and strategies as well as anxiety over emerging divisions in society.\u201cWhat I feel very concerned about and very sad about is that the polarization is very acute,\u201d said Lau Nai-keung, a businessman who helped draft the Basic Law, the mini-constitution used to govern Hong Kong since its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. \u201cFather and son can\u2019t talk to each other. Husband and wife quarrel, and so on. It\u2019s becoming very common nowadays.\u201d\u201cI think whatever happens,\u201d he said, \u201cthe wound will take more than a decade to heal.\u201dLooming over the political showdown is the question of how much popular support the protesters have, and under what conditions that support might wane. In recent days, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets and helped shut down four major areas of the city. Though many of those who began this round of protests were students, the movement won sympathy from a wide cross-section of society after the police opened fire with tear gas and pepper spray.Still, the numbers are less than those of other street rallies and marches in Hong Kong, including ones against proposed Chinese Communist Party policies that have drawn hundreds of thousands of people. And critics like Mr. Lau contend that popular support of the current movement is much less than what the protesters claim. For instance, many among the business elite privately denounce the protests and one commerce association has discussed filing a lawsuit against protest organizers for financial loss. And few middle-age and elderly people are now attending the nighttime rallies.Some skeptics, like Joe Leung, 58, complained about the inconveniences being caused by the protests, especially the traffic as protesters camped out on major boulevards. \u201cI want them to protest at Victoria Park or Tamar Park,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t disrupt our lives.\u201dWhat is more troubling, the critics say, is that the protesters, led by students and by organizers of a movement called Occupy Central With Love and Peace, are trying to confront one of the world\u2019s most powerful political entities \u2014 the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party \u2014 with no coherent strategy for achieving their stated goal of universal suffrage for Hong Kong by 2017.Without reliable polling data this week, it is difficult to tell how many people disapprove of the protesters and to pinpoint demographic patterns among the movement\u2019s supporters and its detractors. Surveys have shown for years that three-fifths or more of the Hong Kong population favors democracy. But some democracy supporters have long been wary of confrontational tactics.Michael DeGolyer, a longtime pollster at Hong Kong Baptist University, said that academic polling done before the start of the demonstrations provided strong hints of the levels \u2014 and limits \u2014 of support for Occupy Central and other groups now protesting.Surveys indicated that if the pro-democracy camp split and only radicals participated in the demonstrations, then around 20 percent of the population would support them, Mr. DeGolyer said. If moderate democrats backed the protests as well, as has occurred, then support for the demonstrators would be around 35 percent. And 45 percent to 50 percent of the population would back the democrats if they stayed united and if the Beijing and Hong Kong governments reacted harshly to them \u2014 as happened with the violent police confrontations on Sunday.But while a significant portion of the Hong Kong population may have rallied to the side of the protesters early this week, maintaining that support may be difficult, Mr. DeGolyer warned, especially if China takes punitive measures that could hurt the economy, like restricting the number of mainland tourists coming here.At a news conference on Thursday, Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who is chairwoman of the New People\u2019s Party, said the protests had already damaged the tourism, restaurant and retail industries. \u201cI think very severe damage is being done not just to the tycoons, but also to the ordinary people in the streets,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many popular tourist areas are being shut down \u2014 Canton Road, Causeway Bay. Clearly a lot of economic damage is being inflicted, and also very severe damage to our image overseas.\u201dFor nine days, waves of pro-democracy protests engulfed Hong Kong, swelling at times to tens of thousands of people and raising tensions with Beijing.In the streets, there have been occasional confrontations between protesters and their opponents. On Wednesday, at the protest site on Canton Road, a few critics of the pro-democracy crowd shouted at them from a sidewalk. Some protesters stood up to respond, and heated shouting matches unfolded. But the protesters quickly changed their approach, waving to the critics and shouting, \u201cBye bye.\u201d The tension faded.The protesters have two main demands: that Beijing remove Mr. Leung as chief executive, and that it renounce a decision made in August by the Chinese National People\u2019s Congress to limit the nomination process for chief executive candidates in 2017 to selection by a 1,200-person committee that would mostly be aligned with Beijing\u2019s interests.In Hong Kong, those sentiments are being echoed in some quarters.\u201cThey\u2019re living in their own dreams, totally detached from the reality,\u201d said Mr. Lau, the businessman who helped draft the Basic Law. \u201cTheir demands, their objectives, are totally ludicrous.\u201dWhat the protest organizers ultimately want, he said, is \u201ca replay of June 4\u201d \u2014 the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 in which hundreds and possibly thousands of pro-democracy advocates were killed by the Chinese Army, resulting in worldwide condemnation of China.Alan Wong, Keith Bradsher and Austin Ramzy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once a Draw, Restive Region in China Suffers After Unrest", "Date": "2014-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKANAS LAKE, China \u2014 The two amateur photographers stood on a hill overlooking the sparkling river in this remote alpine park, waiting for nomads to emerge from their white yurts and herd cows across a bridge.The men, both age 60, were driving on a one-month road trip through the western region of Xinjiang to capture scenes like this one.\u201cDon\u2019t listen to what other people say about Xinjiang and don\u2019t believe what you read,\u201d said Sun Jingchuan, a retired aircraft maintenance worker from Sichuan Province in southwest China. \u201cIt\u2019s very safe here.\u201dXinjiang, the size of Western Europe, has long been considered one of China\u2019s most exotic destinations. Chinese tourists, usually traveling in tour groups, visit the grasslands and Siberian forests here in the north and desert oasis towns in the south, along the old Silk Road.Among the locals, an estimated 1.5 million people have some tie to Xinjiang\u2019s tourism economy, and many were hoping for a big surge in visitor numbers during the National Day holiday week in China, which began Wednesday. But given reports in late September of dozens killed in clashes, there is little expectation that the numbers will match those of previous years.In the first half of this year, visits from domestic tourists dropped 7 percent, to 20 million, compared to the same period last year, according to official statistics. The revenue from domestic tourists fell nearly 6 percent, to $3.5 billion.Foreign tourism, which is a fraction of the total, also dropped, by nearly 1 percent, to 619,300, with revenue falling 1 percent, to $161 million. The Xinjiang Regional Tourism Bureau blames \u201cinfluences from recent terrorist attacks\u201d for the downturn.On online travel forums, the question \u201cIs it safe to travel in Xinjiang?\u201d is common. On one forum, people wrote that it was better to go to northern Xinjiang, where there are fewer Uighurs, a minority ethnic group whose clashes with the Han majority account for much of the violence, and more Kazakhs, Mongolians and other ethnic minorities. Violence in Urumqi, the regional capital, and in the south has been greater. So desperate are Xinjiang officials to draw tourists that they issued $3.2 million worth of \u201ctravel cards\u201d from January to April to tourists visiting with tour groups. The cards, worth $80 each, could be used to pay for hotels, attractions and local products.Many Han have long held negative stereotypes of Uighurs, as petty thieves, for example, but attitudes hardened after rioting in 2009 in Urumqi resulted in at least 200 deaths, most of them Han. Uighurs say much of their anger grows from long-running discrimination by the Han. The government blames Uighur separatists for most of the attacks.Even in northern Xinjiang, far from the Uighur heartland, tourism workers say business is suffering. \u201cThis year has been slow,\u201d said Chen Yan, 37, a masseuse from Sichuan who works every summer at a hotel in Burqin, a mostly Kazakh town that is the gateway to Kanas Lake.Ms. Chen said she had made about $650 a month this season, compared with about $1,000 a month last summer, earnings that help support a 14-year-old son and a husband who does odd jobs, both in Sichuan.A Kazakh driver in the town, Sailin, said, \u201cEach year, business gets worse.\u201dAs Kanas Lake has become more popular with tourists in recent years \u2014 in part because of the legend of a Lochness-style monster that lurks in the waters \u2014 hotel construction has boomed in the park and on its periphery. But managers say occupancy rates are low this year. At the lake, dozens of visitors boarded white speedboats one afternoon for a tour. But in past years, there were many more people, said Sultanate, a Kazakh man who worked at the park entrance. \u201cThe captain of one of the boats spends all day wiping the windows,\u201d he said.But overall numbers are up this year compared to last, reflecting an increase in visitors from Xinjiang, possibly because more are choosing to visit the north since it has fewer Uighurs.On a bus ride, a 30-year-old woman from Zhejiang Province who was traveling with friends for three months across Xinjiang, Tibet and Nepal said the park was beautiful, but other parts of Xinjiang held less appeal. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Kashgar is too dangerous,\u201d she said, referring to the fabled Uighur caravan town in the south that has been a site of attacks.Mr. Sun, the photographer in the Kanas Lake area, said only a handful of Uighurs were to blame. \u201cIn southern Xinjiang, a few violent individuals were able to coerce others into taking part in violence,\u201d he said. \u201cOne person would come to your home and say, \u2018You\u2019re a Uighur \u2014 do this or I\u2019ll put a knife to the throat of your mother or sister.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHe had waited for the morning to get the shot of cows crossing the bridge, but they had not budged from their pasture.

{"Headline": "Bosnian Elections Reinforce Longstanding Ethnic Divisions", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The stranglehold of parties representing narrow ethnic interests in Bosnia and Herzegovina was set to continue after elections over the weekend, analysts said Tuesday, reinforcing long-simmering divisions in the country and slowing its progress nearly 20 years after a brutal war.The war ended with the Dayton peace accords of 1995, which the United States helped broker. But the pact divided Bosnia into a Muslim-Croat Federation and a Serbian Republic, entrenching a decentralized political system that has helped reinforce ethnic tensions. Today, Bosnia is grappling with political paralysis, a faltering economy, and the lack of political will necessary to make the political and economic changes required to join the European Union.With most of the votes counted from the elections held Sunday for national and regional assemblies, parties with deeply divergent views of the country\u2019s future appeared set to continue to hold sway.With 85 percent of ballots counted, Milorad Dodik, a Bosnian Serb nationalist who advocates secession from Bosnia, led the race for president of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia. Mr. Dodik, who has the backing of the Kremlin, has faced criticism from Western officials for effectively promoting the disintegration of Bosnia and for forging closer ties with Moscow.The divisions hampering the country were also on display in parliamentary and regional elections: Bosnian Serb leaders pushed for independence, Bosnian Croat leaders pressed for more autonomy and Bosnian Muslim leaders favored more centralized power.Srecko Latal, an analyst with Social Overview Service, a research organization in Sarajevo, said elections had entrenched longstanding nationalist divisions, leaving Bosnia \u201cstuck\u201d with its byzantine institutional structures and a weak economy. He said the situation was exacerbated by the fact that other countries, distracted by crises in the Middle East and elsewhere, had stopped applying concerted pressure for change in Bosnia.\u201cAll three sides for the past 20 years have been unable to reach any compromise, so the country is paralyzed,\u201d Mr. Latal said. \u201cThey can\u2019t agree on the past and they can\u2019t agree on the present \u2014 never mind the future.\u201dBosnia, one of Europe\u2019s poorest countries, has been struggling with an ailing economy and an unemployment rate of roughly 44 percent. The country was hit by devastating floods in May that damaged its already creaky infrastructure and caused roughly $2.5 billion in damage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In This Election, Obama\u2019s Party Benches Him", "Date": "2014-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 When he soared to victory by almost 10 million votes in 2008, President Obama won in states like Virginia that Democratic candidates had not captured since 1964. He was trumpeted as a transformational leader who remade American politics by creating a new electoral map and a diverse voter coalition to shape the Democratic Party for the 21st century.But for now he has been reduced to something else: an isolated political figure who is viewed as a liability to Democrats in the very states where voters by the thousands had once stood to cheer him. When Mr. Obama entered the campaign fray last week, he did so by returning to the unconditional embrace of his own hometown, in a blue state where the incumbent Democratic senator faces scant opposition and the Democratic governor is running in part on his support for the Affordable Care Act. On Tuesday, the president attended private fund-raisers in Manhattan, to be followed by similar events in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Arkansas it is not.As November nears, Mr. Obama and his loyalists are being forced to reconcile that it is not only Democrats in conservative-leaning states, like Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who are avoiding him. The president who became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to twice win a majority of the vote is flying in politically restricted airspace. Democratic senators in Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia \u2014 states that were pivotal to his success and whose demographics reflect his winning coalition of young, minority and female voters \u2014 do not want him. Nor does his party\u2019s Senate nominee in Iowa, where Mr. Obama won twice and whose youth-filled 2008 Democratic caucuses vaulted him toward the nomination.Some leading Democrats say it would be better for him to make the case for the party\u2019s economic policies safely away from the most crucial races \u2014 as he did last week in Illinois.\u201cIt\u2019s not so important where he says it \u2014 it\u2019s what he says,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.Yet even the slightest injection of the Obama brand into this election seems perilous for Democrats.Last week, speaking at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., Mr. Obama declared that while he was not up for re-election, his \u201cpolicies are on the ballot.\u201d Immediately, Republicans pounced, putting the clip in videos to link their rivals to the president. Democrats winced, and David Axelrod, the longtime Obama adviser, acknowledged Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the remark was \u201ca mistake.\u201dA succession of domestic and foreign crises, along with some self-inflicted wounds, has badly tarnished Mr. Obama. And that is on top of the history of the president\u2019s party doing poorly in midterm elections.But Mr. Obama is no ordinary president in the eyes of his supporters, who believe he has permanently reshaped the makeup of his party and the way Democrats ought to go about winning elections. And his diminished role in this year\u2019s campaign has set off the first stirrings of a debate sure to grow louder if Democrats lose the Senate next month.\u201cEvery campaign has got to figure out \u2014 and this is true in this election, and it\u2019s going to be true for every election going forward for Democrats for as far as the eye can see \u2014 is which Democrats are only going to be able to win if they turn out enough of the Obama coalition, whether we\u2019re in a midterm or a presidential,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to the president who has been with him since his 2008 campaign. \u201cAnd the campaigns and the candidates are working through how best to go about doing that.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s aides say they understand that candidates will make their own decisions as it relates to using the president. But a central tenet of Mr. Obama\u2019s formula for success is that Democrats win by motivating core voters to turn out as much as they do by persuading swing voters \u2014 and that nobody can rouse the base like Mr. Obama. So for candidates to distance themselves from the president, or even disparage him, is to ignore a potential path to victory.But other Democrats contend that Mr. Obama is a drag on his party. Even among young voters and women, two of Mr. Obama\u2019s core constituencies, the president has lost popularity.\u201cWe have built on the targeting and turnout operations that the Obama campaign developed and are involving the president to engage voters in the most efficient ways,\u201d said Matt Canter, a senior official at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Mr. Obama is taping recordings that will be used for get-out-the-vote phone calls, radio ads and videos. But that such targeted efforts \u2014 \u201cefficient ways,\u201d as Mr. Canter put it \u2014 are being used, rather than deploying the president to swing states, speaks to his weak standing. Democrats beyond Mr. Obama\u2019s orbit also dispute the idea that the president has a special hold on the rising demographic that has given the party a formidable electoral coalition.\u201cWe began building a Democratic coalition well before this president, and it\u2019s going to be strong well after this president,\u201d said Rick Palacio, chairman of the Colorado Democratic Party, noting that candidates there tapped into the state\u2019s changing demographics to win in 2004.For Senator Mark Udall to win, the first-term Colorado Democrat must show that he stands for \u201cthe Colorado way, not the Obama way or the Democratic way,\u201d said Ken Salazar, a former senator from Colorado who served as Interior secretary during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term.Asked if he would have invited Mr. Obama to the state if he were running this year, Mr. Salazar paused, chuckled and said: \u201cPresident Obama is a good friend of mine, and he would always be welcome in my home. But I\u2019m not running for political office and am not going to answer your hypothetical.\u201dWhile his campaign schedule is fluid, the president intends to spend the rest of the month focusing in public on economic growth and in private on raising money for his party. Aides say that Mr. Obama plans to give a series of speeches focusing on different sectors of the economy, along with events dedicated to economic issues concerning women and young voters, as well as ways to bolster the clean energy economy. Aides previewed that plan last month to Democratic senators who urged a tight focus on pocketbook issues.\u201cI said people are worried about Ebola and ISIS, but what they have to live day to day is making ends meet,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important he not just talk about what he has accomplished, but what he wants to do in the future.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s loyalists say they, too, are eager to return to domestic issues. \u201cWhen people are jumping a fence at the White House and Ebola is in Dallas it\u2019s hard to get a message through,\u201d said Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama\u2019s former press secretary.Where exactly Mr. Obama ought to be delivering his campaign message, though, is still debated in Democratic circles.Representative Steve Israel, the New York Democrat who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, suggested he would like Mr. Obama to visit three solidly blue states that are home to competitive House contests. \u201cIn California, Illinois and New York, the president is very helpful,\u201d he said.But Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois, a Democrat running for re-election who is hoping to get Mr. Obama back to Chicago for a rally, said his counterparts risked turning off Democratic voters by spurning the president. \u201cI think they\u2019re making a big mistake,\u201d he said.But Democrats no longer on the ballot believe the president should focus his time on his most loyal constituency.\u201cI\u2019d have Obama on an evangelistic schedule of black churches all over the country,\u201d said Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco. \u201cI think he really should go to the black base. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other place I would trust he wouldn\u2019t create an adverse reaction rather than a positive reaction.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Companies Turn to Chinese Investors", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal TrendsFRANKFURT \u2014 Equipment made by Putzmeister has been used to help smother out-of-control nuclear reactors in Chernobyl and Fukushima, but the German company had no technology to protect it when the global economic meltdown struck in 2008.Putzmeister, based in the town of Aichtal, south of Stuttgart, suffered more than a 50 percent plunge in revenue and had to cut its German staff of about 2,500 by roughly half. Then, a rescuer came from an unlikely place: China.In a deal that has become emblematic of Europe\u2019s increasing openness to Chinese investors, Sany Group, a maker of construction equipment based in Changsha in Hunan Province, bought Putzmeister in 2012.The apparent success of the combined company since then is one reason why Premier Li Keqiang of China received a warm welcome when he visited Berlin and Hamburg this month. Despite some remaining friction, Germany and Europe in general have largely overcome fears that Chinese investors would steal technology, close costly European factories and ship the production to China.\u201cWith the difficult situation in the world economy that we see at the moment, it\u2019s a sign of stability that economic cooperation between Germany and China is developing very well,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said on Oct. 10 after announcing a host of new treaties and business contracts between the two nations, including orders for Airbus planes and an extension of Volkswagen\u2019s joint venture in China with the FAW Group Corporation until 2041.One reason that Europeans have become more welcoming of the Chinese is that they need the help. Economic growth is weak, the population is aging, and business investment is tepid. Besides money, Chinese investors help European companies get better access to China and other Asian markets.Partly as a result, Europe has surpassed the United States as China\u2019s largest trading partner, and Europeans appear to be eager for more. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say Europe is welcoming Chinese investment,\u201d said Jeremy Clegg, a professor at Leeds University Business School in Britain who has studied the subject.Another reason the Chinese are welcome is that, at least so far, they have proved to be unobtrusive, almost invisible, managers. At Putzmeister\u2019s main plant in Aichtal, there is just one Chinese executive and five Chinese trainees, said Uwe Misselbeck, the company\u2019s head of human resources.\u201cWe\u2019re still eating with knives and forks,\u201d Mr. Misselbeck said last month at an event in Frankfurt organized by consulting firm KPMG before Mr. Li\u2019s visit. The session was part of a campaign to counter lingering stereotypes about Chinese owners.Putzmeister specializes in equipment to pump concrete at construction sites, which was used to contain nuclear radiation at Chernobyl in 1986, in what is now Ukraine, and to pump massive amounts of water to cool the malfunctioning reactor at Fukushima, Japan, in 2011.\u201cThe Chinese colleagues treated us very cordially,\u201d Mr. Misselbeck said of the takeover by Sany. He compared them favorably with investors from the United States, \u201cwho want to tell you how the world works.\u201dThe United States remains by far the largest source of direct investment in Europe, accounting for more than one third of the total in 2012, the most recent year for which complete information is available. That compared to a 2.6 percent share for China.But investment from China has grown at a much faster rate than that from any other country. The value of Chinese holdings in the European Union more than quadrupled from 2010 to 2012, to 26.8 billion euros, or $34 billion at current exchange rates, according to Eurostat, the official statistics agency.Chinese companies have invested in ports in Genoa and Naples in Italy and in Athens. They have bought Italian makers of steel products, German manufacturers of patio furniture, and Hungarian chemical producers. Hamburg, which hosted Mr. Li on Oct. 11 at a \u201cChina Meets Europe\u201d meeting, has more than 500 Chinese companies in the city and surrounding area, according to the local chamber of commerce.And investment from China could get a further boost as the Chinese government streamlines the approval process that domestic companies must go through before they invest abroad, according to KPMG.Chinese investors have also drawn attention with a number of high-profile deals and their willingness to buy troubled companies. One of the most attention-getting acquisitions was in 2010 when Zhejiang Geely Holding bought Volvo Cars from Ford Motor.In August, when Volvo unveiled its first completely new model under Chinese ownership at an event in Stockholm, the Chinese presence was so discreet it was invisible. No Chinese executives appeared. Volvo executives presented the new car, a sport utility vehicle called the XC90, as the embodiment of Swedish aesthetics and engineering.Hakan Samuelsson, the chief executive of Volvo Cars, implied that the company had more freedom under Geely\u2019s ownership than under Ford.\u201cThey have given us a new role as a stand-alone company,\u201d Mr. Samuelsson said of Geely during a meeting with a small group of journalists. \u201cWe are not a sort of division executing commands from some center.\u201dIn an example of how Chinese ownership can open up new markets for European companies, China has become the largest market for Volvo Cars. The top-of-the-line XC90 will be built in Sweden, but other Volvo models are already being manufactured in China and the company is considering exporting some of the Chinese-made models to the United States.The Chinese-European trade relationship is not without tensions. European investors complain that they face far more restrictions investing in China than vice versa, as well as a disadvantage competing against Chinese companies that are government owned or receive government subsidies.European officials have accused China of imposing restrictions on the export of raw materials in violation of rules pertaining to members of the World Trade Organization. They have also accused China of selling solar panels at dumping prices, a practice that has created severe problems for German producers of solar equipment.When Mr. Li visited Berlin on Oct. 10, against a background of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Ms. Merkel was careful to mention that they had also discussed human rights issues.Chinese officials have also made accusations against European companies. In September, price regulators in Hubei Province imposed a fine of $40.5 million on the Audi unit of Volkswagen, saying that the automaker had reached monopolistic agreements with 10 dealerships to maintain high prices for cars and replacement parts.Progress has been slow on an effort to negotiate a new comprehensive investment agreement between the European Union and China that would ease some of these frictions, while simplifying transactions and providing more protections to investors. State-owned Chinese companies are the largest investors in Europe in monetary terms, and even private companies like Sany have close ties to the government. That leads to persistent suspicion that Chinese investment is part of a stealth effort to exert influence in the European economy.But at the local level the light touch applied by Chinese managers seems to have helped assuage such concerns.Mr. Clegg, the University of Leeds professor, said the restraint displayed by Chinese owners reflected their own relative newness to international business. That sets them apart from, say, American investors who may make acquisitions specifically because they think they can improve the way a company is managed.\u201cUnlike the American model, the firms from China are not going abroad with managerial talent, with decades of experience,\u201d Mr. Clegg said. \u201cThey would still say they have more to learn.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Warns of Global Financial Risk From Fiscal Policies", "Date": "2014-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As global leaders sounded the alarm about a slowing world economy, a more immediate concern drew the attention of policy makers at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s semiannual meetings last week: inflated asset prices and increasing levels of debt overseas.Bond markets in the eurozone are booming, debt in China is at historic highs and the United States stock market, even with its sharp fall last week, has been on a tear.As economists and politicians heap pressure on global central banks to continue, and even escalate, their unusually loose monetary policies in order to spur global demand, the fear that these measures could provoke another market convulsion is spreading.\u201cA major lesson of the last crisis is that accommodative monetary policy contributed to financial excesses,\u201d said Lucas Papademos, a former vice president of the European Central Bank. \u201cWe are pursuing a similar policy for good reason. But there are limits \u2014 if you do this for too long, risks in the financial markets will materialize.\u201dOver the last week this debate has been playing out here: on panels at think tanks, in huddles inside and outside the hulking I.M.F. building and in formal talks between government officials and central bankers.Mario Draghi, the president of the E.C.B., echoed these concerns on Saturday when he said that beyond concerns about the global economy, one of the main topics of discussion was \u201cincreasing financial risk-taking\u201d by investors, especially nonbank institutions.To a degree, the fund\u2019s warning that the eurozone\u2019s economy, and Germany\u2019s in particular, might face a recession turned what had been an academic discussion into a major political issue.The outcry for Germany, which has surpassed China as the country with the largest trade surplus in the world, to spend more on infrastructure to revitalize its flagging economy was loud enough. But behind closed doors there was an even harder push for more immediate action: a purchase by the European Central Bank of Italian, Spanish and Greek government bonds, in large quantities.While the bank has presented a plan to buy securitized corporate bonds, many now think that too few of these securities exist for the plan to make a difference.Germany, led by its hawkish central bank head, Jens Weidmann, has resisted all moves by the E.C.B. to buy government bonds in bulk.One senior E.C.B. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that within the body\u2019s governing council, Germany is facing increased pressure to relax its opposition to such measures, especially as worries about growth and deflation increase.\u201cI think you will see this happen in less than a year,\u201d the person said.Such a step, of course, would create even more of a global buying frenzy for eurozone government bonds, and earlier in the week Christine Lagarde, the chief of the I.M.F., warned that the strong performance of these instruments was not supported by the underlying economies in their countries.In effect, bond market investors are stomping on the gas pedal while banks, burdened by persistent regulatory demands, still have their foot on the brake.\u201cHow am I supposed to lend any money if I have to go through a stress test every six months?\u201d said the chairman of a large European bank who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to offend his new regulator, the E.C.B.Last week, the I.M.F. said that in Europe, 70 percent of the large banks it monitored were not in a position to support an economic recovery via increased lending.\u201cWhat we see is extraordinary risk-taking in the financial markets while in the real economy risk-taking has taken a holiday,\u201d said Claudio Borio, a senior economist at the Bank for International Settlements, a clearinghouse for global central banks.For some time, the bank has said that central banks need to be more aware of asset bubbles and curb their actions accordingly.Mr. Borio was on a panel that examined what monetary policy can do to address strains in the economy. His remarks drew a sharp rebuke from V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, the second most senior executive at the E.C.B.\u201cWe cannot create minirecessions at the first sign of financial instability,\u201d Mr. Const\u00e2ncio said, arguing that regulators in different countries needed to address these issues by imposing restrictions on the investment firms that engaged in these activities. Mr. Draghi, at his news conference, said he did not see signs of a government-bond bubble in the eurozone, although he did say the matter demanded close attention.In particular, bankers and debt experts pointed to the huge buildup in corporate and private-sector debt in emerging markets resulting from the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond-buying program.\u201cOverall debt has continued to grow quite dramatically \u2014 China\u2019s has grown by $15 trillion in the past six years,\u201d said Susan Lund, an analyst at McKinsey, the consulting firm. \u201cThat is a very large number.\u201dThe pace of this buildup has increased over recent years, and regulators worry that when United States interest rates rise, investors \u2014 especially on the retail side \u2014 will pull their money out.At that point, experts believe, the funds would have a hard time selling those securities, which tend to not attract large numbers of buyers and sellers.\u201cWe do worry that if a lot of this money heads for the exit at the same time you could see a major fire sale,\u201d said Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank of England.For some observers, though, the debate about asset bubbles and what central banks should do about them misses a crucial point. An increase in interest rates by the Fed, assuming it happened because the American economy was in full recovery mode, would be a positive sign, they say \u2014 not just for the United States but also for global financial markets in general.\u201cInterest rates are going to go up in 2015 \u2014 why are the markets getting all whipsawed?\u201d said James P. Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, speaking at a luncheon conference on Friday. \u201cRates are going up because the U.S. economy is doing better \u2014 and that is a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Soak the Rich", "Date": "2014-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLOS ANGELES \u2014 IN response to the growing income disparity between the wealthy and the merely well off \u2014 not to mention the middle class and working class \u2014 an increasing number of economists and politicians have called for higher tax rates on top incomes. That would collect more revenues, and make our tax system more progressive, by collecting a disproportionate share of those new revenues from the highest income taxpayers, a fact that appeals to many people\u2019s sense of fairness. But even taking into account regressive state and local taxes, the American tax system already is the most progressive in the developed world. And the scars left by the 2013 fight over the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d tax deal imply that trying to raise top marginal income tax rates to the levels suggested by some academics would be, well, a wholly academic exercise. That does not mean, however, that we are bereft of instruments to tackle income inequality. In fact, achieving equality through the tax structure is the wrong way to think about the issue. Reformers have blundered by confusing what seems fair \u2014 more progressive taxation \u2014 with what is actually important, and lacking: a progressive fiscal system. As other developed countries have figured out, reducing inequality is not about where the money comes from, but where the money goes, and how much of it is spent.A fiscal system encompasses both the tax and the spending sides of government. What we should care about is whether those two functions, taken as a whole, enhance the lives of average citizens. To that end, the right focus is not how progressively we finance government spending (i.e., tax ourselves), but rather the net effect of both sides of the equation \u2014 government taxing and government spending. Does the combination of the two advance or retard Americans\u2019 prospects for a decent standard of living and equality of opportunity? It turns out that progressive fiscal outcomes do not require particularly progressive tax systems \u2014 just big ones, to support substantial government investment and insurance programs. That\u2019s because government spending invariably is very progressive: Lower-income Americans get disproportionately more value from government spending, relative to their incomes, than do the affluent, because they rely much more on public schools, social services and health care. It is easy to see that government spending on programs like food stamps, which go almost exclusively to the poor, is highly progressive. But the point applies to almost all government programs that have individual beneficiaries \u2014 every working American might receive Social Security, for example, but by design it has a progressive payout structure, because lower-income beneficiaries get more benefits relative to their contributions than do higher-income ones. Likewise, Medicare is highly subsidized out of general tax revenues, so that the value of Medicare insurance is also progressively distributed. And while it is true that about 40 percent of government spending \u2014 on highways or other infrastructure, or our defense budget \u2014 does not flow to specific beneficiaries, this spending also is progressive in its effect. In 2013, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office offered its first tentative analysis of who benefits from this general spending; it found, unsurprisingly, that the benefits from unallocated spending are broadly shared. A chief executive who earns 200 times as much as her typical employee does not get 200 times the benefit from our investments in highways. The better response to income disparity, then, is not to tax the rich more, but to boost revenue over all so that government can invest more, and offer higher quality social insurance programs. We have our work cut out for us: Our net investment in public infrastructure is only around 0.5 percent of our gross domestic product, and our social insurance programs are much smaller than those of most other developed economies. Our peer countries typically rely on large, regressive tax systems to mitigate income inequality far more than we do. For example, I compared Germany and the United States, using 2007 data (the last year unaffected by the Great Recession) collected by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The two countries had virtually equivalent levels of income inequality. Moreover, the American tax system as a whole was quite progressive, while Germany\u2019s actually was regressive. Nonetheless, the American fiscal system as whole (including state and local government spending) reduced inequality in market income \u2014 that is, income before subtracting taxes and adding back government benefits \u2014 by only 22 percent, while Germany\u2019s reduced it by 41 percent. The reason is that the German fiscal system was significantly larger in overall terms: Taxes accounted for about 36 percent of German gross domestic product, against 28 percent for the United States. It\u2019s the spending side, not the taxes, that makes the difference. In short, both conservatives and progressives get things wrong. To address troubling trends in income inequality, we need more government, not less. But we do not need steeply higher marginal income tax rates to yield a richer, more equal and happier society.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debate for Florida Governor Takes On a Hostile Edge", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 By the time the heated governor versus governor debate in Florida ended Tuesday night, it was clear no man had a fan.The debate between Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist live on CNN (which barred all fans) illustrated just how diametrically opposed the two men are stylistically and on almost every issue: the minimum wage, climate change, immigration, Cuba and medical marijuana. But it also exposed the extreme hostility the two men appear to have for each other in a race that still has them neck and neck despite a long, costly barrage of negative advertising. That animosity came to the fore last week after a disagreement over Mr. Crist\u2019s fan kept Mr. Scott offstage for seven minutes during the second debate.Tuesday\u2019s face-off focused mostly on Florida\u2019s economy, and the two men argued sharply, in large part, about money: which candidate has too much or once had too much, who was unethical about making it or accepting it, and whether Floridians in low-wage jobs deserve more of it. The back-and-forth between the men, each flashing his average-guy credentials, was meant to score points with middle-class voters.Mr. Crist, now a Democrat, accused Mr. Scott, a multimillionaire Republican, of being too rich to connect with people in his \u201cprivate jet\u201d and his \u201coceanfront mansion.\u201d And he jabbed at Mr. Scott, saying the way the governor made his money \u201cwas pretty unsavory.\u201d The reference was to Columbia/HCA, the health care company Mr. Scott once headed, which was found guilty of Medicare fraud.But Mr. Scott shot back, saying that unlike Mr. Crist, he was raised by a mother with little money and watched as his family lost its car and struggled to \u201cput food on the table\u201d and \u201cbuy Christmas presents.\u201d \u201cCharlie never went through that,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cHe never had to worry about money.\u201d Earlier, he derided Mr. Crist, who was a Republican as governor and recently became a Democrat, as someone whose principles are based on \u201cpolitical expediency,\u201d not honesty. Mr. Crist snapped back, \u201cWe lived in a small apartment in Atlanta when my father was going to medical school,\u201d adding that his father delivered newspapers to make ends meet. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, and you can\u2019t tell my story.\u201dThe hourlong debate, moderated by Jake Tapper, went on to touch on the major issues confronting voters. Foremost was job creation, an important issue in a state that was among the hardest hit during the recession.Repeating his campaign-trail mantra, Mr. Scott reminded voters that since taking office in 2011 he has created more than 650,000 jobs. Under Mr. Crist, the governor said, more than 800,000 jobs were lost in the state. \u201cThis state is now on a roll,\u201d Mr. Scott said.But Mr. Crist quickly pointed out that as governor from 2007 to 2011 he had little control over a recession that walloped the United States and the rest of the country. Florida suffered greatly because of the implosion of the real estate market, he said.\u201cI was not responsible for the global economic meltdown any more than Rick was responsible for the national economic recovery,\u201d Mr. Crist said.Mr. Crist has been a forceful proponent of raising the minimum wage in Florida to $10.10, arguing that nobody can make a living on the current wage, $7.93. Asked about the possibility that a raise could cost Florida thousands of jobs, Mr. Crist said it would be unfair not to increase it. \u201cPeople deserve it,\u201d Mr. Crist said. \u201cHow can somebody get by on $7.93 an hour?\u201d But Mr. Scott, who opposes an increase, said Mr. Crist, rather than raise the minimum wage when he served as governor, cut wages altogether because of job losses. \u201cHow many more jobs can you lose?\u201d Mr. Scott asked. \u201cYou should be known as a zero-wage governor.\u201dThe two men also parted ways on a proposed constitutional amendment to permit medical marijuana in the state. Mr. Crist, whose law partner spearheaded the effort, is for it, and Mr. Scott opposes it. And they contradicted each other on Cuba, an important issue to many Cuban-American voters in South Florida. Mr. Crist seeks to lift the United States\u2019 economic embargo, saying it has failed to work for five decades. Mr. Scott disagreed, calling the Castro brothers terrorists.Mr. Scott has come under fire for failing to acknowledge climate change, and he punted on a question about why he had taken that position.At the end, each man was asked what he wanted a \u201cdo-over\u201d on. Mr. Scott said he wished he had more time to court more companies to come to Florida.Mr. Crist said, \u201cFor me, it\u2019s pretty obvious: the opportunity to serve you again as your governor.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Claims for Jobless Benefits Decline", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, a sign the labor market may be tightening.Still, other data on Thursday showed weaker factory orders in August even after stripping out volatile transportation figures, a sign of slowing growth in manufacturing.Jobless claims have fallen steadily since the nation emerged from the 2007-9 recession and are currently lower than they were before the economic crisis began. Thursday\u2019s data is \u201cconsistent with the continued, solid performance in the labor market,\u201d said Keith B. Hembre, chief economist at Nuveen Asset Management.The jobless claims report comes a day ahead of Friday\u2019s government report on September employment. The claims data will have no bearing on the employment report because the Labor Department\u2019s survey was conducted earlier in the month. Economists expect that companies added 215,000 workers to payrolls last month.Separate data showed small businesses hiring workers at the fastest pace in eight months, further evidence of strength in the labor market. The National Federation of Independent Business said its monthly survey of its members found they added an average of 0.24 worker per business last month, on a seasonally adjusted basis.The four-week moving average of jobless claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,250, to 294,750.A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that new orders for factory goods posted their biggest decline on record in August, although the 10.1 percent drop was payback for an aircraft-driven jump a month earlier. Stripping out transportation orders, which were depressed by a plunge in the volatile aircraft component, new orders were down a more modest 0.1 percent.The manufacturing sector continues to expand, although growth may be moderating.

{"Headline": "False Teachings for India's Students", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPrime Minister Narendra Modi has promised India\u2019s youth a bright future. As he is well aware, realizing that promise will depend on dramatically increasing educational quality and opportunity for the 600 million Indians under age 25, many of whom lack basic reading and math skills. In its 2014 Election Manifesto, Mr. Modi\u2019s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, called education \u201cthe most powerful tool for the advancement of the nation and the most potent weapon to fight poverty.\u201d The question now is whether educational reform will be used not just to create an educated citizenry and trained work force but also to promote a particular ideology. While campaigning ahead of the May election, Mr. Modi, then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, promised to bring the \u201cGujarat model\u201d to national governance. Many voters understood this to mean a commitment to a more dynamic economy. But the Gujarat model has a less attractive side to it: a requirement that the state\u2019s curriculum include several textbooks written by Dinanath Batra, a scholar dedicated to recasting India\u2019s history through the prism of the Hindu right wing.In February, Mr. Batra led a successful effort to pressure Penguin India to withdraw copies of a book by Wendy Doniger, a religion professor at the University of Chicago, which he felt insulted Hinduism. Then, in June, the Gujarat government directed that several of Mr. Batra\u2019s own books be added to the state\u2019s curriculum. Mr. Batra\u2019s teachings range from the trivial to assertions that simply cannot be taken seriously. His books advise students not to celebrate birthdays with cakes and candles, a practice Mr. Batra considers non-Indian. More troublingly, they instruct students to draw maps of \u201cAkhand Bharat,\u201d a greater India, presumably restored to its rightful boundaries, that include Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tibet, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Mr. Batra also believes that aircraft, automobiles and nuclear weapons existed in ancient India, and he wants children to learn these so-called facts.In 1999, the national government, then led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, put Mr. Batra in charge of rewriting history textbooks to reflect these and other views of the Hindu right. Now it appears that the party intends to pick up where it left off when it was voted out of power in 2004. Mr. Batra says Smriti Zubin Irani, the minister of human resource development, has assured him his books will soon be a part of the national curriculum. The education of youth is too important to the country\u2019s future to allow it to be hijacked by ideology that trumps historical facts, arbitrarily decides which cultural practices are Indian, and creates dangerous notions of India\u2019s place alongside its neighbors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europeans Accuse Ireland of Giving Apple Illegal Tax Break", "Date": "2014-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a warning shot to companies shopping for tax deals around the globe, the European Commission publicly accused Ireland on Tuesday of giving illegal subsidies to Apple and cautioned that the country might need to collect back taxes from the company, which outside analysts said could reach into the billions of dollars.These findings, which constitute a preliminary indictment of Apple\u2019s past arrangements with Ireland, come as policy makers in the United States and Europe try to block some of the inventive maneuvers multinationals use to limit taxes in their home countries and reduce their worldwide payments as much as possible. The commission, the administrative arm of the 28-nation European Union, said it was focusing on rulings by the Irish tax authorities in 1991 and 2007 concerning two wholly owned Apple subsidiaries, Apple Operations Europe and Apple Sales International, which had operations in Ireland.The report found that Irish officials essentially \u201creverse-engineered\u201d Apple\u2019s tax bill by first discussing with company representatives the size of the profit they wanted from the Irish branch. Apple\u2019s own tax adviser acknowledged there was \u201cno scientific basis\u201d for the figures, the report said.That arrangement remained in effect until a 2007 reassessment, despite the remarkable growth of Apple and the market for digital technology. The case \u2014 and the question of how much Apple may ultimately have to pay \u2014 is expected to take years to play out. But even the largest estimates pale in comparison to Apple\u2019s overall profit.Both Ireland and Apple defended the tax dealings. Brian Meenan, of Ireland\u2019s Department of Finance, said on Tuesday: \u201cWe believe we\u2019re not in breach of any rules.\u201d Apple issued a statement: \u201cApple has received no selective treatment from Irish officials over the years.\u201dWhen a Senate investigative panel looked into how American companies dodged taxes by shifting profits offshore, however, Apple\u2019s operations in Ireland served as a case study. The commission, which used some of the Senate panel\u2019s research, noted that Apple enjoyed a 400 percent increase in sales revenue from 2009 to 2012. But while Apple Sales International recorded a revenue increase of 415 percent during the three years from 2009 to 2011, to $63.9 billion, the operating costs used to calculate taxable income in Ireland reportedly grew only 10 to 20 percent. Senator Carl Levin, who was chairman of the investigating Senate subcommittee, said the commission\u2019s report validated his panel\u2019s finding that Apple had negotiated a tax rate of less than 1 percent.\u201cApple developed its crown jewels \u2014 lucrative intellectual property \u2014 in the United States, used a tax loophole to shift the profits generated by that valuable property offshore to avoid paying U.S. taxes, then boosted its profits through a sweetheart deal with the Irish government,\u201d Senator Levin said in a statement.Wall Street analysts assured investors there was no need for alarm about Apple\u2019s obligations no matter what the commission ultimately rules. In a research note on Monday, Ben Reitzes, an analyst at Barclays Investment Bank, said any potential fine would have only a minor impact on Apple\u2019s financial health. Even $6 billion \u2014 the amount Apple would have paid over three years based on Ireland\u2019s full statutory tax rate \u2014 amounts to a cost of only $1 a share, he wrote.Apple isn\u2019t the only global company coming under scrutiny. The commission announced on Tuesday that there was evidence that Luxembourg gave favorable treatment to Fiat Finance and Trade, a unit of the Italian automaker Fiat. It is also looking into Starbucks\u2019 tax deals in the Netherlands.The specific focus of the case against Apple and Ireland is so-called transfer pricing \u2014 a practice that commonly involves companies moving profits and losses between subsidiaries by labeling them internal corporate payments for goods or for copyright or patent royalties.The commission\u2019s analysis aimed to prove that Irish authorities had underestimated the taxable profit of the Irish branches of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe.The report said officials never tried to calculate the transfer of payments among the parts of Apple as if they were separate companies \u2014 as standard accounting principles would require.Nor, according to the report, did the tax agreement use calculations that would adequately allow for an increase in taxes to reflect the company\u2019s rapidly growing revenue.Ireland has set its corporate tax rate at just 12.5 percent. That is roughly one-third the tax rate of other European countries, including France, whose policy makers have criticized Ireland for offering incentives to attract global companies to its shores.One country having lower tax rates than its neighbors is not against European Union rules. But it could be a violation if a country granted special deals to certain companies that were not available to others.James Stewart, a financial tax expert at Trinity College Dublin, said that even if a final ruling was years away, Tuesday\u2019s report was \u201cdamaging to Ireland.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a deeply held belief that our low corporate tax regime is central to Ireland\u2019s industrial policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be much more difficult for Ireland to give similar deals to other multinational companies.\u201dEven so, if Apple were ultimately forced to pay back taxes, Ireland would be the one to collect the windfall.Mark Scott contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Germans Are Afraid of Google", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionBERLIN \u2014 These days Germany is known for being many things: a leader in clean technology, a manufacturing powerhouse, Europe\u2019s foreign policy center. But increasingly, it seems to have taken on yet another stereotype \u2014 as a nation of Luddites.And truth be told, Germany is not a great place to be a big tech company these days. G\u00fcnther H. Oettinger, a German official and the European Union\u2019s incoming commissioner for digital economy and society, has assailed Google for having too big a presence in Europe, and speaks of \u201ccuts\u201d in the company\u2019s market power. In Berlin, Sigmar Gabriel, the vice chancellor and economics minister, is investigating whether Germany can classify Google as a vital part of the country\u2019s infrastructure, and thus make it subject to heavy state regulation. Google is often spoken of in dark terms around cafes and biergartens. People regularly call it the Octopus. Even a figure as dominant in the global economy as Mathias D\u00f6pfner, the chief executive of Springer, Germany\u2019s largest publishing house, said he was \u201cafraid of Google.\u201d Google isn\u2019t the only target of Teutonic ire. A few weeks ago, a German court prohibited Uber from operating in the country, reasoning that the company was violating federal licensing laws for professional drivers. And Amazon is entangled in a long and wearying battle over working conditions and pay with Verdi, one of Germany\u2019s most powerful unions. To outsiders, this all seems like just another instance of collective German angst. In this view, Germany is the neurotic bystander of the digital revolution, shaken to the bone by its fear of everything new and its distrust of everything American, a secretive society still traumatized by its Stasi history, overestimating the importance of data privacy. But this caricature misses the point. Germans don\u2019t fear technology. Nor do we dislike America. On the contrary: Whenever Apple debuts a new product, our media goes bananas and people line up in front of Apple\u2019s flagship stores. Most Germans use Google and Facebook on a daily basis, without ever getting sweaty hands when typing in a search term or answering a friendship request.In politics, Silicon Valley is a magic phrase. It\u2019s what Berlin wants to be. It\u2019s where our representatives and business leaders go when they want to look really cool or snoop around for ideas. Speaking at a rollout for a new book on Silicon Valley, Mr. Gabriel\u2019s eyes turned dreamy when he told the audience how he strolled the streets of Palo Alto on his first visit there in the late \u201990s, looking around for the Hewlett-Packard garage, feeling the magic of innovation in the air. What gives? How can Germany be both afraid of and in love with technology, and the companies that make it? The key is to look beyond those things, to the corporate model they represent. The true origin of the conflict lies in the economic culture innate to those former Silicon Valley start-ups \u2014 now giants \u2014 that are taking the European markets by storm. To create and grow an enterprise like Amazon or Uber takes a certain libertarian cowboy mind-set that ignores obstacles and rules. Silicon Valley fears neither fines nor political reprimand. It invests millions in lobbying in Brussels and Berlin, but since it finds the democratic political process too slow, it keeps following its own rules in the meantime. Uber simply declared that it would keep operating in Germany, no matter what the courts ruled. Amazon is pushing German publishers to offer their books on its platform at a lower price \u2014 ignoring that, in Germany, publishers are legally required to offer their books at the same price everywhere. It is this anarchical spirit that makes Germans so neurotic. On one hand, we\u2019d love to be more like that: more daring, more aggressive. On the other hand, the force of anarchy makes Germans (and many other Europeans) shudder, and rightfully so. It\u2019s a challenge to our deeply ingrained faith in the state.The German voter-consumer will always trust the state more than he will any private company, no matter how ardently it insists on being a good guy. Trust in \u201cthe state\u201d is hard to measure; polls vary greatly depending on the current government\u2019s performance and personnel, among other factors. However, Germans regularly report much higher levels of trust in the leading state institutions \u2014 the federal legislature, the courts and the police \u2014 than Americans do. No major party, right or left, calls for shrinking the size of the state; the only party to do so, the Liberal Democrats, is too small to have a seat in the Bundestag, and is fighting for its life in state-level elections. Unlike in America, where trust in the state tends to dip during hard times, in Germany it rises. When problems appear, we look to \u201cVater Staat\u201d \u2014 the Father State \u2014 to protect us. That includes challenges by \u201cdisruptive\u201d business models, like those coming out of Silicon Valley. Indeed, the reason politicians like Mr. Gabriel \u2014 who has said \u201cwe must tame Silicon Valley capitalism\u201d\u2014 go after Amazon and Uber is that it is a surefire way to get votes. Even politicians who are normally pro-deregulation, like Mr. Oettinger, know it\u2019s smart to come down hard on tech companies. If it wants to succeed here, Silicon Valley needs to comply with the particularities of the German and European market. We love technology, but we want it delivered on our terms. In Germany, cowboys should remain in the movies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany and China Seal Meeting With Business Deals", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China here with full military honors on Friday before the two leaders and their ministers announced more than 2 billion euro, or $2.5 billion, worth of cooperation and investment deals involving Volkswagen, Daimler and some of Germany\u2019s other leading companies.The deals sprang from the third bilateral encounter between leaders of Germany and China since the countries forged a government-level exchange program in 2011.Another big beneficiary was the European aircraft maker Airbus, in which the German government holds a stake, which signed a deal to sell 70 A320 single-aisle jets to China\u2019s state purchasing agency.In all, the German and Chinese leaders signed a 52-page document detailing areas of cooperation that included pushing for the rapid conclusion to talks between the European Union and China on an investment pact, and a raft of projects aimed at fostering innovation in the health, education, climate, energy and technology sectors.Ms. Merkel praised the day\u2019s meetings and deals as an \u201cindication of marked cooperation\u201d between the two countries. The arrangements over the last three years have contributed to steady growth in bilateral trade, with 6.1 percent of German exports heading to China in 2013, compared with 1.6 percent in 2000. Trade between the two countries amounted to \u20ac140 billion in 2013.Recent figures, however, point to a cooling of the German economy. According to official data released on Thursday, German exports overall slumped 5.8 percent in August compared with July, the sharpest drop since 2009; they were driven down by unease linked to the conflict in Ukraine and tensions with Russia, as well as decreasing demand for German goods.In fact, European stocks fell on Friday, with Germany\u2019s leading share index, the DAX, down 2.4 percent amid fears of an economic slowdown in Europe and Asia. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks eurozone blue-chip shares, fell about 1.7 percent.Mr. Li forecast that his country would see growth of about 7.5 percent this year, despite the turbulence, adding that the Chinese economy had \u201ca lot of room for maneuver.\u201dGermany has enjoyed a special relationship to China, given its relatively uncomplicated history with the Asian country. Yet some analysts question how long the honeymoon phase between Berlin and Beijing can last. Points of contention in the business sector have begun to emerge as the Chinese authorities have accused major foreign firms of unfair practices.That made it all the more notable that Volkswagen agreed on Friday to extend its joint venture with China\u2019s FAW Group by 25 years, pledging to invest 100 million euros in the Xinjiang region. VW has been present in China since the 1980s and currently operates eight facilities that produce cars and nine that make components.Ms. Merkel described Friday\u2019s meeting with Mr. Li as \u201copen and intense,\u201d but noted that she had brought up the issues of fair markets, rule of law and human rights.Sebastian Heilmann, director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin, cautioned that the relationship between Germany and China \u201chas the potential to be shaken by open conflict.\u201dHe noted that the two also faced growing competition with each other in several critical sectors that could further strain ties.\u201cThere will be increased future competition in areas where the Germans are strong suppliers, such as mechanical tools, industrial parts and heating technology,\u201d Mr. Heilmann said. \u201cThe Germans are climbing the ladder, and the Chinese are climbing right behind them.\u201dMr. Li said there had been no change to China\u2019s policy of allowing Hong Kong to be governed by a different system than that of mainland China, but he would not be drawn into answering a question about China\u2019s plans to have nominees for the post of top official vetted by a committee loyal to Beijing.\u201cMaintaining Hong Kong\u2019s long-term stability and prosperity is not only in China\u2019s interest, but all the more in the interest of the city\u2019s inhabitants,\u201d Mr. Li said. He pledged to \u201cprotect the legitimate interests of all foreign investors\u201d in Hong Kong.After a business meeting in the northern port city of Hamburg over the weekend, Mr. Li will travel to Russia, where he is to meet President Vladimir V. Putin, before continuing to Milan to attend a meeting of Asian and European leaders on Oct. 16 and 17.Experts expect Germany to seek to persuade Mr. Li to use his influence with Mr. Putin to move toward a resolution of the simmering crisis in Ukraine. \u201cThe Germans are hoping the Chinese can have a moderating influence over Russia,\u201d Mr. Heilmann said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Live Performances Redefine Frieze London\u2019s Limits", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Art of Collecting: Frieze LondonLONDON \u2014 Soup cooked with vegetables grown in Fukushima. Choreographic services to hire by the hour. A reflexologist helping to contemplate the notion of vacationing. Slow-motion floats. Action-sculptures animated by the public.Yes, it\u2019s all art or whatever you want to call it, part of Frieze Live, a new program at the must-see, must-do annual art world circus that is the Frieze Art Fair here, running Oct. 15-18. The Live program arrives at a moment when performance art and dance seem to have made permanent inroads into contemporary art museums and the broader culture. Since 2012, the Tate Modern has had a permanent space dedicated to performance, installations and experimental film. The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Pompidou Center in Paris and a number of other prestigious museums regularly bring choreographers and performance artists into their galleries. The biennial Performa festival in New York, relatively modest in 2007, its first year, has grown bigger and more ambitious with each new edition. (The influence works both ways; performance was the theme of this year\u2019s Biennale de la Danse in Lyon, France.) But, as the introduction of the Frieze Live program suggests, works that have traditionally been at the furthest edge of the avant-garde, discipline-blurring and hard to define, have entered not only institutions and festivals, but also the marketplace. The introduction of the Frieze Live program suggests that live art \u2014 a phrase that can encompass performance art, installation work and ephemeral experimental work\u2014 is now uncontroversially part of a larger commercial field.\u201cIt\u2019s really not unusual for collectors or institutions to buy this kind of work; performances, ephemeral or temporary work, installations,\u201d said Matthew Slotover, who founded the Frieze Art Fair with Amanda Sharp in 2003. \u201cWe noticed that a lot of commercial galleries are doing this kind of work in a very ambitious way, and we wanted to give them the opportunity to represent these artists at the fair.\u201dNicola Lees, the curator of Frieze Live, said the program was developed after discussions about how the fair could support these more experimental practices. \u201cWe have always had some interesting live performances and people like Tino Sehgal at the fair,\u201d Ms. Lees said by telephone. \u201cBut it\u2019s often hard to know how to integrate this kind of work into a conventional fair setup. So we decided to create a formal program and really work with the artists early on, so that we can set it all up.\u201dFrieze Live features six galleries and their chosen artists, selected from about 140 entries. A selection committee made up of seven members from international galleries and headed by Ms. Lees worked through the proposals and made studio visits. Finally, the committee pared the choices down to six propositions from galleries.\u201cWe had at least 20 that were excellent,\u201d Mr. Slotover said. \u201cIt was tough.\u201dTwo of the projects are recreations of older works, which Ms. Lees said was an opportunity to bring important artists in the live-art field to the attention of a younger public. The Galerie Jocelyn Wolff from Paris is bringing two action-sculptures \u2014 which must be animated by the public through a series of instructions \u2014 made by the German artist Franz Erhard Walther in 1968 and 1975. A pioneer of relational aesthetics, or forms of participatory art, Mr. Walther\u2019s sewn-canvas sculptures were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1970. The second historical production is from another Paris gallery, the gb agency, which is offering a restaging of the American artist Robert Breer\u2019s \u201cFloats,\u201d a slow-motion progression of motorized sculptures originally created for the 1970 World\u2019s Fair in Osaka, Japan. \u201cRobert Breer taught most of his life at Cooper Union, collaborated with Stockhausen, and was an important influence on a younger generation of artists,\u201d Ms. Lees said, referring to the college in New York and the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. \u201cThe fair has over 50,000 people in the four or five days it\u2019s open, so it\u2019s a great opportunity for this work to be seen.\u201dWhether anyone will buy these pieces, including the four that are being created for the fair, is an intriguing question. Adam Linder, the Australian-born, Berlin-based choreographer who danced with the Royal Ballet before switching to the contemporary dance companies of Michael Clark and Meg Stuart, and who is represented by the Silberkuppe Gallery in Berlin, said that his work, \u201cSome Proximity,\u201d is not for sale, but can be rented by the hour. \u201cIt\u2019s a real-time way of valuing the specificity of choreography, a subjective real-time practice,\u201d Mr. Linder said by telephone.What this means is that Mr. Linder, along with the dancer Justin Kennedy, will respond in dance form to an art writer, Jonathan P. Watts, moving through the fair and making critical notes that are brought back to the dancers. \u201cOnce these short criticisms are written, Justin and I will work through several choreographic modalities that translate the text,\u201d Mr. Linder said. \u201cThe notion is not only a real-time positing of an economy for the subjective labor, it\u2019s also the idea that the choreography is at work and is transforming something.\u201dDominic Eichler and Michel Ziegler, who run the Silberkuppe Gallery, said they had represented Mr. Linder for three years and had sold his work. \u201cWhat we both like about the new live section of Frieze is that the booths are integrated into the fair,\u201d Mr. Eichler said.Asked who might hire \u201cSome Proximity\u201d and why, Mr. Linder said that art institutions \u201cmight be interested in questions of real-time embodiment of the economic labor of choreography today.\u201d He added that a private collector might also be interested in conceptual work.\u201cSomeone might throw a dinner party and might like to have that happening,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting for me is that it\u2019s not just about moving out of the theater and into the exhibition space. It\u2019s about choreography asserting its temporality.\u201d The other Live projects are very different. Tamara Henderson\u2019s work, presented by the Rodeo gallery in Istanbul, \u201cis based on the idea of resorts and vacationing,\u201d Ms. Lees said. In addition to a slide presentation and an audio element, Ms. Lees said Ms. Henderson would be showing furniture she has made from pulped travel brochures.United Brothers, from the Green Tea Gallery in Iwaki, Japan, are offering soup at lunchtime, made by the artists\u2019 mother from vegetables grown after the radiation disaster in Fukushima. The United Brothers website offers a photograph of a scarily green liquid, with the tagline: \u201cDoes this soup taste ambivalent?\u201dAnd then there is that must-have part of any art-going experience: the gift shop, set up by Shanzhai Biennial, two artists who have turned their fascination with fake brand-name luxury items into a possibly commercial, or possibly cryptic, art-world venture. \u201cThe shop will be in the entrance hall to the fair, and all the items will be Frieze-themed,\u201d Ms. Lees said. \u201cThere will be a range from inexpensive items to couture outfits, and the sales assistants will be in a performing role. I\u2019m sure some people will think it really is a Frieze shop.\u201d (Insofar as objects can be bought, it really is a Frieze shop.)The Live program offerings are not the only performance or ephemeral pieces to be seen at the fair. Frieze Projects, a program of artist commissions that is also run by Ms. Lees, this year has a strong focus on the intersection with other disciplines, notably dance. A collaboration between the artist Nick Mauss and Northern Ballet; offsite \u201csymposiums\u201d held by the choreographer and performer Isabel Lewis in a raw space above the Selfridges department store; and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel\u2019s \u201cDisabled Theater\u201d are all on the program. They are not, however, for sale.\u201cThis fashion for performance, for \u2018live\u2019 in a museum or gallery, is surely because it is entirely another experience, and a fulfilling one, for people who are not used to looking at things for a long duration,\u201d said Mr. Bel, who might best be described as a conceptual choreographer, but whose medium is a theatrical one. \u201cPerformance has entered the market, now dance is there too,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been protected from commercialism in the dance world by not having any material value. We need to think carefully whether we want to participate in this, or resist it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Washington needs more women like Gwen Graham.\u201dIn a district that until 2010 had not elected a Republican for more than a century, her gilded family name has allowed Ms. Graham, 51, to raise more money than the incumbent, a rarity, and to use it to run television political ads as early as June.\u201cHe has turnout in his favor,\u201d Fred Piccolo Jr., a Republican political consultant, said of Mr. Southerland. \u201cBut she has taken the confluence of name and the ability to raise money and the automatic gravitas that comes with that and parlayed it into a smart message.\u201dBut Mr. Southerland, the 49-year-old co-owner of his family-run funeral home chain who co-founded a Panama City Tea Party group, has three powerful forces on his side: voters\u2019 antipathy to President Obama, their deep-rooted opposition to his Affordable Health Care law and the growing inclination to vote Republican.\u201cI\u2019ve been a Democrat for 50-something years,\u201d said Mike Castleberry, a Southerland supporter, as he walked to his car at a Walmart here. \u201cBut in 2008, I realized I had nothing in common with what they are promoting.\u201dIn recent weeks, Mr. Southerland has ratcheted up his campaign, increasing his fund-raising and running a spate of advertisements that tie Ms. Graham to Mr. Obama; the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi; and the health care law. Mr. Southerland also portrays Ms. Graham, who traded a law career to stay at home with her three children and eventually work as a school district administrator in Tallahassee, as a candidate who does not represent North Florida values, is less moderate than she claims and shrugs off job creation.\u201cPeople want to be rewarded for their work and their labor,\u201d Mr. Southerland said in an interview. \u201cThey feel that right now the federal government has encroached upon that ability.\u201d\u201cThis is a Democratic economy,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd they are going to have to own it.\u201dBut some political analysts said Mr. Southerland had run a relatively lackluster campaign marked by a series of missteps that Ms. Graham has deftly used against him, particularly with female voters, a crucial constituency. Mr. Southerland complained that his salary, $174,000, considerably steeper than the wages of most people in his district, was not that high, considering the risks of the job and the loss of his business income. He also led the charge to toughen the food stamp program.More recently, supporters sent official campaign invitations for an all-male private fund-raiser for Mr. Southerland that harked back to \u201cthe 12th century with King Arthur\u2019s Round Table.\u201dAsked by the press last month to comment on the invitation, Mr. Southerland, who said he had not seen it, replied: \u201cListen, has Gwen Graham ever been to a lingerie shower? Ask her. And how many men were there?\u201dIn a recent interview, he emphasized that he is surrounded by five women \u2014 four daughters and a wife. \u201cThey know that women have no stronger supporter than me.\u201dSome voters have dismissed the hubbub as politics as usual. But Ms. Graham and her supporters have pilloried him for his statement and his stance on women\u2019s issues, in general, including a vote against the Violence Against Women Act and equal pay for women.\u201cThis whole thing felt very \u2018Mad Men'-ish to me,\u201d Ms. Graham said. \u201cIt\u2019s a demeaning response to women and indicative of his worldview.\u201dMs. Graham, a self-described \u201cglass half-full\u201d person and mother of two sons and a daughter, said she decided to run last year after she got fed up with Congress\u2019s inability to function. She contrasted that with what she described as her father\u2019s ability to find common ground with Republicans and not demonize his opponents.\u201cI have the ability to look at the issues from a neutral position and talk to both sides,\u201d Ms. Graham said. \u201cCompromise means that you are not going to get everything you want.\u201dDespite the district\u2019s location, demographics are on her side. There are more registered female voters than male, and more Democrats than Republicans, although some wear the label so lightly that they seldom vote for Democrats. The vote is often split: Republicans for president and Democrats for Congress and local offices. Alex Sink, a Democrat, won the district in her unsuccessful campaign against Gov. Rick Scott in 2010.What\u2019s more, Ms. Graham\u2019s anchor is Leon County, which includes the capital, Tallahassee. It is a city loaded with professors, students and African-Americans who skew left and government workers, some of whom do not look kindly on Mr. Southerland\u2019s 2013 vote to shut down the government. Leon County makes up more than 40 percent of the 14-county district.The political landscape grows less hospitable for Ms. Graham the farther west one travels. But even in towns like this, she has supporters, particularly among women and African-Americans.\u201cSoutherland could still be rescued by the partisan leanings of the district,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if Democrats were to lose this race, it would be terribly demoralizing for their party after nominating such a strong candidate.\u201dAn article on Monday about the congressional campaign of Gwen Graham in Florida referred incorrectly to one of her children. She has two sons and a daughter, not three sons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Illinois Speech, Obama Trumpets Economic Success as Midterm Vote Nears", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEVANSTON, Ill. \u2014 President Obama, outlining a campaign message for his party a month before the midterm elections, used a visit to his home state on Thursday to highlight the country\u2019s economic growth and to make his case on a handful of issues that are important to Democrats in November.\u201cI am not on the ballot this fall,\u201d Mr. Obama said in an address at Northwestern University here. \u201cBut make no mistake, these policies are on the ballot.\u00a0Every single one of them.\u201dThe president argued that the issues he was highlighting \u2014 raising the minimum wage, ensuring equal pay for women and requiring paid family leave for workers \u2014 would help the economy. But the speech was also intended to help Democratic candidates who are nervous about their prospects and have been eager for Mr. Obama to frame their arguments against the Republicans on a national stage. \u201cWhen alarms go off somewhere in the world, this is who the world calls \u2014 America,\u201d the president said in a speech that lasted a little less than an hour. \u201cThey don\u2019t call Moscow. They don\u2019t call Beijing. They call us.\u00a0We welcome that responsibility and leadership. That\u2019s who we are.\u201dMr. Obama made only a halfhearted attempt at denying that his return home to the Chicago area was aimed at rallying Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you who to vote for, although I suppose it\u2019s kind of implied,\u201d he said to laughter. During his Illinois visit, Mr. Obama was welcomed by the state\u2019s top Democratic officials, unlike in states where his popularity has sagged. The president was joined in Evanston by Senator Richard Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, and Gov. Pat Quinn, both of whom are up for re-election next month.Mr. Obama, after spending Wednesday night in his own home on Chicago\u2019s South Side, began the day at a $50,000-per-person fund-raiser for Mr. Quinn that was attended by about 25 people \u2014 but no reporters \u2014 in a high-rise overlooking Lake Michigan on the city\u2019s Gold Coast. \u201cHe likes the fact that I\u2019m a \u2018grinder,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Quinn said in an interview.Mr. Obama remains popular here among core Democratic constituencies, and Mr. Quinn is unapologetic in his embrace of the president. \u201cIt\u2019s an immense help to have him here,\u201d said Mr. Quinn, adding that he hoped Mr. Obama would return for a campaign rally before Nov. 4.Mr. Durbin, who is not expected to face much difficulty at the polls, said much the same.\u201cIf we can narrow this down and focus on the economy and its future,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll have a better chance of winning.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jean Tirole\u2019s Nobel Prize Is Also a Win for Modern Microeconomic Theory", "Date": "2014-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNobel WinnerMr. Tirole is a French economic theorist whose work is central to the work of the Federal Trade Commission and similar regulators around the world who have been given the task of ensuring that commerce is not overly distorted by the exercise of market power. The issues are complex and subtle, as competition policy affects not only the prices that are set, but also the incentives to produce more, to invest (or overinvest), to merge and to innovate.The online chatter among my economist friends today has been entirely enthusiastic about Mr. Tirole\u2019s prize. The consensus is that he represents the very best of economics. He tackles big problems, he develops new tools when they\u2019re needed, and his research is always grounded in the real world.While Mr. Tirole\u2019s work is abstract, in the sense that it involves mathematical modeling of the likely responses of firms, suppliers, customers and regulators to one another, it is also very much grounded in a subtle understanding of the specific markets he has studied. Mr. Tirole\u2019s scholarship is not about extolling the elegant simplicity of an all-knowing, omnipotent invisible hand that always finds the best possible outcome. Rather, his research explores the messier reality in which markets are populated by monopolists seeking to exploit their market power, entrepreneurs trying to fool regulators, and regulators whose choices are constrained by imperfect information, political constraints and their own human foibles.While the previous generation of economists had been engaged in the search for very simple rules that could apply to the regulation of all markets, Mr. Tirole has shown that the right rule for protecting the public interest depends critically on the details of a market.For instance, when regulators link the prices that firms are allowed to charge to their costs, it may be harmful because it limits their incentive to find innovative ways to cut costs. But there may be an offsetting benefit if it blunts the incentives for those firms to cut costs by reducing quality. This offsetting quality effect is an important consideration when customers can\u2019t judge quality for themselves, but should be ignored when customers can figure out the quality of a good before buying it.In another example, regulators had historically not been overly worried about monopolists embedded in a production chain. Their view was that competition among such monopolists\u2019 suppliers or customers would prevent them from further exploiting their monopoly power in the next link of the production chain. But in some cases, a monopolist may actually disrupt competition at the next stage. For instance, the inventor of a cost-saving innovation might garner a bigger profit by selling the new idea to just one firm rather than 10. Effectively, that single customer is buying the right to monopolize the next stage of the market, and so is willing to pay more than 10 times the competitive price for the innovation. Of course, it\u2019s willing to do this only if it can be guaranteed that it will be the only buyer given access to that innovation.To take another case, an earlier rule of thumb had suggested that regulators should always be suspicious of firms that set their price below their marginal cost, because they\u2019re probably just trying to drive competitors out of the market. But many newspapers are given away for free, and none of them seem like future media monopolists. Rather, the newspapers are given away in an effort to increase circulation, which in turn increases advertising revenue.The new economy has also provided fertile territory for Mr. Tirole. The development of new platforms, such as video game platforms like the Xbox or Sony PlayStation, provide a layer of complexity not present in most markets, because gamers need games, and game developers need gamers. Similar issues arise whenever the behavior of buyers depends on that of sellers, and vice versa, such as in the markets for credit cards, social media and search engines.Given his interests in understanding linkages within and between markets, it\u2019s little surprise that Mr. Tirole has turned his attention to understanding the appropriate regulatory response to the interconnectedness of the financial system.The conclusions of Mr. Tirole\u2019s style of analysis defy easy political characterization. In some cases they may call for a more vigorous regulatory response from government policy makers than is currently the norm, while in others, they call for greater restraint. In each case, the recommended policy depends on the details of the particular market, and in particular on what information is available; what contracts can be written; and how competitors, suppliers and customers are likely to respond.In turn, this shows just how much Mr. Tirole\u2019s work is a sophisticated mash-up of the three recent Nobel-winning themes that have revolutionized microeconomic theory. His research extends and applies the tools of game theory, which is used to analyze strategic interactions between firms and their competitors, suppliers, customers and regulators. It takes seriously the problem of imperfect information, analyzing how these interactions are shaped by what each of these players knows about the others. And he has been a pioneer within contract theory, assessing the consequences of the difficulty of writing contracts that fully specify the consequences of commercial transactions. This prize represents a vote of confidence in the direction of modern microeconomic theory.While we economists applaud Mr. Tirole for having pushed back the frontiers of knowledge, all of us should also be grateful that we live somewhat better lives in part because of his role in creating policies that better direct market forces toward serving the public good. And that\u2019s not so complicated a desire.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once Again, a Carter Aims to Govern in Georgia ", "Date": "2014-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot surprisingly, his Democratic rival, Mr. Carter, appears to have decided that he has better options than playing the famous grandfather card.Instead, Mr. Carter, 39, has incessantly pummeled Mr. Deal on ethics issues and criticized the governor for Georgia\u2019s underfunded education system \u2014 which, Mr. Carter argues, helps explain the state\u2019s poor jobs numbers. \u201cGovernor Deal has brought us to the bottom,\u201d Mr. Carter said at an Atlanta candidates forum last month. \u201cAnd we\u2019re beginning to reap what we\u2019ve sown.\u201dAs a result, the governor\u2019s race here, like the United States Senate candidacy of Michelle Nunn \u2014 daughter of another venerable Democrat, former Senator Sam Nunn \u2014 may offer rare hope for Democrats in the Deep South. Polls show Ms. Nunn in a close race with her Republican opponent, David Perdue. The question Mr. Carter and Ms. Nunn face is whether anything can break the Republican hold on Georgia.Mr. Deal has more going for him than just his party label. With an unobtrusive demeanor and a gentle Southern drawl, Mr. Deal, a former state senator and United States representative, has won every election he has run in since 1980. In 1995, while serving in Congress, he switched from Democrat to Republican, reflecting the broader shift occurring among Georgia\u2019s white voters.One hurdle this time, said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University, is the possibility that conservative voters, soured by continuing ethics controversies tied to Mr. Deal\u2019s 2010 campaign, may see him as \u201ca candidate that they cannot get really excited about,\u201d and sit out the election.\u201cIt\u2019s simply the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Deal said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to campaign on.\u201dIn 2010, Mr. Deal resigned from Congress before his term ended so that he could focus on his run for governor. His resignation came minutes before the House Ethics Committee had to decide whether to continue an investigation begun by the Office of Congressional Ethics. The office prepared a report in February 2010 saying it had found \u201csubstantial reason to believe\u201d that he might have violated House rules by meeting with state officials to try to preserve a vehicle inspection program that had \u201cgenerated significant personal financial benefit for him\u201d as one of the owners of a salvage company.The separate complaints considered by the Georgia ethics board included accusations that Mr. Deal\u2019s campaign improperly paid more than $200,000 to an aircraft company that he partly owned. Even though these and other complaints were dismissed or settled in 2012, elements of the story have lingered in the courts and in the news media.Mr. Carter in July called for an investigation into the handling of the ethics complaints, saying that there had been a \u201cpattern of intimidation and interference\u201d from the governor\u2019s office. Mr. Deal, in a debate with Mr. Carter this month, said that his office had not interfered in the ethics commission\u2019s work. \u201cIf we had, we would have been indicted by somebody,\u201d he said.Ms. Kalberman received a subpoena ordering her to turn over documents related to one of Mr. Deal\u2019s ethics cases to prosecutors by Jan. 14. Bob Page, a spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Atlanta, said Thursday that the office would \u201cneither confirm nor deny an investigation.\u201dIf the ethics issues amount to inside baseball for many voters, Mr. Carter is betting that the issue of underfunded schools will strike a more universal chord. Since 2003, the Georgia General Assembly has failed to fund public schools at the levels set by the legislature\u2019s own formula.The recession exacerbated the funding gaps, which exceeded $1 billion every year between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2014, according to Claire Suggs, senior education policy analyst at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.Mr. Carter has been relentless in blaming Mr. Deal. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear the governor make excuses and try to pass the buck,\u201d he told a group of educators at a speech in Atlanta last month, adding, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201dMr. Deal defends his record, noting that spending on education increased this year. He also says he deserves credit for shepherding the state through \u201ctough times\u201d and making difficult choices while balancing budgets.He has also plowed ahead with his message that Georgia\u2019s economy is on the right track. His TV ads are full of workers lauding the industry he has attracted to the state. Mr. Carter, in his bid to win moderate voters, has said he will not raise taxes. Instead, he has promised to find money for schools by collecting unpaid taxes and targeting waste in government. The Deal campaign has derided these proposals as not serious.On a recent morning in Marietta, an Atlanta suburb with many conservative and moderate voters, Dan Clark, 51, a salesman, said that Mr. Deal\u2019s ethics issues seemed more like typical politics than a real problem.\u201cI\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Mr. Clark said, adding that Mr. Deal had been \u201ca good, ethical governor.\u201dFor Darrell Moser, a retired pilot, Mr. Carter\u2019s education message resonated, at least enough that Mr. Moser was willing to give the Democrat a close look.\u201cI had no idea about those accusations about cutting all of this money from the school system,\u201d said Mr. Moser, 71, a self-described conservative.But how would Mr. Carter\u2019s famous grandfather figure into his deliberation?\u201cI don\u2019t favor Jimmy Carter very much,\u201d Mr. Moser replied. \u201cBut I try to have an open mind.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Robust Economy, Poland Navigates Around Eastern Europe\u2019s Strains", "Date": "2014-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRZGOW, Poland \u2014 To the east, Russian aggression has paralyzed Ukraine\u2019s hope for faster economic development. To the south, Hungary flirts with authoritarianism and still struggles to climb out of the last recession. To the north, Lithuania and the other Baltic States are being squeezed by the cycle of escalating trade sanctions between Moscow and the European Union.Poland, meanwhile, has managed to navigate safely around the latest strains on Eastern Europe, just as it managed to sail through the 2008 financial crisis with barely a bruise, maintaining solid growth rates, attracting considerable new investment and industry and using its relative economic strength to build clout within the European Union.By dint of its size, enthusiasm for embracing the West and stable governance, Poland, a member of NATO and the European Union, has long been the most important model of post-Soviet transformation. But now, with Russia again seeking to exert its influence and much of Europe struggling to recover fully from the deep downturn of recent years, Poland has taken on an even more important role as the leading symbol of regional stability and resolve.Construction cranes stretch across the Warsaw skyline. Huge malls and gleaming stores open almost daily. Attracted by wage rates considerably lower than those in Western Europe, many multinational companies continue to invest in Poland as a manufacturing and distribution base.Virtually everything that Ikea, the Swedish housewares behemoth, sells in Europe, for instance, is manufactured in Poland. Many Volkswagen components are made in Poland. General Motors has facilities here, as do 3M, Procter & Gamble and other American brands.Amazon is opening giant new distribution centers. Google Campus Warsaw, mirrored on similar projects in London and Tel Aviv, will nurture homegrown high-tech start-ups.Intent on ensuring that it is not vulnerable to Russian pressure, Poland is pressing the European Union to do more to break its reliance on Russian energy supplies. The recent rounds of sanctions and countersanctions over Russia\u2019s aggression in neighboring Ukraine have had relatively little impact on Poland\u2019s economy, beyond inspiring a patriotic campaign to persuade Poles to eat more homegrown apples in reaction to Moscow\u2019s banning of them.\u201cThere has been a small dip in trade with Russia, but double-digit growth in exports,\u201d said Mateusz Szczurek, minister of finance, with a shrug. \u201cThey find a way around.\u201dPoland is the only nation in Europe to see growth in every quarter since the financial crisis hit six years ago, with its gross domestic product now 25 percent above 2008 levels while the European Union average remains below that year\u2019s mark. In 2003, Poland exported $53 billion worth of goods. Last year, it was $203 billion. And now some Polish businesses, like Grupa Azoty, Europe\u2019s second-largest fertilizer company, are investing in other nations, something almost unheard-of just a few years ago.There is evidence that the rapid rate of growth might not be sustainable and that the economy has vulnerabilities.Growth in Poland\u2019s G.D.P., which remained robust in the first years of the financial crisis \u2014 4.5 percent in 2011, for instance, according to the World Bank \u2014 slowed the last two years, to 1.9 percent in 2012 and 1.6 percent last year. The government\u2019s budget deficit is at worrisome levels and consumer spending, which fueled the Polish economy early in the crisis, has begun to slacken.But even with its limits, the strength of the Polish economy has helped give the country additional credibility and influence in Europe, especially as other countries, like France, Spain and Italy, have stumbled. The most recent evidence for this was the election of Donald Tusk, Poland\u2019s prime minister, as president of the European Council, the first leader from a former Soviet bloc nation to hold such a top-level position.\u201cIt is a source of great satisfaction that our voice is better heard and the Polish prominence in European politics is growing,\u201d President Bronislaw Komorowski said in an interview.Poland, with more than 38 million citizens, is by far the most populous of the former Soviet satellite states; four times the size of the Czech Republic, for instance. And it has by far the largest economy in the region.Stanislaw Gomulka, a lecturer for 35 years at the London School of Economics and a longtime adviser to the Polish government, was one of the economists who shaped the \u201cshock therapy\u201d that transformed the Polish economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union and laid the groundwork for the current prosperity. He says those early reforms played a major role in Poland\u2019s economic vitality, as did the auspicious arrival of a gush of European Union aid \u2014 so far about 139 billion euros, or $180 billion, with an additional 106 billion euros, or $138 billion, set to land by 2020.\u201cThe E.U. money became available in May of 2005, but it took about three years to produce suitable projects on which to spend it, so the investment started to hit the economy just as the financial crisis was happening,\u201d Mr. Gomulka said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the luck comes in.\u201dThe nation\u2019s low levels of corporate and household debt helped, too.Total household debt, in particular, is below 60 percent of total disposable income in Poland, compared with 93 percent in Germany, 140 percent in Spain and 150 percent in Britain.\u201cThe main reason is mortgage debt,\u201d said Witold Orlowski, director of the Warsaw University of Technology Business School. In Poland, the banking sector is quite conservative, he said. Mortgages are not easy to get. And a brief economic downturn in the early 2000s further dampened housing demand just at the moment many other nations were diving headfirst into the subprime morass.\u201cGiven a little more time, we might have made the same mistakes as everyone else,\u201d he said.But there are warning signs, economists say.In the prelude to national elections in 2007, the current opposition party proposed a broad package of tax cuts without commensurate trims to spending. Not wanting to hurt its electoral chances, the current governing party endorsed the plan, which economists even at the time recognized would inevitably raise government deficits.Indeed, the deficits grew so large that, in the last two years, the government had to take steps to address them \u2014 including steps that some economists attack as accounting gimmickry.All of this has begun to have an impact on domestic consumer spending, Mr. Gomulka said.Economists say that Poland will have to invest more in education and technology and encourage new industries and homegrown brands if it wants to maintain its progress and competitiveness.\u201cThe feeling in Poland is that we must move toward a much more innovative economy,\u201d Mr. Orlowski said.Ryszard Petru, president of the Association of Polish Economists, said more difficult medicine may be needed to keep Poland\u2019s economy humming.\u201cWe are running out of lower hanging fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to grow faster than 2 percent a year or we will never catch up with countries in Western Europe.\u201dAnd to make that happen will likely mean reshaping the Polish economy so it will grow into something more like Germany and other Western powerhouses, instead of being merely a part of the supply chain for those richer nations. There are no globally recognized Polish brands.\u201cPoland has to become the country that makes the final goods, with our own brands,\u201d Mr. Petru said. \u201cThat is the challenge of the next 25 years.\u201dBut despite these potential storm clouds, many see continuing signs of opportunity.Amazon\u2019s cavernous new facility \u2014 1.1 million square feet of shelves, forklifts and furniture still wrapped in plastic \u2014 is rising outside Poznan in western Poland, the first of three such \u201cfulfillment centers\u201d the company is building in the country.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever gone to another country with such a sizable investment, this much footprint, this much real estate or these many jobs in the first year,\u201d Kerry Person, the new chief of operations for Amazon in Central and Eastern Europe, said as he toured the new facility. It was a sign, he said, of Amazon\u2019s faith in Poland\u2019s economic future. Certainly, there are plentiful signs that free-market capitalism is buzzing in Poland despite the economic travails of the region.One day recently, Lech Walesa, the Gdansk shipyard worker who led his nation to independence and became its first president, sat in a small interview area at one corner of the sprawling Ptak Fashion City, a 660,000-square-foot exhibition center and temple to design that was having its grand opening on the plains south of Lodz, Poland\u2019s textile center. He was one of the event\u2019s star attractions, but was drawing far less attention than the visiting fashion superstars Kenzo Takada, Anna Fendi and Patricia Gucci.Down an aisle lined with cubicles of plaid overalls, leather capes and T-shirts reading \u201cR.I.P. Diet\u201d and \u201cWeird on Top,\u201d just beyond a flock of models in pink miniskirts, a cluster of jeweled fashionistas was studying a rack of necklaces made from bullets. \u201cBetter Wear Than Use,\u201d the company slogan went.\u201cIf someone told me, when we were fighting against the Communists, that we would have such a place in Poland in 20 years, I would not have believed it,\u201d said Mr. Walesa as he gazed upon the raging capitalism all around him. \u201cThis is what I fought for.\u201dJoanna Berendt contributed reporting from Poznan, Poland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Shows His Hand", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few days ago, The Financial Times published an interview with a Russian businessman named Sergei Pugachev. Once an ally of President Vladimir Putin, Pugachev owned shipbuilding and construction interests, as well as a bank. Indeed, he was once known as \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s banker.\u201d But his bank collapsed a few years ago, and, in 2012, the government seized his two shipyards. Jointly valued at $3.5 billion by the accounting firm of BDO, they were sold to a competitor, the United Shipbuilding Corporation, for $422.5 million, according to the paper.The chairman of United Shipbuilding at the time was Igor Sechin, one of Putin\u2019s closest associates and the head of Rosneft, the state oil company. Russian businessmen, Pugachev complained to The Financial Times, had become nothing more than \u201cserfs\u201d in Russia. \u201cToday in Russia, there is no private property,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are only serfs who belong to Putin.\u201dAnd so it goes in Putin\u2019s Russia.I had been making inquiries, hoping to find out whether the sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe in the wake of Russia\u2019s takeover of Crimea were working. The answer, I believe, is yes, but not necessarily in the way you\u2019d think.Although the mounting problems have been coincident with the sanctions, it is impossible to say for sure whether there is a direct correlation. (One thing that is making a difference, I should note, is the boom in American oil and gas, which has produced a glut of fossil fuel and has helped depress prices.) The direct effect will more likely be felt in the near future, when, for instance, Russian companies have to refinance their debt despite being locked out of Western capital markets.What the sanctions have done, though, is bring out the worst tendencies of Putin and his close associates, putting them on display for all to see. The rule of law has long been a fiction in Russia, but, for years, Western businessmen \u2014 and Russian businessmen as well \u2014 made excuses. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former oligarch who spent 10 years in the Russian prison system, had foolishly decided to take Putin on politically, they would say.But since the sanctions have been put in place, McDonald\u2019s restaurants, which had never had any problems before in Russia, are suddenly being closely inspected and a handful shut down. Other Western companies are having similar troubles.Or take the case of Vladimir Yevtushenkov, a Russian billionaire who ran Sistema, a big conglomerate. One of Sistema\u2019s assets was Bashneft, Russia\u2019s sixth-largest oil company by output. Last month, Yevtushenkov was placed under house arrest, accused of money laundering. After a court hearing, his shares in Bashneft were seized by the government.Yevtushenkov was not politically active like Khodorkovsky. He was no threat to Putin. But it is widely believed that Bashneft\u2019s assets will eventually find their way to Sechin and become part of Rosneft. Rosneft had asked the government for a $40 billion bailout to help it withstand Western sanctions; handing it cheap assets is certainly one way to help.In imposing the sanctions, the Obama administration and its counterparts in Europe have targeted precisely the men and the companies that are closest to Putin. By reacting the way he has, Putin is scaring away not just foreign investors but Russian businessmen as well. Not that he seems to care.Thus, in the face of sanctions, does Russia cut off its nose to spite its face.An earlier version of this column incorrectly described the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. His 10-year imprisonment took place in the Russian prison system, not a Soviet penal colony. Khodorkovsky spent time in several prisons in Russia; the Soviet Union broke up in 1991.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Plans Next Phase as End to Stimulus Program Is Expected", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s the end of Q.E., and financial markets feel fine.The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce on Wednesday the end of its latest bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, or Q.E. Fed officials say the purchases served to strengthen job growth, and the economic recovery no longer needs quite so much of the central bank\u2019s support.\u201cThe exit protocol has been so well documented for the last nine months that the market has fully priced it in,\u201d said Barbara J. Cummings, who manages a $3.5 billion fixed-income portfolio for Boston Private Wealth Management. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate any movement. I feel as though this is one meeting where they almost don\u2019t need to hold it because they have made it perfectly clear.\u201dThe decision, expected at the end of a two-day meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, would cap a six-year period during which the central bank has expanded its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to almost $4.5 trillion, from less than $1 trillion in mid-2008.The Fed next plans to enter a holding pattern, a final phase in which it will maintain the size of the bond portfolio and keep short-term interest rates near zero, until officials decide that the economy no longer needs the help.For more than a year, a majority of Fed officials have pointed steadily to the middle of 2015 as the most likely time for a rate increase. Some officials want the Fed to explain more clearly how it will decide when the time has come. Others, however, are concerned that changes in the statement will be interpreted prematurely as evidence that the Fed is pulling back.Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust, said he expected the Fed to wait at least until its next meeting, in December, before providing more guidance about its plans for interest rates. \u201cI\u2019ll go way out on a limb and suggest that there will be no outward change in monetary policy,\u201d he said.Mr. Tannenbaum added that he hoped the Fed would emulate the clarity of its retreat from bond-buying as it moved toward raising interest rates. \u201cI do think this has been a success story,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that when the time comes to raise interest rates that they\u2019ll do an equally clear job of foreshadowing that.\u201dJust a few months ago, a growing number of Fed officials were expressing concern that the central bank might need to start raising rates in the spring. But inflation has remained persistently sluggish. Most Fed officials predicted in September that in the next two years, inflation would not reach the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as most beneficial for the economy. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said this month that he saw a greater chance that the first increase would be delayed.Asset prices continue to reflect even greater pessimism among many investors. This is partly a distortion caused by the high demand for Treasuries as worried investors move money from Europe to the United States. But some analysts say it also reflects a widespread view among investors that the Fed is once again overestimating the economic recovery.Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said he did not expect much of a reaction from financial markets even if the Fed suggested on Wednesday that its economic outlook had improved.\u201cIf the Fed turns hawkish tomorrow the market will likely think that Fed hikes are premature because there are still no signs of inflation, and this would also push yields down,\u201d Mr. Slok wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. \u201cIt will take more time for the market to shake off the bearish narrative that has been so widespread among fixed income investors over the past six years.\u201dMs. Cummings said it was more likely that the Fed was wrong.\u201cI do think they\u2019re overly optimistic,\u201d she said. \u201cThe market and the Fed are definitely saying two different things. And the market is right. It usually is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Asia\u2019s Gays, Taiwan Stands Out as Beacon ", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the 13th year in a row, the gay pride march took over the streets of the capital on Saturday in a boisterous, freewheeling demonstration of how far Taiwan has come in the two decades since multiparty democracy replaced martial law and authoritarian rule.But the loudest applause rose when a Malaysian flag or a troupe of Japanese dancers in traditional folk outfits, envoys from more restrictive locales, were spotted amid the throng. Carrying a handmade placard from Beijing\u2019s gay and lesbian community center above his head, James Yang could barely advance along the parade route because so many strangers wanted to be photographed by his side.\u201cI\u2019ve been to gay pride marches in New York, San Diego and Los Angeles, but this is so emotional for me,\u201d said Mr. Yang, 39, the center\u2019s director of development. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting, but at the same time, the outpouring of support reminds me of how far behind we are in China.\u201dAt a time when laws legalizing same-sex marriage are sweeping the United States, Latin America and Europe, gay rights advocates across Asia are still struggling to secure basic protections.Brunei has instituted strict Shariah laws that criminalize gay relationships, conservative legislators in the Indonesian province of Aceh passed an ordinance last month punishing gay sex with 100 lashes, and on Wednesday the highest court in Singapore upheld a law that carries a two-year jail term for men who engage in any act of \u201cgross indecency,\u201d in public or private. In one Malaysian state, effeminate boys are shipped off to boot camp in an effort to reshape their behavior.When it comes to gay rights in Asia, Taiwan is a world apart. Openly gay and lesbian soldiers can serve in the military, and the Ministry of Education requires textbooks to promote tolerance for gays and lesbians. In recent years, legislators here have passed protections for gays, including a law against workplace discrimination.A bill to legalize same-sex marriage has been introduced in Taiwan\u2019s legislature, although it still faces strong opposition from Christian activists and their allies in the governing Kuomintang.\u201cTaiwan is an inspiration for much of Asia,\u201d said Grace Poore, director of Asia and Pacific island programs at the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. \u201cThey are way ahead of their neighbors.\u201dWith its lively news media, panoply of grass-roots organizations and a robust, if sometimes noisy, democracy, this self-governing island has become a beacon for liberal political activism across Asia. Taiwan\u2019s environmental movement has emerged as a formidable electoral force, and in April, opponents of atomic energy succeeded in halting construction of the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant, although a final decision on the facility may be put to a public referendum.Democracy advocates who have occupied the streets of Hong Kong for over a month studied the tactics of the student protesters in Taiwan who earlier this year took over the Legislative Yuan in an effort to halt a trade pact they said would leave Taiwan vulnerable to pressure from mainland China, which considers the island part of its territory.\u201cWe may have a small population, but our influence is bigger than our size,\u201d said Yu Meinu, a legislator from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. \u201cThe level of free speech is unlike anywhere else.\u201dMs. Yu, who introduced the island\u2019s first marriage equality bill into the legislature two years ago, said one of Taiwan\u2019s greatest assets was its thriving collection of civil society groups. \u201cA lot of the calls for reform come from the bottom up, not from the government,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when people here see injustice, they are not afraid to stand up and make their voices heard.\u201dBut the wellspring of opposition to same-sex marriage has highlighted the limits of liberal activism. Last December, at the same spot where gay and lesbian marchers gathered over the weekend, an estimated 150,000 people rallied against the legislation.Min Daixi, vice president of the Unification Church and a leader in the Taiwan Family Protection Alliance, said same-sex unions were a threat to traditional families. \u201cThey are trying to redefine a concept that our society was built upon,\u201d he said.Victoria Hsu, who heads the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights, acknowledged that the movement for same-sex marriage faced strong opposition.But she said she was encouraged that the three leading candidates for Taipei mayor \u2014 a job on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of every president since 1988 \u2014 have all expressed support for same-sex marriage, which to her suggests that the legalization of same-sex unions is simply a matter of time. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of if, but of when,\u201d she said. Several polls over the past year have found that more than 50 percent of people in Taiwan support same-sex marriage.Religious life here, for the most part, is dominated by Buddhism and Taoism, faiths with little doctrinal resistance to homosexuality. Although they make up less than 5 percent of Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people, Christians have formed the bulwark of the opposition. \u201cTaiwanese are really tolerant,\u201d said Ms. Poore of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of place where gays and lesbians have to worry about violence if they are affectionate in public.\u201dIn addition to scores of bars, clubs and gay bookstores, one well-trod tourist attraction is a Taoist shrine dedicated to a rabbit deity \u2014 based on an 18th-century Qing dynasty official who was said to be gay \u2014 who has become something of a patron saint to gay worshipers seeking good fortune.Still, in many respects, Taiwan remains a traditional society bound by a sense of Confucian filial duty that emphasizes family and the production of heirs. Edgar Chang, 34, a chemical engineer who was wearing a rhinestone-encrusted tiara and feather boa on Saturday, said he is out to his friends but has not summoned the courage to tell his parents he has had a boyfriend for the past three years. \u201cI don\u2019t think they would disown me, but at the same time, I think it might kill them because they really want a grandchild,\u201d he said.The gay pride march has come a long way since 2003, when some participants wore masks to conceal their identities. Albert Yang, 37, one of the parade organizers, recalled his trepidation that year as the march set off with just a handful of participants. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t dare join, but they slowly worked their way into the crowd, and by the time we finished, there were 600 or 700 people,\u201d he said.This year, more than 65,000 people joined the march, according to organizers. They included contingents of Filipinos, Malaysians, Singaporeans, and a much smaller number of mainland Chinese, most of whom are restricted from traveling to Taiwan on their own by strict visa requirements imposed by both governments.Although the Chinese Communist Party takes a mostly hands-off approach to homosexual activity, there are no legal protections for gays in China, and the authorities have become less tolerant of AIDS organizations and gay rights advocates as part of a wider campaign against nongovernmental organizations.Waving a large rainbow flag over the crowd, Hiro, a 48-year-old television station employee from Tokyo, said it was his eighth time at the parade. \u201cFor gay Japanese, this is the event of the year,\u201d he said, declining to give his full name out of concern it could cause problems at work. \u201cI only wish we were as brave as the Taiwanese and could do something like this in Japan.\u201dSurveying the march from the sidelines, Jay Lin, 46, said he thought Taiwan could do more to promote its live-and-let-live ethos at a time when the island\u2019s economy is slowing. \u201cWe have become a beacon for human rights issues across Asia,\u201d said Mr. Lin, who this year started Taiwan\u2019s first gay and lesbian film festival. \u201cThis is a strong selling point, and if the government was smart, they would recognize that this is our soft power and market it to the rest of the world.\u201dChen Jiehao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Emerging-Market Bonds, Political Risk Is a Constant", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWHEN Argentina defaulted on its sovereign debt in July, investors seemed to shrug. Money kept flowing into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that invest in emerging-market bonds, as it has for much of the last five years. Indeed, many investors have been making room in their portfolios for this asset class. They\u2019ve piled into emerging-market bonds from a variety of countries, as new investment darlings like Mexico and Indonesia have overshadowed Argentina. For the last several years, emerging-market bond mutual funds and E.T.F.s have offered better returns than developed-world debt. The emerging-market bond funds tracked by Morningstar returned an annualized average of 6.3 percent in the five years ended on Sept. 30, compared with an annualized average of 4.1 percent for the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. It\u2019s important to recognize that those higher returns come with higher risks. \u201cIt\u2019s like somebody trying to get a mortgage with a lower credit score,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said. \u201cThey may be able to get a loan, but the bank will charge them a higher rate.\u201d Emerging markets often have upheavals of a sort that developed countries rarely experience. There was Argentina\u2019s failure to pay interest on its bonds this summer. And that may have been a minor event compared with Russia\u2019s clashes with Ukraine, the warfare in the Middle East and the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa. And last year brought turmoil of a different sort: the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d in financial markets, as prices for emerging-market bonds sagged on news that the Federal Reserve might begin to raise interest rates in the United States. The long debate about the benefits of active versus passive portfolio management crackles in this sector, as in every corner in the investment business. Even so, he said, the average active fund has not beaten the market averages lately. Only 13 percent of actively managed emerging-market bond funds bested the Barclays Emerging Markets USD Aggregate bond index for the three years ended on June 30. \u201cIt got better at five years \u2014 36 percent,\u201d he said. Still, some long-tenured active managers in the sector manage not only to top their benchmarks but also to do so without undue risk, according to some metrics. HOW much of a portfolio should be allocated to emerging-market bonds? It depends on whom you ask, and on your risk tolerance.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be up all night checking the latest movement of troops in the Ukraine, the right amount is nothing,\u201d Mr. Carlson said. For a less skittish investor with an investment horizon of at least three years, 6 percent to 10 percent of a total portfolio could make sense, he said. Karin S. Anderson, a senior analyst at Morningstar, says that if investors hold emerging bonds at all, the bonds should supplement, not replace, core holdings like Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds. \u201cYou should keep them in the supporting-player role \u2014 a satellite bucket in your portfolio,\u201d she said. And investors should study a fund before jumping in, she said. Within the broad category of emerging-market bonds, managers can emphasize securities with varying levels of risk. Among the options are sovereign bonds denominated in dollars, sovereigns denominated in local currencies and emerging-market corporate bonds, typically denominated in dollars. An index fund or E.T.F. might own only one type of bond, but active managers will often juggle all three and might stash a little money in cash and stocks, and hedge currency risk with derivatives. Another caveat is that many funds have short records. \u201cAbout half of the emerging-market debt funds sold in the U.S. are less than three years old,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. An investor might not be able to see how a fund held up in 2008, when the average emerging-market bond fund lost 17.6 percent. \u201cThese do tend to be the most volatile of the bond funds,\u201d she added.

{"Headline": "Costly, Yet Also Frugal", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe BMW i8\u2019s arresting style and NASA-launch speed make it easy to overlook its other selling points: fuel economy and reduced emissions.As with other plug-in hybrids, the BMW\u2019s ability to drive in multiple modes \u2014 all-electric, hybrid or power-maxing Sport \u2014 can make it hard to precisely figure its real-world efficiency: It all depends on how you\u2019re using it.By the reckoning of the Environmental Protection Agency, the i8 achieves 76 m.p.g.e. \u2014 a calculation of the energy equivalent of gasoline when the car is running on electricity alone. But with the government estimating the all-electric range at a conservative 14 miles, only a driver who makes short hops and plugs in often will see anything close to that figure. More realistically, the i8 is intended to blend gasoline and electric power to drive like a sports car, with added economy as a bonus.Even by that measure, the results are impressive: The four-seat car\u2019s combined city-highway rating of 28 m.p.g. is 40 percent better than that of the smaller two-seat Corvette Stingray (20 m.p.g.) and nearly double the combined 15 m.p.g. rating for the similar-size Aston Martin DB9.Yet the Aston Martin, even with its guzzling 510-horsepower V12 engine, cannot match the acceleration of the vastly lighter, more efficient i8, which has a \u201cmere\u201d 357 horsepower.Based on some early reviews, it\u2019s clear that drivers are popping the i8 into its least-efficient Sport mode, having a ball and calling it a day. It\u2019s hard to blame them.Yet in the interest of enlightenment, I dialed up the energy-saving Comfort/Eco Pro mode and lightened my right foot. Over one 70-mile highway stretch, the i8 managed 38 m.p.g. Average in the all-electric battery miles I used up earlier, and the i8 got 44.7 m.p.g. over 85 miles.Yes, other economy-minded gasoline, hybrid or diesel cars can match or beat those numbers. But the i8 also rips from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. in 3.8 seconds, on par with a Porsche 911.The Comfort setting on the console reduces thirst by shutting down the rear 3-cylinder engine as much as possible, in favor of the 129-horse electric motor that drives the front wheels exclusively. Eco Pro saves more fuel by operating the climate-control system more efficiently.Over more than 200 miles of city and highway driving, including slogs through Manhattan, the i8 delivered 31 m.p.g. A Corvette or 911 would return some 18 to 20 m.p.g. in the same conditions, and many megapowered sports cars do worse.Even driving the i8 as if I stole it, I never managed to knock the fuel economy below 22 m.p.g.My biggest complaint about the i8 is that the Sport and Comfort modes are essentially either-or propositions. In Sport, the gasoline engine is always on, even when one might want it to take a breather. And in Comfort mode, a driver is denied racier settings for the steering, suspension and throttle, or any display of the digital tachometer, replaced by an efficiency gauge.Henrik Wenders, the i8\u2019s program manager, said that engineers originally programmed the i8 with nine driving modes, including ones that allowed drivers to mix-and-match sporty and efficient settings. But in the interest of simplicity, the production car was limited to five modes.I suspect that many buyers won\u2019t be spending $136,650 to save on gasoline. Yet the fuel-saving technology is integral to the BMW\u2019s appeal. Take that technology away, and the i8 becomes just another spendthrift exotic car. Bake it in, and early adopters have a great, green excuse to buy a six-figure BMW.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkish Reforms Entangle Education", "Date": "2014-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationISTANBUL \u2014 The term \u201cNew Turkey,\u201d meticulously coined and methodically delivered by the government to penetrate the public psyche, and reiterated during the campaign for Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s bid for the presidency, continues to reverberate long after he has won.The slogan encompasses a series of political, economic and social reforms aimed at creating a dominant and conservative Turkey, and promoting the emergence of a religious lower and middle class. Following a restructuring of its institutions, Turkey\u2019s secular image has come under scrutiny. Secularism in schools has been undergoing a transformation that signals a reticence on the part of the ruling Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., to separate religion from politics.According to a report by the Education Reform Initiative, or E.R.I., a nongovernmental education think tank in Istanbul, there has been a 73 percent increase in the number of religious vocational schools, known as imam-hatip, in the country since 2010. While the schools offer a general academic curriculum, they also provide compulsory Islamic teaching, principally Sunni, which represents the majority of the country\u2019s 77 million population.More than 16 million students began the school year in September. As a result of a new placement policy, nearly 40,000 of them, including some non-Muslims, found themselves automatically assigned to religious vocational schools, often against their will. Many parents have demanded transfers, a difficult bureaucratic task on several counts, but mainly because of a lack of vacancies. Some critics argue that this reflects a deliberate assimilation project aimed at nationwide Sunni indoctrination.\u201cEducation is a strong tool to control or to drive demands,\u201d said the director of E.R.I., Batuhan Aydagul. \u201cIf you narrow down the supply of education on one level and expand imam-hatip-type schools on the other, there is a risk of creating circumstances where children can\u2019t easily find placement in a regular school. They find themselves \u2014 not necessarily out of choice but out of obligation \u2014 in an imam-hatip. We are concerned that there is reverse discrimination.\u201d A few years ago Mr. Erdogan, then prime minister, publicly reminisced on how he had felt discriminated against for attending such a school. Turkey used to strictly monitor religion then, with the purpose of protecting the secular view of democracy promoted by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey. But in 2012 Mr. Erdogan overtly expressed a wish to \u201craise a religious youth,\u201d signaling a reversal of the trend.\u201cTurkish education has been dominated by a militaristic state focus for a long time. There was much need for democratization in the system, and there has been some progress since the A.K.P. came to power,\u201d Mr. Aydagul said. \u201cThe challenge is that these democracy reforms are not for all but are aimed at a specific few. We expect the government to think about all the ethnic and religious groups in a pluralistic way. It\u2019s not just what the majority wants; it\u2019s also about what the minority wants.\u201dThe European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that Turkey had violated the rights of its minorities because its mandatory religious and ethics classes were based on Sunni Islam and did not take into account other religions.Many universities in Turkey now have mosques on their campuses. In Tunceli, an eastern province with a large Kurdish population, the main religion is Alevism, a branch of Islam not officially recognized by the government though it is practiced by 10 to 15 million people in Turkey. Last month, Tunceli University announced plans for a mosque and an Alevi house of worship, or cemevi, on its premises, to be financed by the Directorate of Religious Affairs, which is affiliated with the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201cWe\u2019re predominantly Alevi here, and we already have a place of worship. This cemevi plan is just window dressing. Their ultimate goal is to plant a mosque here,\u201d said Sibel Tas, a 34-year-old high school teacher in Tunceli. \u201cThe community has urgent needs. Some students had to withdraw from enrollment due to lack of accommodation.\u201d\u201cThese dynamic youths are being molded into average yes-men rather than critical thinkers,\u201d she added.Muslims make up more than 90 percent of the country, but society is growing increasingly polarized. A change in the dress code last month stirred up controversy by allowing girls, starting around age 10, to wear head scarves at school. \u201cYou enjoy the right to wear the head scarf or not, but nothing states you must,\u201d said Nurullah Genc, an academic with close ties to the government.Religious symbolism in public institutions has been carefully watched throughout Modern Turkish history. The A.K.P. has challenged this, saying it goes against individual freedom. \u201cIt is a matter of choice. It is freedom,\u201d said Mr. Genc, referring to the head scarf law.But in the 12 years since the A.K.P. came to power, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of the media have come under mounting pressure.Asked whether the state-sponsored schools served as a bulwark against religious radicalization or a breeding ground for it, Mr. Genc said, \u201cI am an imam-hatip graduate. These schools play a significant role in the building of a healthy state and nation. Where in Turkey has an imam-hatip alumni been a murderer, a thief, thrown a Molotov cocktail, founded an underground organization, become a terrorist or a drug addict? The number is low, close to none, when compared to other educational systems.\u201dBut Mr. Aydagul expressed concern over the future of Turkey\u2019s education system. \u201cTurkey needs active citizens who are democratically empowered, competent in the basic skills needed in today\u2019s society and economy,\u201d said Mr. Aydagul. \u201cAny failure to provide this through education would jeopardize the well being of the country. Today access to quality education depends on socioeconomic background, and for a country that has glorious and ambitious aims, this situation should be worrying.\u201dAdvertisement"}

More consistent?With the economy still not fully recovered from the recession brought on by that crisis, those arguments can seem as raw and relevant today as they were in 2008.This week, A.I.G. shareholders went to court to argue that the Federal Reserve\u2019s bailout of the company was an illegal taking of private property; the three chief engineers of the bailout are to testify next week.How should the new legal proceedings and press reports shape our perception of this crucial time? Here are some key questions, and my best guesses at the answers based on my years of reporting and my reading of a range of journalistic accounts, memoirs of those involved, and internal documents released through litigation.Here\u2019s an attempt to reconcile these seemingly contradictory versions:By the weekend of Sept. 13, 2008, there was bailout fatigue. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been taken over by the government a week earlier; Bear Stearns was rescued a few months before that. There was a \u201cno more bailouts\u201d consensus in the Bush administration and in both parties in Congress. Going into the weekend when Lehman Brothers failed, Mr. Paulson pre-emptively leaked to the press that there would be no bailout (this was first reported in Andrew Ross Sorkin\u2019s book \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d and confirmed in Mr. Paulson\u2019s memoir).The mind-set was \u201cwe have to draw the line somewhere, and that somewhere is here.\u201d Against that backdrop, one can imagine that Mr. Geithner, once it became clear there was no private sector rescue of Lehman in the offing, turned his attention to containing the damage of a bankruptcy.It remains true that the key policy makers never had a clear-cut plan for how to rescue Lehman. But they didn\u2019t have one because they didn\u2019t seek one.This is of course unknowable, but there\u2019s plenty of reason to think that even if Lehman Brothers had been rescued, sooner or later the crisis was going to spread to a firm too big or too broke to do anything about, particularly in the absence of the bank bailout legislation that didn\u2019t pass until early October \u2014 and only after the Lehman failure prompted big enough drops in the stock market to get Congress\u2019s attention.In other words, even had Lehman been saved, the crisis would have come to a head with A.I.G. a few days later, or Morgan Stanley a few days after that, or Wachovia or Citigroup. Would one of those results have been better or worse than what actually happened? That\u2019s the part that is anybody\u2019s guess.A.I.G., besides being a giant company that insured everything from homeowners\u2019 policies to jumbo jets, owed billions to major global banks from its ill-conceived business guaranteeing the value of highly rated securities backed by mortgages.But the policy makers\u2019 answer is also becoming clear: To demand haircuts from the banks would have defeated the point. The entire goal of the bailout was to avoid a default and the unpredictable ripple effects it would create. Yet to get the banks to agree to haircuts, they would need to threaten the very thing they were looking to avoid \u2014 to send one of the world\u2019s largest insurance companies into the same kind of disorderly bankruptcy that had already enveloped Lehman Brothers.To the policy makers involved, the decisions seemed methodical and grounded in the unique circumstances of each firm involved and their legal authorities. Is it a bank? Is it solvent? Is it systemically important?But the policy makers were reluctant to lay out in advance some framework of what institutions would be rescued and which weren\u2019t, viewing strategic ambiguity as their friend. They didn\u2019t want to pre-commit. That added to the uncertainty of a difficult time, and with hindsight some clearer sense of the rules of the game when the financial system is under stress might make the consequences less severe.The Great Depression was 80 years ago, and people are still debating the causes and response. Perhaps the 2008 crisis is destined to be the same. To the question we began with \u2014 were the financial leaders heroes, benefactors of Wall Street or vindictive decision-makers, the answer that is coming into focus is this: all three.Advertisement"}

With global supply and demand tightly matched, he said, most of the leading manufacturers were already sold out through the end of the year. \u201cModule manufacturers are healthy right now in a way that they haven\u2019t been in a while, SolarWorld included.\u201d\u201cWhat we are seeing today is a textbook case of how enforcing America\u2019s trade laws can help create family-wage manufacturing jobs,\u201d said Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon who is chairman of the finance committee and long a supporter of the trade case. \u201cThose tariffs, which are a key part of enforcing our trade laws, are now making a big difference in terms of the ability of Oregon\u2019s innovation economy to get ahead.\u201dThe expansion would add about 200 full-time jobs, Mr. Dulani of SolarWorld said, bringing the total above 900, and the company\u2019s investment in the plant to $630 million. In addition to increasing panel production, the company is expanding its production of cells, the final major components that are assembled into modules, by about 30 percent. The changes will allow the plant to produce roughly 1.89 million panels a year, up from 1.36 million panels now, a step toward the goal of eventually producing more than two million panels annually.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Brokers Court Foreign Buyers", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig DealIn the last several months, at least three brokerage firms have made announcements touting their international reach \u2014 so, it must be a trend.First, the German brokerage Engel & V\u00f6lkers announced it was opening an office in New York City; then the New York stalwart Douglas Elliman Real Estate codified a longstanding relationship with the brokerage firm Knight Frank of London, creating Douglas Elliman Fine Homes/Knight Frank Residential. And finally, a few weeks ago, Town Residential said it was opening an outpost in London and expanding relationships in places as far-flung as Brazil, Nigeria and Hong Kong. Why so much emphasis in New York on the global market? Real estate is, after all, very local. And New Yorkers have always prided themselves on uniqueness, with quirky co-op buildings, lengthy board applications and deep neighborhood identities.But over the last decade, and especially in the years since the recession, New York City real estate has undergone a significant shift. Hundreds of high-end condominiums have been built, and many of the builders no longer have, as the local cable channel NY1 News might put it, \u201creal New Yorkers\u201d in mind. Instead, it is the overseas buyer they are considering when they tout their tower\u2019s expansive views of Central Park or hotel-style concierge services. And it seems to have worked. With our ever-expanding number of foreigner-friendly buildings, New York is taking its place as a hot spot for global wealth. \u201cAll my friends already bought old townhouses in London,\u201d said Emir Bahadir, a founder of RLTY NYC in Manhattan and a fifth-generation member of a Turkish real estate family. \u201cThey want to come to New York, where you can get developments with pools inside the apartments and beautiful design \u2014 things London can\u2019t offer,\u201d said Mr. Bahadir, who ought to know, having grown up in London and at a Swiss boarding school. \u201cFor the first time, you have a full class of luxury condominiums in New York, and that product type caters to the non-New York buyer,\u201d said Stuart N. Siegel, the president of Engel & V\u00f6lkers New York Real Estate. \u201cIn the past, you might have had the Olympic Tower, or Trump Tower, but those were first-generation buildings and they were seen as a class below the classic townhouse or co-op in New York. That is no longer the case.\u201d James C. Cox Jr., a broker at Urban Compass who lived for three years in Kazakhstan, has many buyer clients from that country, once part of the Soviet bloc. \u201cWe had an early look at the Woolworth building, because I have clients interested in buying there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of dark, heavy wood and big panels of marble. It might not be appealing to local buyers since it is not as fresh and modern-looking, but for sure it is the style of my clients from the former Soviet Union.\u201d\u201cA Brazilian who has a health insurance business recently bought a $60 million apartment at One57, and we have sold a few units at the Trump SoHo just over the phone,\u201d said Cristiano Piquet, the founder of Piquet Realty, who represents many Brazilian buyers. \u201cDemand from Brazil is increasing, and we are going to see a big wave of buyers coming right after the elections in a few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are uncertain of the future there, and want to park their money in a more stable economy like the U.S.\u201d Global instability is a key driver of demand here, and while there has been an increase in supply to satisfy demand, \u201cwe are still at an absorption rate of almost half of what is considered normal in New York City,\u201d said Wendy Maitland, the president of sales at Town Residential. \u201cYes, we have more inventory, and yes, there will be certain segments of the product that won\u2019t move as quickly as sellers hope, but we are still at historic lows in terms of existing inventory and inventory coming on line.\u201d Armed with this view, Town is making an effort to push its presence overseas. \u201cWe have consciously and deliberately set about forging direct and vetted relationships with brokers in the luxury market in cities all over the globe,\u201d Ms. Maitland said. While brokerages are expanding their footprint overseas to lure foreign buyers to Manhattan and vice versa, there are, of course, some stumbling blocks. One is New York taxes. \u201cTaxes are a major problem,\u201d Mr. Cox of Urban Compass said. \u201cWe help buyers structure limited liability companies to avoid, or minimize, some taxes, but it is often a challenge to explain all the different taxes they are charged.\u201dThese charges include transfer taxes, the mortgage recording tax and the mansion tax. \u201cWhen I have buyers from outside New York \u2014 not just overseas buyers but Americans who live in other states \u2014 they are overwhelmed by the taxes they see crossing the table at a closing,\u201d said Jeffrey S. Reich, a partner at the law firm Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz. Buyers who are borrowing more than $500,000 must pay a mortgage recording tax of 2.175 percent of the total; for properties of more than $1 million, there is an additional 1 percent mansion tax. Then there are the transfer taxes, which can total close to 2 percent of the purchase price, and are supposedly the responsibility of the seller, but in a market like the current one, are often paid by the buyer. \u201cIt ends up that you can pay over 5 percent in taxes just for the benefit of being able to invest your money in New York City,\u201d Mr. Reich said. In recent weeks, an idea has been floated of also charging a so-called pied-\u00e0-terre tax for part-time residents who buy expensive properties. Under one proposal, the owner of a unit valued at between $5 million and $6 million would pay 0.5 percent of the amount over the $5 million threshold. This would gradually increase, capping off at properties of more than $25 million, where the owner would pay a $370,000 fee plus 4 percent of the amount over $25 million. This could have a chilling effect on the market. \u201cMy clients compare New York with Florida,\u201d Mr. Piquet said of his Brazilian clientele, \u201cand if Florida has much lower taxes, that could be a deciding factor for them to buy there instead.\u201d New York, of course, is not the only city popular with global buyers that charges high taxes. In London, for instance, a buyer of a new $3 million property would pay nearly 8 percent of the value in taxes and fees, while in Hong Kong, that number can rise to as much as 25 percent, according to Liam Bailey, the global head of research at Knight Frank. London, like New York, is also bracing for the possibility of an additional tax next year, with a proposal to charge a mansion tax on properties valued at more than 2 million pounds, Mr. Bailey said. In London, and increasingly in New York, there is a feeling that wealthy foreign buyers are driving up the price of real estate for locals. There is also a fear that so many part-time residents will create ghostly avenues of tall towers that stand mostly dark and vacant in the night sky.The jury is still out, and the luxury market fueled by foreign wealth could wane. Still, half the buyers of properties priced above 2 million pounds in Central London are foreign nationals, Mr. Bailey said; they show no sign of leaving anytime soon. If the trend continues apace, New York might soon be able to make a similar claim. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany Without Angst? That Worries Me.", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 I\u2019m starting to worry about the endless flow of good news from Germany.So why am I anxious? Because what we Germans have done so far was to correct mistakes from the past. What we don\u2019t have, I fear, is a plan for the future. I\u2019m talking not only about finances. In general, mentally, I find my country to be in a dangerous state of stagnation.Yes, we Germans may have deserved to rest on our laurels for a little. It wasn\u2019t easy getting here. The welfare cuts made by Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der in the mid-2000s were harsh, and because of wage restraint to rein in inflation, most employees today settle for smaller real incomes compared with 15 years ago. And we have saved enormously: The average German saves about 10 percent of his income; more than double the American rate. Most of my compatriots take pride in this, as an expression of our self-discipline.Yet this self-discipline has also made us complacent. In his much-discussed new book, \u201cThe Germany Illusion,\u201d the economist Marcel Fratzscher issues a stark wake-up call: \u201cThis country is on a downward track and is living today from its substance.\u201d Our obsession with saving means we\u2019re not spending where we need to. Back in the 1990s, he recalls, Germany invested 23 percent of its gross domestic product. Today, with only 17 percent, it has dropped below the rate of other comparable countries. Mr. Fratzscher singles out infrastructure and education as particularly scary examples of the German \u201cinvestment gap.\u201dIt\u2019s not as if our autobahns and schools are falling apart just yet. At the same time, no one appears particularly eager to improve what we have. Angela Merkel is a prudent chancellor, but her prudence includes one big promise: Nothing will change. Yes, she ordered a major national project, to switch Germany\u2019s energy supply from nuclear to renewables \u2014 but this decision wasn\u2019t born out of a progressive vision, but the shock of the Fukushima catastrophe.Whenever I travel between Hamburg and Berlin, Germany\u2019s two biggest cities, a big sticker on the high-speed train now informs me that it is running on \u201c100 percent green energy.\u201d Yet as soon as the train pulls away from Hamburg, my cellphone connection gets shaky, or breaks down completely.Much worse is that there still isn\u2019t free Wi-Fi on board \u2014 a stinging anachronism in a region where most countries, like the Netherlands and Finland, offer it as a matter of course. It is small example, but it is symbolic. Where is the can-do spirit in the country that\u2019s being hailed as Europe\u2019s powerhouse?And for all the effort it took to get to a zero-debt budget, that achievement hides another flaw. I am afraid Germany, after the era of neoliberalism, might be falling for another Zeitgeist: the sinfulness of making debt. Of course, there are good reasons to remain rigid. Excessive public spending was a root cause of the euro crisis, and Berlin, as Europe\u2019s leading economy, feels obliged to give the best example of balancing budgets. In this endeavor, however, the difference between ineffective waste and profitable investment is too easily ignored.It\u2019s true that there are also deep cultural reasons for the German reluctance to avoid debts and deficits. The 1920s and \u201930s are long behind us, but the fear that debt and inflation will lead to ruin is not. And this fear is not just on the collective, national scale.Take housing. Less than 50 percent of Germans choose to buy property, the lowest rate among the 28 countries in the European Union. When I ask my property-shunning friends why, most say they don\u2019t want to buy something so large on credit, even if the alternative means paying a monthly rent that gives no return at all. The stain of debt holds even at the linguistic level. The German language, as far as I know, is the only one in the world in which the words for debt and guilt are etymologically the same \u2014 the word for debt is \u201cSchulden,\u201d and for guilt it\u2019s \u201cSchuld.\u201dAnd there appears to be another reason for our current drift: In historical terms, Germany has entered a comfort zone. We ended up here thanks to two simultaneous developments. The first is the experience of becoming Europe\u2019s indispensable nation, both politically and economically. The second is the growing biographical distance from a history that demanded remorse, reparation and proof of tenacity.For the first time in their lives, the current generation of German leaders doesn\u2019t have to struggle for international approval; instead they struggle not to be bothered by too many wishes from abroad. European unification is more or less complete, we\u2019ve offered billions in loan guarantees to the eurozone, and we have even won the World Cup. Time to lean back!While we do so, economic growth in Germany is slowing to zero. Exports are sinking and unemployment is slightly rising. In this situation you\u2019d wish for a chancellor to spur the Germans to set themselves new, promising aims. Angela Merkel isn\u2019t that leader. We are not wasting money here. Much worse. We are wasting time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Importance of Investing in Asia\u2019s Infrastructure", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal TrendsBut the reason for the cautious part, which I imagine the APEC finance ministers will focus on, is uncertainty about the recovery in rich countries. Europe is not doing particularly well. Japan seems to have stalled for the moment. We expect that it will change as Japan and Europe will grow slightly in 2015, but nothing stellar either.On the spending side, you see countries like Indonesia and Malaysia that still have significant subsidies, like fuel subsidies, that really don\u2019t go to poor people, and this would be a good time to change this. To be fair, Indonesia did some subsidy reforms a couple of years ago, but they need to do more. Same for Malaysia. Meanwhile the Philippines and Vietnam need to do more on the revenue side. They need to figure out how they can improve tax administration and rationalize their tax structure in order to increase revenues, so they can undertake additional priority spending, particularly on infrastructure.One of the messages of our report is that governments in the region need to look at their spending patterns, and that\u2019s where the subsidies issue comes in. In Indonesia, fuel subsidies represent 3.5 percent of G.D.P., and if these subsidies are not well targeted, that\u2019s 3.5 percent you could be using somewhere else. In other countries, approving public projects is so complicated it takes years to implement. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Big Box Vacation", "Date": "2014-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayAmid the three-pound tubs of peanut butter, the 36-roll packs of toilet paper and the discounted Calvin Klein underwear is a large poster of a beach, a palm tree and a question: \u201cWish you were here?\u201d The poster is positioned beside the checkout lines at a Costco warehouse in Rego Park, Queens, where it\u2019s conceivable that one might find herself wishing she were on a deserted island.Such dreams are meant to become realities on Costco\u2019s website, where club members can book discounted vacation packages, cruises and rental cars. But just how compelling are the deals? And what about the travel offerings from other big box chains like Sam\u2019s Club and BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club?That said, there are deals to be had. I searched the sites for a hotel and flight package to Canc\u00fan, Mexico from New York City for seven nights in November for two adults and a 3-year-old child. On each site I chose the JW Marriott Canc\u00fan Resort and Spa, and nonstop economy-class flights.On CostcoTravel.com, airfare, airport transfers and an ocean-view room with a balcony was $2,996.61 \u2014 including a $50 daily resort credit and a $75 spa credit to boot. The flight arrived in Canc\u00fan at 10:44 p.m., not ideal for a small child. For an additional $186, however, you could arrive at 3:10 p.m. instead, making the final cost $3,182.61.Costco appears to be the most transparent big box site mainly because when booking a room you do so directly with the hotel \u2014 so resort fees are clearly displayed. With BJ\u2019s, as with many travel booking sites, things are subtler. A sentence under the total says \u201cMandatory fees: collected by hotel.\u201d To learn how much they are, you have to click on a link below that says, \u201cSee details.\u201dSam\u2019s Club turns up more lodging options than Costco, including brands like Westin and Ritz-Carlton. The company also offers deals on vacation home rentals, cruises and activities, including theme parks and theater tickets. Here the Canc\u00fan package was $3,165.29 \u2014 about $17 less than Costco but hardly enough to make up for the lack of airport transfers and spa and resort credits. The BJ\u2019s package was $3,336.05, the most expensive club option. Booking directly through Marriott and American Airlines was even more costly.Still, while there were times when the big box sites had the superior package deals, there were times they did not. For instance, at Sam\u2019s Club a weeklong package at the Ritz-Carlton, Canc\u00fan (including flights) was $2,445.14. That same trip on Expedia was $1,690.85 \u2014 about $750 less than the big box deal.On BJ\u2019s there\u2019s more variety. I typed \u201cVail, Co.\u201d and up popped options from the Evergreen Lodge ($88 a night) to the Four Seasons Vail ($276 a night). Those prices were the same on Expedia. At the Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort and Spa, the alpine view king room was $354.61, plus $50 in resort fees for a total of $404.61. BJ\u2019s members who booked online could get a $20 rebate. But rebates are not as helpful as deeper price cuts. You have to front the money, fill out a form and wait for a refund. And even with a $20 rebate, the Costco price was cheaper.At Sam\u2019s Club, the least expensive room for the weekend was $269.46. Curiously, there was no mention of a resort fee. I checked with Sam\u2019s Club and as it turns out, there was a fee ($25 to $50 depending on the season, according to a customer service representative), but you would never know that by looking at the reservation page. That\u2019s frustrating, to say the least. And while that increases the total cost, it\u2019s still lower than the other club sites. Further research turned up hotel listings (like the Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua in Hawaii) in which Sam\u2019s Club did indeed show the resort fee. Lesson: If you want to be sure the price you see is what you\u2019ll pay, always ask. As for the Park Hyatt room, the Sam\u2019s Club price was a nonrefundable frugal option the other clubs didn\u2019t offer. Additionally, booking that room would earn 269 points (one for each dollar spent online) in the Sam\u2019s Club loyalty program, which could be used to pay for future hotel bookings.The Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort and Spa was also listed on Expedia and Hotels.com, where a nonrefundable room could be had for the weekend for $382.40 (including resort fees) \u2014 more costly than all but one of the big box stores. Again, the lesson is: Shop around. Don\u2019t assume your particular club\u2019s rate is always the best. Sometimes it\u2019s a travel booking site, or the hotel\u2019s own website.The cheapest rental was on BJ\u2019s: A standard car from Payless Car Rental was about $164 for the week. The most expensive was Sam\u2019s Club, where standard cars started at $245.64 (including taxes and fees) from Alamo. Costco fell in between at $224.56 (including taxes and fees) for an Alamo rental. The price also included a one-car-class upgrade. (Note that Costco also has online rental car coupons, like $30 off an already discounted five-day Avis rental.)Boris KulikovAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Merkel Wait, Finding Time for Truffles ", "Date": "2014-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILAN \u2014 He was at it again this week.Nor was Mr. Putin done. When he left Ms. Merkel at roughly 2 a.m. Friday, his entourage streaked through Milan to the home of his friend and Italy\u2019s former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. The men talked and enjoyed truffles until about 4 a.m., whereupon Mr. Putin departed, leaving him barely four hours before he joined European leaders, including Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, for a pivotal breakfast meeting.\u201cHe loves you and me and everybody else looking at him and trying to figure him out,\u201d said Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York and the great-granddaughter of Nikita S. Khrushchev. \u201cHe\u2019s an exhibitionist.\u201d She added, \u201cHe pushes the envelope all the time, and he gets away with it.\u201dIf European leaders were expecting him to be humbled, they had another thing coming. Not only did he exude his usual confidence, but Mr. Putin even told an off-color joke about the anatomical difference between a grandpa and a grandma at a late afternoon news conference.After the breakfast meeting, Ms. Merkel and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain expressed frustration, as Mr. Putin apparently rebuffed their entreaties that he pressure pro-Russian rebels to put off local elections they have scheduled for November in defiance of the Ukrainian government, which has set nationwide local elections for Dec. 7.To Mr. Cameron, Mr. Putin had not yet budged, or budged enough, on any of the contested issues. \u201cAnd if those things don\u2019t happen, then clearly the European Union, Britain included, must keep in place the sanctions and the pressure so that we don\u2019t have this kind of conflict in our continent,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. (Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, countered by telling Russian reporters in Milan that some European leaders were obstinate and had refused to take an \u201cobjective approach.\u201d)\u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018Waiting for Godot\u2019 quality to Western analysis,\u201d said Matthew Rojansky, a Russia expert at the Kennan Institute, a research organization in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s always waiting for Putin to blink, to be cowed or shamed or humbled.\u201dMr. Rojansky continued: \u201cHe stands for Russian resurgence. Ask yourself: When was Peter the Great humble? When was Catherine humble? That\u2019s not part of the role that they play.\u201dIf Mr. Putin is easy to caricature, with his macho photo ops, posing shirtless in the Russian wilderness, for instance, his style underpins a method. Even with Russia\u2019s economy steadily grinding downward, with a recession looming and the ruble hitting new lows almost daily, Mr. Putin is wildly popular at home, using the state press to stir up a nationalistic fervor that has sown unease in the West, but that has created broad public support for his Ukraine policies within Russia.Just as he introduced his peace plan on a napkin last month, Mr. Putin set the stage for Milan with a visit on Sunday to Sochi, home of the recent Winter Olympics. There, he was watching the final laps of Russia\u2019s first Formula One Grand Prix, the second of three major sporting events that Mr. Putin has personally helped organize, when his aides abruptly announced that he had ordered an end to \u201cmilitary exercises\u201d in western Russia and was pulling back more than 17,000 troops from along the border with Ukraine.The timing was impeccable, even if Western leaders remained skeptical that the realities on the Ukrainian border had really changed.Mr. Putin has apparently calculated that European outrage over Ukraine has limits, given economic ties between Europe and Russia, as well as European dependence on Russian energy. He could, however, face a tougher reception when he travels next month to a Group of 20 summit meeting in Brisbane, Australia, a country that lost 28 citizens in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine.On Friday, the area where Mr. Putin hinted at the most wiggle room was on the gas dispute, where he said Russia was prepared to compromise, to a degree, though he pointedly noted that Russia would no longer sell gas on credit to Ukraine.Mr. Putin also understands that Europe is far from unified on sanctions and on how hard a line to take with the Kremlin. In Serbia, a country with aspirations of joining the European Union, Mr. Putin was greeted like a Roman proconsul, cheered by throngs during a military parade and awarded the Order of the Republic, Serbia\u2019s highest honor.Aware of Serbia\u2019s own diplomatic balancing act, Mr. Putin said nothing during his visit that would embarrass Serbian leaders before their European partners, restricting himself to remarks about the historic role played by the Soviet Union in defeating fascism in World War II.Yet Mr. Putin\u2019s showmanship appears to be wearing thin with Europe\u2019s leaders, particularly the most important one, Ms. Merkel. Early in the Ukraine crisis, she was seen potentially as a trusted broker, herself a child of Soviet East Germany, someone with a genuine understanding of the Russian perspective. But as Mr. Putin has repeatedly finessed or ignored commitments on Ukraine, Ms. Merkel has become increasingly antagonistic, supporting sanctions and saying recently that they could be left in place for a very long time.Mr. Putin\u2019s tardy arrival for their Thursday night meeting probably did not help. (\u201cAnd this is a woman he likes; this is a woman he actually respects,\u201d Ms. Khrushcheva said.) He came to her hotel about 11 p.m. on Thursday and remained for more than two hours. Photographs showed the two leaders seated across a table with aides. When he later arrived at Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s apartment, it was apparent that his meeting with Ms. Merkel had not gone particularly well.\u201cHe didn\u2019t say that progress was made,\u201d said Valentino Valentini, a longtime aide to Mr. Berlusconi who was present for their meeting. \u201cThe impression was that their positions were still far apart.\u201dThat Mr. Putin would make time for Mr. Berlusconi \u2014 especially at 2 a.m. \u2014 might seem odd, though the two men do have a colorful history, vacationing together and becoming close friends. \u201cEvery time Putin comes through, he comes and visits,\u201d Mr. Valentini noted.For Mr. Berlusconi, who remains a political force in Italy, if a diminished one, the meeting with Mr. Putin is a political bonus. Il Giornale, a Milan-based newspaper owned by Mr. Berlusconi, wrote that the meeting proved \u201cthe true interlocutor with the Russian president is the Cavalier,\u201d alluding to one of Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s nicknames.Mr. Valentini denied the two men had spent an evening in revelry, as has often been rumored of their past meetings. \u201cAt 2 in the morning,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it wasn\u2019t too much of a wild party.\u201dJim Yardley reported from Milan, and David.

{"Headline": "Arrest of Suspected Drug Lord in Mexico Is Seen as Symbolic Amid Police Scandal", "Date": "2014-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Vicente Carrillo Fuentes was the mediocre heir, the authorities said. He never quite gained the fame or authority of his brother, Amado Carrillo Fuentes \u2014 the Juarez cartel\u2019s late founder and the kingpin famous for both flying cocaine to the United States in jumbo jets and dying during failed plastic surgery in 1997.Instead, Vicente was vicious. Mr. Carillo Fuentes, who was arrested Thursday by Mexican authorities in the northern city of Torreon, ran the Juarez ring with an eye for killing and a thirst for allies, according to American and Mexican officials who have been pursuing him for 14 years.His was the era when the battle between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels made Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez as bloody and violent as a war zone. And yet at this point, with Juarez far more calm, experts said, his arrest was mostly symbolic.Thus the timing of his arrest has raised suspicions among some in Mexico. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is in the midst of the largest security scandal of his term, with Mexico and the world aghast at the recent discovery of a mass grave with 28 bodies near a town in the state of Guerrero, where 43 students were reported missing after a confrontation with the police in late September. At a news conference Thursday, Mexico\u2019s attorney general announced that more graves and bodies had been found in the area, and that four more people had been arrested, in addition to the 22 police officers already detained.Security analysts and former intelligence officers \u2014 along with American officials \u2014 have been arguing for months that these and other episodes clearly show that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto needs to get serious about reforming the criminal justice system and establishing more effective systems of accountability for security forces, after spending the first two years of his presidency emphasizing the improving economy.The president, though, has stopped far short of an overhaul. Responding to the case of the missing students, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto delivered a four-minute speech on Monday, in which he kept the focus relatively narrow, saying, \u201cWe need to find the truth and make sure the law is applied to those responsible for these outrageous, painful and unacceptable acts.\u201d At least in part, some experts said, the theatrics around Thursday\u2019s arrest \u2014 with Mr. Carrillo Fuentes put on display upon arrival at the airport here \u2014 seemed aimed at casting security forces in a better light. \u201cThe Mexican federal government is in desperate need of this kind of success, in order to neutralize the effects of all the attention to what happened in Guerrero,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Ben\u00edtez Manaut, a researcher at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City who studies criminal groups.And yet, he and others added, it was a legitimate success. Mr. Carrillo Fuentes has been on the run for more than a decade. \u201cThese people should not be allowed to walk free, unpunished, enjoying their drug-related money,\u201d Mr. Ben\u00edtez said. Alejandro Hope, a former intelligence official under Mexico\u2019s last president, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, added that the positive attention from an arrest dissipates too quickly \u2014 and the arrests themselves are too hard to obtain \u2014 to believe that this was simply a political ploy. If anything, he said, the arrest and its promotion \u201creinforces the sense of continuity between Calder\u00f3n and Pe\u00f1a, something the Pe\u00f1a people have been trying to run from.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Carrillo Fuentes, 51, was the second suspected kingpin captured over the last two weeks. On Oct. 1, the Mexican Army arrested H\u00e9ctor Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva, 49, who the authorities say is the head of the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva cartel. He was caught in the colonial city of San Miguel de Allende while eating dinner at a seafood restaurant. Both men were heirs to their family businesses, and in middle-age, dinosaurs of the trade. Mr. Carrillo Fuentes often used disguises and moved from city to city, authorities said. Mr. Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva had been presenting himself as a local businessman. The new generation of criminal leaders, experts note, tends to be less polished, at least as brutal, and more diffuse in their organizational structure \u2014 like the gangs that are believed to have colluded with the police in the case of the missing students. That case, many argue, is far too significant and too telling to be brushed aside by an unrelated arrest.\u201cIf the capture had happened in any other given moment, it would have had a much greater effect and impact, a much bigger political gain for Pe\u00f1a Nieto,\u201d said Jorge Chabat, a drug and security expert at CIDE, a Mexico City research group. \u201cBut it\u2019s happening at a moment where all eyes and everyone\u2019s attention is on the missing students.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Vitriol Flows as Malloy Faces Foley Again in Connecticut Governor\u2019s Race", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARTFORD \u2014 It is Connecticut\u2019s version of the Thrilla in Manila: a rematch between two of the state\u2019s heavyweights, with the top job as the prize.Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, bested Thomas C. Foley, a Republican, when the two squared off in a contest for governor in 2010, but by a margin of only half a percentage point. Four years later, the two are running against each other again, with polls showing them even, though the momentum, after several vitriolic debates, seems to be shifting in Governor Malloy\u2019s favor.Mr. Malloy, a longtime government servant, raised taxes but stabilized the state\u2019s finances and pushed forward one of the nation\u2019s toughest gun laws after the Newtown school massacre. Mr. Foley, a wealthy businessman and former ambassador to Ireland, wants to bring his entrepreneurial skills to Connecticut\u2019s still-flagging economy, yet thinks improving mental health services would have been more effective than new gun-control laws.The race, to be decided on Nov. 4, is being watched closely by national party leaders. President Obama is scheduled to campaign with Mr. Malloy on Wednesday, and other party leaders like Bill Clinton have come here. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has hoisted the flag for Mr. Foley. For Democrats, the prospect of losing a governorship in New England is worrisome, both symbolically and as a potential harbinger of the 2016 elections. Conversely, for Republicans, gaining ground in the Northeast would be a triumph. More than 40 percent of Connecticut\u2019s eligible voters are unaffiliated. In separate interviews, the two candidates emphasized their campaign themes. Mr. Foley said he would apply skills learned in the private sector to revive Connecticut\u2019s economy and improve government services, like the 53-minute waiting times at the Department of Motor Vehicles.But Mr. Malloy said Mr. Foley distorted the economically depressed state\u2019s steady economic growth of 1 percent per year during Mr. Malloy\u2019s tenure and his creation of 60,000 private sector jobs.\u201cHe will do what other Republican governors have done and that will lead to bankruptcy, or not funding pensions or layoffs of teachers and firemen,\u201d Mr. Malloy said. \u201cHe talks like a Republican and walks like a Republican and what he wants to do to Connecticut is what other Republican governors have done to other states.\u201dMr. Malloy, 59, is the youngest of eight children of a middle-class family who overcame dyslexia so bad that he could not write and relied on a keen memory to become a Brooklyn prosecutor and four-term mayor of Stamford. Also from a large family (six children), Mr. Foley, 62, attended Phillips Academy Andover and Harvard before working for Citicorp Venture Capital and then forming an investment firm that purchases companies. He also served as a development director in Iraq after the 2003 American invasion. President George W. Bush awarded him the ambassadorship to Ireland. Both candidates are receiving public financing.It has not been a dull race. In debates so far, the two have jabbed and sometimes slugged at each other in ways more fitting for the Thrilla in Manila \u2014 the 1975 rematch in the Philippines between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier \u2014 than a state that in the popular mind retains an air of patrician gentility.In campaign ads, Mr. Malloy has sought to picture Mr. Foley as a yacht-sailing Greenwich businessman who as an investor eliminated hundreds of jobs when a textile manufacturer he once owned closed a Georgia plant; Mr. Foley disputes the charge, saying he created more than 3,000 jobs. Mr. Foley has sought to portray Mr. Malloy as a wheeler-dealer who exaggerates the health of Connecticut\u2019s economy.\u201cIt\u2019s coming down to Foley\u2019s yacht versus Malloy\u2019s Pinocchio nose,\u201d said Gary L. Rose, a professor of politics at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, alluding to images in the antagonists\u2019 advertisements.That is the race\u2019s clean part. In an early debate, Mr. Foley brought up a decade-old corruption investigation. Questions had been raised about whether, when Mr. Malloy was mayor, contractors who did $505,000 worth of work on his house on Long Island Sound had received special deals from the city. Mr. Malloy was cleared of all charges.And Mr. Malloy has dredged up two episodes, one a 1981 arrest in which Mr. Foley, then 29, was accused of hitting a car five times in the Hamptons and spent the night in jail, and another in which his former wife claimed she was blocked from leaving the driveway and was then run off the road in a 1993 custody dispute. Both charges were dropped, Mr. Foley said, calling Mr. Malloy \u201cdesperate\u201d for raising the matters. According to Mr. Malloy, Mr. Foley failed to disclose the arrests to the Federal Bureau of Investigation during his ambassadorship confirmation.\u201cSomeone in a glass house shouldn\u2019t throw stones,\u201d Mr. Malloy said in their debate at the University of Connecticut at Storrs this month. \u201cI\u2019m not the person who failed to disclose to the F.B.I. that he\u2019d been arrested. I\u2019m not the person who didn\u2019t tell the full truth about the incidents involving a woman in a car that you struck five times at rates of speed going 50 miles an hour.\u201dThe election may ride on the nuances of Mr. Malloy\u2019s handling of the economy. In the interview, Mr. Malloy contended that when he came into office the state faced the nation\u2019s largest per capita deficit, at $3.3 billion. That prompted him to raise taxes by a total of $1.5 billion and negotiate $1.6 billion in public union concessions, but as a result, Mr. Malloy said, teachers and police officers have kept jobs that have enabled improvements in high school graduation rates and a decline in homicides.Given the lingering shock of the Newtown shootings, in which 20 first graders and six staff members were killed in 2012, gun control is also a major issue. Afterward, Mr. Malloy and the General Assembly, which Democrats control, banned many models of assault-style weapons and large ammunition magazines and required background checks. Mr. Foley, who is endorsed by pro-gun groups, said in the interview that he would have emphasized mental health approaches to prevent such tragedies rather than \u201ctake away rights from gun owners.\u201dSymbolism may also play a part. Mr. Foley, who owns a 116-foot yacht, a fighter jet and an imposing Greenwich mansion, did not pay federal income taxes in 2011 and 2012 by, for example, offsetting $2.8 million in capital gains with investment losses. In the interview, he defended that by pointing out that \u201cmy income comes in clumps.\u201d If the business does not make money, he said, he should not have to pay taxes.In his commercials, Mr. Malloy, who with his wife, Cathy, made about $305,000 in 2013, has chosen to contrast Mr. Foley\u2019s taxpaying record with his conspicuous wealth, hoping that the comparison makes it harder for Mr. Foley\u2019s accusations that he is a tax-happy liberal to stick.Mr. Foley rued the state\u2019s stalled economy on Tuesday during a visit to Fair Weather Acres Farm in Rocky Hill. Supporters there hailed Mr. Foley\u2019s hardened attitude toward the state\u2019s finances.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get the place business friendly, you\u2019ve got to get your finances in order,\u201d said John Miller, 84, of nearby Wethersfield. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just not happening. I think he just projects confidence that he can do it.\u201dBenjamin Mueller contributed reporting from Rocky Hill, Conn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tracing the Line in Colorado, a State Split Left and Right", "Date": "2014-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStates in PlayERIE, Colo. \u2014 To trace the border between the liberal and conservative corners of the American West, head down East County Line Road, a two-lane asphalt stripe parting the plains here in Northern Colorado.To the east lies Weld County, a conservative stronghold where 20,000 oil and gas wells pump day and night, and Republicans are so dominant that they are running unchallenged for county assessor, clerk and a commissioner\u2019s seat. Fifteen miles to the west is Boulder, where a Buddhist-inspired university offers classes in yoga and the Tibetan language, and nature activists are working to carve out legal rights for ecosystems and wild species.Straddling those divisions is Erie, a town of 21,500 whose perch along County Line Road embodies the shifting politics and demographics of a Western swing state where Republicans are waging a spirited battle to reclaim power after recent years of Democratic gains. Two prominent Democrats, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper and Senator Mark Udall, are in fierce re-election fights, and both parties are spending millions to claim a bellwether win.\u201cColorado is subjected to extremes,\u201d said Roy Romer, a former governor. \u201cIt\u2019s not just blue and red. It\u2019s also urban and rural. We have a history to this.\u201dTo some, the social and demographic changes that have shaded Colorado blue in recent elections are welcome. But Colorado\u2019s political leanings have tilted back and forth in surprising ways since it became a state in 1876, sometimes marching in lock step with Republican ranching and mining magnates, and other times bolting to support populists or so-called Silver Republicans who detested the once-dominant gold standard.\u201cThis is not a blue state,\u201d said Ted Trimpa, a lawyer and political strategist who helped to craft the Democratic rise to power in the statehouse over the past decade. \u201cThis is very much an independent state, and more and more reflects where people in the rest of the country are.\u201dThe contest between Mr. Udall and his Republican challenger, Representative Cory Gardner, a second-term congressman from far eastern Colorado, has become one of the most competitive and expensive Senate races in the country. It is a must-hold seat if Democrats have a shred of hope of retaining their Senate majority. For Republicans, it offers a long-sought chance to reclaim a marquee statewide office and show that they can once again win in a Western state that is growing more urban, Hispanic and socially liberal.The campaign has touched on energy drilling and the economy, President Obama\u2019s health care law and the size and role of government, but at its core has been a battle for the votes of women and Latinos. In 2010, Democrat Michael Bennet defied a nationwide Republican surge to win a Senate race here, in large part because Democrats hammered his Republican opponent on abortion and contraception. As for Latinos, they now represent 14 percent of Colorado\u2019s electorate and 21 percent of its population, and while many are reliably Democratic, Republicans have been going door to door to try to sway them.Democrats are pressing their advantages with both groups in campaigning against Mr. Gardner, casting him as an anti-immigrant conservative who wants to broadly outlaw abortion. Mr. Gardner does oppose abortion, but he has tried hard to soften his conservatism and appeal to the center, saying he wants to make birth control available over the counter and no longer supports a \u201cpersonhood\u201d referendum that would grant legal rights to embryos.This will also be the first major election to test Colorado\u2019s new all-mail voting system, in which ballots were sent to all registered voters three weeks before Election Day, ideally \u2014 in the eyes of those who proposed the change \u2014 increasing turnout. The new law, which will also allow people to register to vote up through Election Day, was approved by the Democratic-controlled legislature over loud Republican objections.A CliffhangerAnalysts say this may be the closest Senate race in the country, and so candidates are fanning out across the heavily Democratic neighborhoods of Denver, the deeply Republican suburbs of Douglas County and growing bedroom communities like Erie.Here, new homes (\u201cFrom the $300s!\" declare billboards) are cropping up on old pastureland, gazing out at new oil-and-gas well pads. Construction and a drilling boom have helped to pull Colorado out of the recession, pushing unemployment down to 4.7 percent and reviving tax revenue. But economists say that job growth has not kept up with the state\u2019s explosive population growth.One of Erie\u2019s largest employers, a gun-magazine manufacturer named Magpul, is leaving town out of disgust with new gun-control laws passed last year by Democrats. As many as 200 jobs are leaving for Texas and Wyoming. Joe Wilson, a former mayor and National Rifle Association member, said he was not upset with Magpul for leaving, but with politicians for tightening gun laws.\u201cIt was nuts in a down economy to have an industry ejected from the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shocked people.\u201dErie\u2019s partisan hues mirror the rest of the state. About 30 percent of voters here are Democrats and 32 percent are Republicans, but each party is outnumbered by independent voters. Residents say the town\u2019s politics and demographics are changing fast with the arrival of more people priced out of the Boulder area.\u201cEverybody\u2019s a transplant at this point,\u201d said Shawne Beeson, who moved here in September from the northern Denver suburb of Westminster, beckoned by good schools and affordable homes. He opened a computer-repair shop in a shopping plaza.\u201cI\u2019m just part of what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this place is going to become a lot more Boulder. As prices shift, they\u2019re all going to come here.\u201dAs a die-hard Democrat, Mr. Beeson said, living in a politically diverse town has required some concessions to civility. He said he listened politely when he disagreed with a customer, but admitted that he once snapped at a man who was fuming about this summer\u2019s influx of young Central American refugees.\u201cI sort of went off the rails,\u201d he said.Growth and DiversityThe last two decades brought growth and diversity in Denver and the towns that spill eastward from the Front Range of the Rockies and cluster along Colorado\u2019s two major interstates. The area is now a polyglot quilt of immigrants from East Africa, Central America and Southeast Asia. Vietnamese noodle houses line Federal Boulevard in Denver. Somali and Burmese refugees slaughter cows at the meatpacking plants outside Fort Morgan.Twenty-five years ago, Colorado\u2019s population was about two-thirds the size it is today, and much whiter and more conservative. In 1991, Focus on the Family moved its headquarters to Colorado Springs, becoming a clarion voice of Christian conservatism in the national and local culture wars.On the northeastern plains, near the Nebraska border, Mr. Gardner\u2019s hometown, Yuma, embodies a white, rural conservatism that is changing fast. It is a solidly Republican agricultural and ranching city where hunters arrive every autumn for pheasant season, and Mr. Gardner\u2019s family still runs a farm-equipment business.In the last 30 years, though, waves of once-migrant workers from Mexico\u2019s Chihuahua State have settled here, drawn by jobs picking beets and pumpkins and working in the dairies and hog-feed lots. Latinos now make up about 40 percent of Yuma\u2019s population, compared with 4 percent in 1990. Half the preschoolers and nearly half the elementary-school students in Yuma come from Spanish-speaking families, said Margo Ebersole, with the Rural Communities Resource Center.Lauro Lopez of Mexico bottle feeding milk to a two-day-old calf at a dairy farm in Morgan County, Colo. The Latino population has grown rapidly in the state.Over the summer, when the push for immigration reform stalled in Washington, Hispanic activists flocked to Mr. Gardner\u2019s district offices in northeastern Colorado to pressure him to vote for a comprehensive package that passed the Democrat-controlled Senate, supported by Mr. Udall. But Mr. Gardner says that granting citizenship or its benefits to millions of undocumented immigrants \u201cwill only encourage more illegal immigration.\u201dAs she drives across her district, Ms. Navarro-Ratzlaff said she sometimes stopped at homes with \u201cLatinos for Obama\u201d signs in the yard. She tells her story, of being a fifth-generation Coloradan who was raised by a single mother. Of how she worked nights in a pickle plant and is still paying off her college loans. She talks about how she registered as a Democrat because her mother told her to, but found a home in the Republican Party. And in a state where borders and state lines were drawn up around Hispanic families who had lived here for centuries, Ms. Navarro said the Republican message on immigration has the potential to resonate.\u201cOur Hispanic culture believes in securing our borders,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to honor the law-abiding citizens that have followed the appropriate steps to becoming an American. Democrats have used this against us, but the fact remains that illegal is illegal.\u201d\u2018Rugged Collaboration\u2019The tourists are back in Estes Park, a summertime Brigadoon at the foot of Rocky Mountain National Park. Last September, all of this was water, mud and devastation.As the worst floods in a generation carved a $2.9 billion trail of devastation through the state, they washed out roads in Estes Park, swept homes off their foundations and wrecked the floors of Julie Pieper\u2019s main-street restaurant, Mama Rose\u2019s.On this diamond-clear summer day, Ms. Pieper was serving up turkey-bacon wraps and homemade potato chips to about 100 supporters who had come to see Mr. Udall. A passionate mountain climber who lives in the mountain town of Eldorado Springs, Mr. Udall completed a quest this summer to scale Colorado\u2019s 100 highest peaks. He looked at home weaving through the sun-bronzed crowd, which included hikers, kayakers and Dr. Thomas F. Hornbein, a climber whose ascent up the West Ridge of Mount Everest remains one of the greatest feats of mountaineering.Mr. Udall\u2019s pitch to the crowd was \u201crugged collaboration.\u201d He said the phrase exemplified how government agencies and nonprofits, residents and businesses worked together after the floods. People took in neighbors who had been washed out. They set up zip lines to cross torrential rivers. In a year, much of the devastation has been repaired or is well on the way.\u201cThe response was spectacular,\u201d Ms. Pieper said. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends who are Republicans who support this crew because of the response.\u201dMr. Udall has attacked Mr. Gardner for his votes during last year\u2019s government shutdown, which came as flood-stricken towns remained cut off from the world and scores of families were still homeless. In Estes Park, he called it irresponsible and \u201cdisqualifying, in my view, to being a United States senator.\u201dMr. Gardner said he had pushed to find a solution to the shutdown as it dragged on for two weeks last October, and said he and Mr. Udall had worked together to get federal money for recovery here. \u201cWe were in helicopters together overseeing the efforts in the days following the flood,\u201d Mr. Gardner said in an interview. \u201cIt is below the office of the United States Senate to attack a member of the delegation he knows was a partner.\u201dThe Udall campaign and other groups have also attacked Mr. Gardner for co-sponsoring the Life at Conception Act, a bill that would grant full legal rights to people from \u201cthe moment of fertilization.\u201d It would potentially outlaw abortion at any stage and \u2014 critics contend \u2014 some forms of birth control. While Mr. Gardner said he no longer supported a similar \u201cpersonhood\u201d measure on the ballot this November in Colorado, he has been forced in debates and interviews to explain why he is still backing the federal bill.For Democrats, the focus on abortion is part of a strategy aimed at making Mr. Gardner appear as anti-woman as possible to voters like Ann Cerny, a pathologist\u2019s assistant in Erie. She said her views on spending and government made her a Republican at her core, but that working with fetal tissue samples every day in her lab had put women\u2019s health issues front and center this election.\u201cAs a woman, I want to make sure women\u2019s health care is O.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cPersonhood, anything with abortion \u2014 that\u2019s my job. I have to have freedom of choice.\u201d Her conclusion: \u201cI cannot vote Republican.\u201dBut to Debbie Brown, a former Republican campaign manager who now leads a statewide women\u2019s group, the attention to reproductive issues is maddening. In 2010, Ms. Brown watched Democrats win 56 percent of the women\u2019s vote in the 2010 Senate race, in part by portraying Republicans as dogmatic enemies of abortion and birth control. She organized the Colorado Women\u2019s Alliance as a conservative counterweight to liberals whom she says are obsessed with reproductive politics.\u201cWhat else you got?\u201d she asked over coffee one rainy morning. \u201cI could care less about birth control. It\u2019s widely available, and I think that\u2019s awesome. There\u2019s not a crisis.\u201dWhile Mr. Gardner\u2019s campaign argues that his positions are being distorted by the Udall camp, Ms. Brown and her group are trying to change the definition of what constitutes an election-year \u201cwomen\u2019s issue.\u201d What about energy? she asked. What about jobs, wages and health care? In panels she has assembled, Ms. Brown said women felt that the laserlike focus on reproductive issues was a ploy for their votes.When money is so tight that your family disconnects the phone line and cable and wears sweaters to save on heating, worrying about abortion laws seems like an unaffordable luxury, said Margo Branscomb, a single mother in the southern Denver suburb of Centennial.\u201cEverybody needs to stay out of the bedroom,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should be an individual\u2019s choice in all respects, whether it\u2019s a wedding or all these social issues.\u201dIn Erie, from behind the counter of his gold and silver shop, Levi Hatgi is watching the changes rippling through Colorado.

But when Ms. Tsvor wanted to charter a helicopter to take her and her friends for a ride over Chicago, she had the currency.Nikoletta Csanyi, 28, a banking consultant, leveraged her capital for a three-year lease on a 2014 Mercedes-Benz CLA.Jason M. Peterson, 44, used his assets to get a first-class plane ticket to Iceland, where he stayed for a week at no cost.These were deals made in exchange for posts on Instagram, where a thriving economy has emerged amid the scroll of pretty pictures. Luxury brands have been hiring bloggers to plug their goods for years. But words are so Gen Y. Now marketers from companies like Burberry, Holiday Inn and Nike are trying to leverage the visual Internet to reach a young generation of consumers that increasingly gravitates toward media in the form of images (emoji, Tinder, Instagram).These brands are looking to co-opt the Insta-fluence of people posting photographs of their lives and experiences in a way that is interesting to strangers (sometimes tens of thousands of them, or more).As was the case when bloggers first came to Internet renown, some deals between brands and so-called Grammers are pay-for-play, while others involve an exchange of products for a well-styled, engaging post.Among the three in-air photos Ms. Tsvor posted over the next few weeks was an at-dusk bird\u2019s-eye view of the city that she published with the caption, \u201cJust looking for some new roofs to climb @chetours.\u201d It garnered nearly 3,400 \u201clikes.\u201dMs. Csanyi got her Mercedes by winning a contest that required her to take the car on a three-day road trip to Washington, D.C., and post photos from the trip that included in the caption the @mbusa Instagram handle and the hashtag: #ClataketheWheel.Among her photos of the car was one lit in the background by the glowing rotunda of the Capitol. In the caption she wrote: \u201cGood night D.C. We had a lot going on today, will share more of the awesomeness tomorrow morning. Sleep tight @mbusa, we will dream with #clatakethewheel.\u201dFor Mercedes, reaching the Instagram community was a central marketing strategy. The CLA went on sale last fall at a starting price of about $29,000 with the goal of drawing younger consumers. For the millennial generation, which spends a lot of time scrolling through social media feeds, Instagram influencers are far more important than celebrities. \u201cThey\u2019re more approachable. Celebrity is just not relatable,\u201d said Mark Aikman, Mercedes-Benz USA\u2019s manager of digital marketing. \u201cThe prize Niki has with the CLA is not payment for her messaging,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a prize.\u201dStart-up companies with Instagram accounts are also able to leverage their social currency as capital. Blade, an app-based helicopter service that shuttles people between Manhattan and the Hamptons, used Instagram to help it overcome a significant business obstacle: Helicopter travel is reliant on good weather, and Blade wanted a rainy-day alternative for customers who booked flights in advance.Instagram influencers say they have fielded significant interest from brands in the last year \u2014 and that even large corporate brands agree not to interfere with their creative process. The labels aren\u2019t just looking for help reaching niche Instagram communities. They often also want assistance creating effective marketing images. That means they need the Grammers to present their products to their homegrown audience with the aesthetic that drew the audience in the first place.\u201cThere is a tremendous amount of authenticity and credibility that these photographers have with their followers,\u201d said David Duplantis, the president of global digital and customer experience for Coach, the luxury label that for the last two years has been hiring Instagrammers to promote its goods.Inevitably, the middlemen have arrived. Corbett Drummey, 24, last year helped found Popular Pays, an app that both connects influencers with businesses that want to hire them to work on marketing campaigns as well as posters with smaller followings who might be happy to get a freebie in exchange for an Insta-plug. Popular Pays operates in 10 cities including New York, Chicago and San Francisco, and has 10,000 active users, Mr. Drummey said. \u201cFor a lot of people on Instagram, there are a ton of places in New York City you can go for a free cup of coffee.\u201dRefinery29, the fashion website (also known as R29), engages influential Instagrammers as a key part of its marketing strategy. \u201cFor a fashion audience, Instagram is such an amazing medium,\u201d said Piera Gelardi, the site\u2019s executive creative director. \u201cIt\u2019s visually inspiring and it\u2019s accessible.\u201dTo try to tap into the followings of Instagrammers geared toward fashion and adventure, R29 four months ago began to host \u201cInstaMeets.\u201d The first brought about 20 Grammers to the company\u2019s studio, surrounding them with models and props like edible Pantone chips, brightly colored candy and disco balls. \u201cIt was a playground,\u201d Ms. Gelardi said. The event generated 128 posts tagged \u201c#r29instameet\u201d that drew more than 78,000 likes. That day, 590 followers joined the Refinery29 Instagram feed, more than 50 percent above the usual daily rate.During New York Fashion Week last month, R29 hosted an Instagram meet-up with the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Thirty-five influential social media photographers were invited to a private viewing of a nine-hole miniature golf course built in a rented SoHo space. Each hole was inspired by the aesthetic of a different American designer.Jaimee Dormer was among the Instagrammers looking for the perfect photo-op. Her personal feed, @ohhaiitsmee, has more than 170,000 followers. This was her third R29 Instagram meet-up. \u201cThere are the best props you can imagine.\u201dMs. Dormer, 30, said she knows that R29 hosts these events to leverage the audiences that people like her have built. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI have my own brand and they match with it a hundred percent.\u201dShe uses her Insta-fluence for her own benefit as well. She is an owner of Coast to Coast Vintage \u2014 a company that she and her boyfriend operate out of a 1976 Serro Scotty camper filled with vintage clothes. Driving around the country, they trade Instagram photographs of bars, restaurants and flea markets for the right to park outside the establishments, and offer a pop-up shopping experience for passers-by. \u201cBeing able to park, for us, is huge,\u201d she said. \u201cWe exist solely on doing these pop-ups and on the generosity of people letting us eat into their traffic.\u201dAdam J. Kurtz, a graphic designer, was at the Refinery29 event, too, but he left after about a half-hour. He posted one photo and then deleted it. \u201cIt felt heavy-handed,\u201d he said.\u201cI am still coming to terms with my Instagram influence,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this talk about \u2018collaborations\u2019 and taking part in hashtag projects just doesn\u2019t feel honest to me.\u201dMr. Kurtz said he has turned down a half-dozen brands in the last several months that wanted pay-for-play coverage on his page. He did, however, accept one gig with a company that makes specialty iPhone cases. The company let him design cases that he would promote on Instagram. On one case, a dictionary definition is printed backward so that it will be readable when someone takes a selfie with the camera cases pointed at a mirror. The term it defines: narcissistic personality disorder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Dollar\u2019s Rise Tells Us About the Global Economy", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFollow the CurrencyRemember the currency wars? They were about the notion, popular over the last few years among financial commentators and not a few global policy makers, that the nations of earth had become locked in a pattern of debasing their currencies in pursuit of a momentary economic advantage, a race to the bottom that would end in tears for all.Never mind.In other words, if this is a currency war, the United States is losing and seems totally O.K. with that.If it persists, this dollar rally will create winners and losers in the United States, depending on if something is imported or exported. If you frequently fill up your car with imported oil or drink French wine, it\u2019s good news. If you are Boeing competing against Airbus, or General Electric competing against Siemens, or Cadillac competing with Mercedes-Benz, it is terrible news.But what\u2019s really interesting is the reasons for the rally, and what those reasons say about how the global financial markets and the global economy interact.It\u2019s commonplace to look at currency movements as a result of things that central banks do, and not without reason. The currency war talk got heated in the fall of 2010 after the Federal Reserve announced its second, controversial round of quantitative easing, or bond buying. And currency markets (and bond markets, and commodity markets, and so on) are rightly sensitive to the words that emanate from the Federal Reserve building in Washington or the Eurotower in Frankfurt, home of the European Central Bank.But over most longer time horizons, the level of currencies (and bond prices, and commodities, and so on) is shaped by economic fundamentals. How many people are working and what is their level of productivity? Is that an output level at which price pressures start to build, creating inflation, or not?Consider one chart that explains the rally in the dollar about as well as any detailed description of what Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi, the heads of the Fed and E.C.B., have done.The I.M.F. revised its World Economic Outlook on Tuesday, and compared with its forecasts from July, it now expects 2014 economic growth to be 0.5 percentage points stronger in the United States and 0.3 percentage points weaker in the countries using the euro (with particularly weak projections in the core of Europe, namely Germany, France and Italy).It is true that the Federal Reserve finally has its sights on ending its long campaign to push down American interest rates, even as the European Central Bank and others overseas redouble their efforts. But the central banks are in many ways the cart, and the underlying economic performance of the two sides of the Atlantic is the horse.The Fed is now poised to start removing its easy money policies precisely because they have worked and helped spark stronger growth. The European Central Bank is now having to consider more radical action because its earlier reluctance to intervene has led the European economy to a bad place, that and deep-seated imbalances in the European economy.The mantra of the global finance ministers and central bankers over the last year has been that countries must pursue a mix of policies that will ensure stable growth and stable prices in their countries \u2014 \u201cdomestic tools for domestic purposes,\u201d as Mr. Lew put it Tuesday \u2014 and that exchange rates can then settle where they may.Financial policy makers have generally abided by this. Even when taking actions that are sure to drive down their currencies, they have usually framed it as being focused on domestic purposes. (The exception has been some recent rumblings from Mr. Draghi about pushing down the euro, though that may be because in export-centric, inflation-phobic Germany, it goes over far better to say \u201cwe need cheaper money to make the currency more competitive\u201d than \u201cwe need cheaper money to increase inflation.\u201d)That helps explain why the Americans are taking the rising dollar in stride. Even as officials will surely start to get an earful from American exporters, they can take solace in the fact that the rally is being driven by a long-awaited pickup in domestic economic activity. And the United States, they are concluding, has more to gain from Europe and Japan getting their policies right and getting their economies on track than it has to lose from American companies facing a less advantageous exchange rate for the time being.Advertisement"}

After all, the events that brought on the Great Recession \u2014 the housing bust, the banking crisis \u2014 took place a long time ago. Why can\u2019t we escape their legacy?The proximate answer lies in a series of policy mistakes: Austerity when economies needed stimulus, paranoia about inflation when the real risk is deflation, and so on. But why do governments keep making these mistakes? In particular, why do they keep making the same mistakes, year after year?The answer, I\u2019d suggest, is an excess of virtue. Righteousness is killing the world economy. What, after all, is our fundamental economic problem? A simplified but broadly correct account of what went wrong goes like this: In the years leading up to the Great Recession, we had an explosion of credit (mainly to the private sector). Old notions of prudence, for both lenders and borrowers, were cast aside; debt levels that would once have been considered deeply unsound became the norm. Then the music stopped, the money stopped flowing, and everyone began trying to \u201cdeleverage,\u201d to reduce the level of debt. For each individual, this was prudent. But my spending is your income and your spending is my income, so when everyone tries to pay down debt at the same time, you get a depressed economy.What\u2019s striking about the past few years, however, is how little debt relief has actually taken place. Yes, there\u2019s Iceland \u2014 but it\u2019s tiny. Yes, Greek creditors took a significant \u201chaircut\u201d \u2014 but Greece is still a small player (and still hopelessly in debt). In major economies, very few debtors have received a break. And far from being inflated away, the burden of debt has been aggravated by falling inflation, which is running well below target in America and near zero in Europe.But it has been very hard to get either the policy elite or the public to understand that sometimes debt relief is in everyone\u2019s interest. Instead, the response to poor economic performance has essentially been that the beatings will continue until morale improves.Maybe, just maybe, bad news \u2014 say, a recession in Germany \u2014 will finally bring an end to this destructive reign of virtue. But don\u2019t count on it.Charles M. Blow is off today. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christine Kenneally\u2019s \u2018Invisible History of the Human Race\u2019", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Of Christine Kenneally\u2019s father\u2019s father \u2014 a man neither Kenneally nor her father ever knew, a man who did the deed requisite to reproduction and promptly vanished \u2014 she asks, \u201cDid he leave anything more significant than the loud bang of a door shut down the generations?\u201d Of course he did. He left his DNA and a granddaughter determined to draw from modern genetics and hard-won family history a coherent account of her roots. Kenneally\u2019s own heritage is only one of the mysteries she pursues in \u201cThe Invisible History of the Human Race,\u201d a smart, splendid, highly entertaining look at how DNA, increasingly visible to us since we first sequenced the human genome in 2000, can \u201copen up tracts of human history that had been entirely obscure.\u201d While DNA may now be visible, however, it remains more hint than history. Kenneally, a journalist and linguist, shows that just as a gene usually delivers its genetic message only in conversation with an incoming chemical messenger, so our DNA tells its tales most fully only in light of the history of the people who carry and interrogate it. It takes all those threads to get the whole story. And Kenneally wants it all. \u201cIf everyone had his DNA analyzed,\u201d she writes, \u201cand that information were linked to everyone\u2019s historical information, it would be the nearest thing to the book of humanity.\u201d She backs up this claim beautifully, showing how genetic analysis can be combined with skillful mining of historical, social and cultural information to solve fascinating riddles of ancestry.The book would stand strong on its weird factoids alone. For instance: In Europe, the inheritance of surnames became common in the last 200 to 900 years, depending on country and culture, which makes it difficult to trace a family tree back beyond about 1500. Also: The rarer a surname, the more likely two men bearing it are related. Thus 87 percent of the few men named Attenborough descend from a single, distant forefather. (No wonder Richard and David are brothers.) Possibly my favorite: Sex cuts and reshuffles our genomes so sloppily that much DNA gets lost through the generations, like dropped playing cards. You have many distant ancestors from whom you received very little or even no DNA.Despite such wonders of ancestral science, Kenneally finds that many people consider genealogy silly. A scholar prominent a century ago opined that people who charted their family trees did so out of \u201csnobbishness and vanity.\u201d In 2007, one science writer warned his genealogy-\u00adobsessed daughter that \u201cnothing in her genealogy defines her.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Kenneally replies. \u201cIf a person\u2019s genealogy is the series of individuals whose coupling eventually produced that person, then it\u2019s hard to see how this assertion is plausible.\u201d For many, unease with genealogy stems from its exploitation by eugenicists. In Nazi Germany, for instance, one\u2019s family tree, embedded in official identification papers, became literally a matter of life and death. Eugenicists have rationalized some of history\u2019s most heinous acts with the science of ancestry. But eugenics, Kenneally reminds us, was born as and remains a distortion of science. Its founders and champions were elites who took inherent differences as a given \u2014 and themselves as humanity\u2019s highest form. The problem was not the theories but \u201cthe way they were used to give longstanding social divisions a scientific rationale.\u201dYet the past\u2019s value and meaning are rendered powerfully clear in Kenneally\u2019s stories of people whose pasts were erased by history: African-Americans, Jews, orphans. Genetic analyses and genealogical databases like those at Ancestry.com and Family Tree DNA, especially when combined with earnest exploration in archives, now enable people to reconstruct lost lineages. Far more often than not, their reconnection with both family and history changes and deepens their lives. Other sleuthings examine broader puzzles: One chapter describes a fascinating study in which maps of genetic differences within the British Isles neatly match cultural and linguistic distinctions. Perhaps the book\u2019s most resounding sections are those showing how culture, rather than genetics, can shape lasting differences in human values and behavior. Kenneally describes a study by the economists Nico Voigtl\u00e4nder and Hans-Joachim Voth, which found persistent differences in anti-Semitism among towns in Germany. Communities that reacted to the Black Death some 600 years ago by blaming and massacring Jews were far more likely to lead pogroms against Jews in the 1920s and to turn Jews over to the Nazis in the 1930s and \u201940s. In a separate series of studies, the economists Nathan Nunn of Harvard and Leonard Wantchekon of Princeton found a similar cultural legacy that shaped trust \u2014 a trait some presume to vary according to genetic makeup. Nunn and Wantchekon noticed that the poorest regions of Africa were the regions most exploited by slave traders in the 18th and 19th centuries. These areas suffered decades of raiding in which any stranger might prove a kidnapper, and in which slavers often gained access to their victims by bribing or blackmailing relatives or village authorities. Clearly such behaviors may have eroded trust at the time, but could the effect last? Nunn and Wantchekon found that it does. The more a population was exposed to slave raiding generations ago, the lower its measures of trust and economic activity today. The specter of slavery, they concluded, had done long-term damage to the social bonds necessary for efficient trade. The economies and people continue to suffer accordingly. It\u2019s a far more plausible and evidence-based explanation for Africa\u2019s economic troubles than the one offered by Nicholas Wade\u2019s recent book, \u201cA Troublesome Inheritance,\u201d which, with vaporous evidence, attributes weak African economies to African-\u00adspecific genetic profiles that purportedly discourage trust. Genetics gives all humans the power to create culture. Yet it appears most likely that it is not genetics but culture\u2019s manifestations, some lovely, some horrific, that distinguish and divide us.Alas, even these fancy new tools can\u2019t crack every mystery. Kenneally doesn\u2019t find her missing grandfather, but she does discover further up her father\u2019s family tree a convict \u2014 one Michael Deegan, her great-great-grandfather, who in the mid-1800s was shipped from Ireland to Australia with a boatload of criminals for stealing a handkerchief. Her father absorbed this news far better than he did his father\u2019s haunting absence, confirming Kenneally\u2019s belief that people who excavate their pasts are almost always glad they did. It\u2019s easier to embrace a thief than a phantom.Given how fast genealogy is advancing, Kenneally may find her missing grandfather yet. Given how fast genetics is advancing, parts of her book may need updating even as the ink dries. But what will prove lasting is her evocation of how much perspective and even wisdom can be extracted from some determined digging and a bit of spit. The breadth of this book; its abundance of enthralling accounts and astonishing science; its adept, vivid writing; and Kenneally\u2019s exquisitely calibrated judgment make it the richest, freshest, most fun book on genetics in some time.

{"Headline": "Chen Ziming, Dissident in China, Is Dead at 62", "Date": "2014-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChen Ziming, a Chinese dissident and democracy advocate who was accused by the government of fomenting the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and spent more than a decade in prison and under house arrest, died on Tuesday in Beijing. He was 62.The cause was cancer, said Wang Juntao, a fellow dissident who was arrested and sentenced with Mr. Chen.A reform-minded intellectual, Mr. Chen had a history of challenging government orthodoxy. He was first sent to prison in 1975 because of letters he had written criticizing the Gang of Four, the political faction surrounding Mao Zedong at the end of his life. In the 1980s, he and Mr. Wang founded an independent think tank, the Beijing Social and Economics Research Institute. He also published an influential periodical, Economics Weekly, that reported on the effects of China\u2019s limited forays into a free-market economy. Previously, during a brief period of liberalization in the late 1970s, he helped found a pro-democracy magazine, Beijing Spring.Mr. Chen and Mr. Wang offered counsel to the leaders of the student-sponsored pro-democracy demonstrations that led the government to declare martial law and culminated on June 4, 1989, with tanks rolling into Tiananmen Square, the site of the largest demonstrations, and soldiers firing on and killing demonstrators.In the aftermath, Mr. Chen and Mr. Wang \u2014 not radicals by any means, and hoping to avoid violent confrontation \u2014 were condemned as the \u201cblack hands\u201d of the democracy movement, the puppeteers who engineered the demonstrations. Each received a sentence of 13 years in prison. Mr. Wang and Mr. Chen were both released in 1994, but Mr. Chen was rearrested in 1995, reportedly because he had staged a hunger strike to commemorate the events of Tiananmen Square. Because of ill health, he was allowed to go home in 1996 to finish his sentence under house arrest. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do too much,\u201d Mr. Wang, who now lives in New Jersey, said in a phone interview on Friday. \u201cWe organized a round table meeting to establish a command system for demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. But before that, before martial law, we tried to convince students to start with a hunger strike and to withdraw from Tiananmen Square, but we failed.\u201dMr. Chen was born in or near Shanghai on Jan. 8, 1952, and grew up in Beijing. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a manager at a film production studio, were midlevel officials of the Communist Party. As part of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, he was sent to Inner Mongolia, where he inoculated poor Mongols against diseases, helped devise water preservation systems and read political philosophy. When he returned to Beijing in 1974 to attend Beijing Chemical Industry College, he was considered for admission to the Communist Party, but he was unsettled by turmoil within the central government. Mao and his more progressive second-in-command, Zhou Enlai, were near death, and the Gang of Four appeared poised to seize power. When Mr. Chen\u2019s correspondence expressing alarm at the Gang of Four\u2019s ascendance was intercepted, he was jailed and sentenced to \u201creform through labor,\u201d performing menial tasks. Then, in April 1976, he took part in a citizen demonstration against the Gang of Four in Tiananmen Square and had his epiphany.As recounted in \u201cBlack Hands of Beijing,\u201d a 1993 book by George Black and Robin Munro about the events surrounding the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, Mr. Chen was at the front of the crowd standing before a poster that boldly challenged the Gang of Four\u2019s authority. Prompted by other demonstrators, Mr. Chen read the words on the poster aloud for all to hear in a thrilling act of public defiance.\u201cFrom several rows back in the crowd, a voice yelled, \u2018Comrades at the front, please read the poster out loud!\u2019\u00a0\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cChen felt a gentle tap on the shoulder. \u2018That hand on my shoulder,\u2019 he told a group of friends several years later, \u2018made a wave 10,000 feet high swell in my brain.\u2019\u00a0\u201d After his sentence was completed in 2002, Mr. Chen said, he continued to be monitored by the government and was barred from giving interviews for four years. He published articles only under pseudonyms. A website he started was shut down by the government in 2005 without explanation.\u201cI have been shunted back and forth between three departments: the police, the communications agency and the Beijing municipal news office,\u201d he said in a 2006 interview with Radio Free Asia. \u201cNone of them will give me a straight answer about whose decision it was to close the site. They won\u2019t give us a reason for the closure, either.

That has freed Mr. Assad\u2019s military from worrying about checking the militant group\u2019s advances and allowed them to continue to focus attacks on the greater political threat \u2014 less extreme Syrian-based insurgent groups bent on ousting Mr. Assad and the communities where they hold sway.The Syrian government had long focused its attacks on insurgents other than the Islamic State, a group that had seemed more interested in establishing Islamic rule in its territories than in ousting Mr. Assad. But after the group overran parts of Iraq and carried out a series of lightning routs of Syrian Army bases, terrifying many government supporters, Syrian warplanes began attacking it with more intensity in its eastern strongholds.Since the American-led campaign began about two weeks ago, however, the need for Syrian forces to check the Islamic State has ebbed, and some insurgents who oppose the militant group say the government attacks on them have intensified.Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.A United States official said there were indications that since the American campaign started, Syrian fighter jets and helicopters had increased strikes somewhat in the core territories of non-Islamic State insurgents, such as Idlib, Aleppo and the Damascus suburbs.\u201cIt would be silly for them not to take advantage of the U.S. doing airstrikes,\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence reports. \u201cThey\u2019ve focused in the west and left off the east, where we are operating. Essentially, we\u2019ve allowed them to perform an economy of force. They don\u2019t have to be focused all over the country, just on those who threaten their population centers.\u201dThat dynamic is at the heart of Washington\u2019s impasse with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who is demanding that President Obama increase efforts to oust Mr. Assad before Turkey takes tougher action against the Islamic State.The attacks by the Syrian government are creating other political problems for the United States. With both air forces in the sky, attacks by the Syrian government can be mistaken for American ones, including raids that kill civilians.Mistrust of the United States is deepening among Syrian opponents of the government, including insurgents whom Mr. Obama hopes to train as a ground force against Islamic State militants.\u201cSyria is divided between Assad and the coalition,\u201d said Suhail, a fighter with the Free Syrian Army, the loose-knit group from whose ranks the United States is vetting potential allies. \u201cThe Syrian citizen is paying the price. The coalition took some of the burden from the regime.\u201dSome Syrians go further, saying that the simultaneous bombings are evidence that the United States is covertly coordinating with the Syrian government. Mr. Obama has publicly ruled out such coordination, saying Mr. Assad lost his legitimacy after using force against peaceful protesters and carrying out indiscriminate bombings.\u201cFrom a military perspective \u2014 there\u2019s no communication or coordination with the Assad regime,\u201d said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, adding that American strikes were focused in \u201clargely ungoverned spaces that he long ago lost any control over.\u201dAmerican pilots are under orders to avoid any contact with Syrian warplanes, military officials said, and, using navigational instruments and data from allied aircraft, do not need to communicate with them to avert collisions.With oil revenues, arms and organization, the jihadist group controls vast stretches of Syria and Iraq and aspires to statehood.That nuance, though, is lost on Syrians who feel abandoned by the world, and see Washington\u2019s decision to prioritize the battle against the Islamic State as a victory for Mr. Assad\u2019s strategy of eliminating moderate opposition and presenting his international opponents with a choice between him and extremists.\u201cOur protection as civilians and as minorities is not on the coalition\u2019s political agenda\u201d said Nadeen, a Syrian Christian who opposes the government and lives in the government-held section of divided Aleppo. \u201cNor is fighting the regime.\u201dAsking that only her first name be used for her safety, she added, \u201cIf they are serious about arming the opposition, they would not allow Assad to eliminate rebels and civilians.\u201dAt the same time, the campaign against the Islamic State faces challenges of its own in Kobani, the Syrian Kurdish enclave on the brink of falling to the militants. American-led airstrikes grew more frequent on Tuesday and Wednesday amid an outcry over the coalition\u2019s failure to stop the assault. But the bombardment did not prevent Islamic State militants from moving north, deeper into the town and closer to the Turkish border, said a Kurdish official, Assi Abdullah.Confusion has been deepened by the American decision to strike what it said was a Qaeda cell called the Khorassan Group in Idlib province, in territory held by non-Islamic State insurgents. Further complicating matters, local insurgents and residents knew the fighters targeted in that attack simply as members of the Nusra Front, the Qaeda affiliate in Syria that is viewed as an ally, at least tactically, by many rebel groups, including some nominally allied with the West.That helped lead Syrians to believe that the United States was targeting the insurgency writ large, and that later government airstrikes in the area were carried out by the United States.The Bdama strike was a case in point. Sasha Ghosh-Siminoff, an American aid worker who worked there, said his contacts were convinced that the Americans had hit them, even though insurgents there oppose the Islamic State and some work closely with the Americans.Residents of Idlib and Aleppo now say, \u201cWe don\u2019t know who\u2019s hitting us,\u201d Mr. Ghosh-Siminoff said from Washington, where he runs an aid group called People Demand Change.Even after word came that the strike was conducted by Syrian planes, he said: \u201cIt brings up the question, \u2018Does the American government have a deal with the Assad regime about flying their air force?\u2019 Which is more damaging? I would almost prefer it to be an American airstrike that hit by mistake \u2014 they could apologize and move on.\u201dAnne Barnard reported from Beirut, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.

Four years after an earthquake that devastated Haiti, the squad is trying to qualify for the Women\u2019s World Cup.SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2014 Since 2012, the women\u2019s national soccer team from Haiti has spent six months a year training near the regional airport here, down a country road and just across the railroad tracks, mostly unnoticed, wholly unlikely as a regional power.Each woman on the team has a story of despair about the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere: a house folded like a wallet. A brother\u2019s shattered leg. An aunt crushed by the door of a church. An uncle lost in a building and never found. Each player, too, has a story of resilience and perseverance. No Caribbean nation has ever qualified for the Women\u2019s World Cup. Now Haiti, of all countries, is on the cusp of reaching the expanded 2015 tournament, to be played next summer in Canada. It is a quest of great ambition and meager resources. There is no salary for the players. None for the Polish-American coach and his assistants. Players live eight or nine to an apartment. Even the captain sleeps on a thin mattress in the living room.Haiti\u2019s soccer federation pays for a round-trip flight home each year and tries to help in emergencies. But even a $200 stipend paid to each player in 2013 was unaffordable this year, the federation said. The team tries to make ends meet by selling rotisserie chickens and T-shirts, and holding clinics for churches and schools.Benefactors have been generous. A local soccer club provides training fields at no cost. A repair shop does not charge for work on the team van. Anne Marie Wright, 17, a high school student, has helped provide cleats and socks and sports bras and even water bottles so that players training to reach the World Cup will not have to drink from spigots.Marc Dume, 43, a businessman who immigrated from Haiti a decade ago, assists with the rent and money to buy plantains and rice and beans for aromatic legume stews. Last week, he donated a recreational vehicle to the team.\u201cSoccer is all they have,\u201d said Dume, who runs a company in Elkhart, Ind., that delivers recreational vehicles from factories to dealers. \u201cThey have nothing else.\u201dThe Women\u2019s World Cup will expand next year to 24 teams from 16. Canada, as the host, has automatic entry. Three other teams from the North American, Central American and Caribbean region will qualify at a tournament in the United States that begins Oct. 15. A fourth team will enter a playoff against Ecuador, the third-place qualifier from South America.The Americans, ranked No. 1 in the world, are prohibitive favorites in the regional tournament. Mexico is also expected to claim a berth. That would leave Haiti, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago to try to reach the World Cup for the first time.Kencia Marseille, 33, the team captain, said that her mother spanked her with a belt when she caught her playing as a girl. Today, some mothers still want their daughters home, to study, to help provide for siblings, to restore the bonds of family.\u201cThe Haitian people don\u2019t believe in us,\u201d said goalkeeper Geralda Saintilus, 28. \u201cThey say we\u2019re not good enough. We\u2019ll try to prove them wrong.\u201dEven Haiti\u2019s coach, Shek Borkowski, did not believe in the beginning. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be crazy,\u201d Borkowski said he told himself about becoming Haiti\u2019s coach.He reconsidered after watching online as Haiti participated in the qualifying tournament for the 2012 London Olympics. Haiti fell short, but Borkowski was intrigued by the individual skill of its players.\u201cPart of it was selfish; I wanted to achieve something on the international level,\u201d said the Polish-born Borkowski, 51, who lives in Goshen, Ind., and won two W.P.S.L. titles and a Russian women\u2019s league title before becoming Haiti\u2019s coach on March 20, 2012. \u201cBut you start fighting for these girls.\u201dJean-Bart agreed to the plan, saying of the World Cup in a telephone interview: \u201cIt is very difficult for girls in Haiti to change their lives. This could be a good challenge for all women to try to get a better life.\u201d But Haiti remains a fragile team. Most players lost their homes in the earthquake. Natacha Cajuste, 30, a defender, was studying in an Internet cafe when the shaking began and said she was the only one who made it outside; everyone else died or was injured. Manoucheka Pierre-Louis, 25, a midfielder, said she lived in a tent city for two years before being called to the national team.Haiti\u2019s players became itinerant after the quake, training in the Dominican Republic and in Brazil. At a tournament in Mexico, some players grew wary of staying in a high-rise hotel, fearful of being trapped if it collapsed. \u201cWe played soccer to try to forget,\u201d said Ketura Woodlyne-Robuste, 22, a midfielder.The Haitian players who arrived in South Bend in 2012 were tactically na\u00efve and physically weak, Borkowski said. Many went to the ground at the slightest contact. Equipment was insufficient. Even water bottles were scarce.When the soles of one player\u2019s cleats fell apart during a practice in the summer of 2013, she could not continue because there were no spare shoes, said Wright, now a high school junior, who trained with the Haitians.When Notre Dame changed equipment sponsors, it held a sale at which Wright\u2019s parents helped her buy the Irish\u2019s discarded soccer gear. Last week, the family made another contribution of cleats, vests and moisture-wicking shirts. \u201cThis was a team training for the World Cup,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWe knew we had to do something about it.\u201dIn August, Haiti finished third to Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean Cup and advanced to the final round of World Cup qualifying. The Haitians train twice a day and spend the rest of the time in two team apartments, sleeping, cooking, learning English from watching television, reading children\u2019s books and conversing with the four American-born players in residence.\u201cWe like \u2018WWE SmackDown,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Saintilus, the goalkeeper, said with a laugh, then added that she preferred PBS to wrestling.At times, they have had little more to eat than rice and beans and Ramen noodles. One player left the team to have a baby. Another quit, Borkowski said, after her father died and her mother had a nervous breakdown. Two players were absent for part of last month, having returned to Haiti to renew their visas.In mid-April, Woodlyne-Robuste\u2019s father died, and Haiti\u2019s soccer federation offered to fly her home with one caveat, Borkowski said. The federation would not pay for a return flight until after Haiti hosted a round of World Cup qualifying in late May. Woodlyne-Robuste decided to remain with her teammates.\u201cI\u2019m still hurting, but when I\u2019m playing, I don\u2019t think of my troubles,\u201d Woodlyne-Robuste said.If Haiti reaches the World Cup, she said, she will try to score a goal for her father.\u201cHe bought my first cleats,\u201d she said.To qualify, Borkowski admonished his players at a recent practice, Haiti will need unwavering concentration, discipline and self-belief. For these players, he said, there will only be one chance of a lifetime.The practice ended with a prayer circle, followed by the chant \u201cOne, two, three, 2015!\u201d\u201cSoccer is the only thing that takes the stress away,\u201d said Marseille, the team captain. \u201cIf we make the World Cup, I\u2019m going to be so proud of me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Reserve Caps Its Bond Purchases; Focus Turns to Interest Rates", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a series of sweeping campaigns to revive the American economy, the Federal Reserve has spent much of the last six years purchasing trillions of dollars of bonds. Now it is done.The Fed said on Wednesday that the economy no longer needed quite so much help. It is the third time since 2008 the Fed has announced such a move, but this time officials and analysts say the decision is more likely to stick, signaling an important milestone in the nation\u2019s painfully slow recovery from the Great Recession.The central bank still plans to keep short-term interest rates near zero for a \u201cconsiderable time,\u201d it said in a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee. And it said it would replace maturing bonds to keep its holdings at about $4.5 trillion.The bond-buying campaign has helped to fuel one of the longest bull markets in American history. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen 131 percent since the Fed started its first round of purchases in November 2008. The campaign has also helped to suppress borrowing costs. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has declined from 2.96 percent to 2.32 percent over the same period, even as economic conditions have improved. The impact on the rest of the economy is much harder to assess. The Fed and its supporters say the purchases have held down the cost of mortgage loans and corporate debt, contributing to faster job growth. Other economists dismiss the purchases as inconsequential. And some say the Fed has exacerbated economic inequalities by helping to lift financial markets while the rest of the economy languishes.The Fed critics\u2019 dire predictions, however, have clearly failed to materialize. Some Fed officials and economists warned that the bond purchases, often referred to by experts as quantitative easing, or Q.E., would devalue the dollar and drive up inflation. So far the opposite has happened. The American economy has outperformed other developed parts of the world, helping to strengthen the dollar, while inflation has remained so sluggish that the greater worry is now whether prices are rising too slowly. Kim Schoenholtz, an economics professor at New York University, said the Fed\u2019s bond purchases were particularly effective and important in stabilizing the financial system and stimulating the broader economy in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. But he said that the impact of the purchases had diminished as conditions improved, and that it now made sense to end the program.\u201cI applaud the Fed\u2019s willingness to be aggressive, especially early on in the crisis, and it has made sense for the Fed to run a very accommodative policy,\u201d Mr. Schoenholtz said. \u201cBut we should not be surprised that monetary policy has diminishing returns.\u201dMr. Schoenholtz added that the Fed\u2019s quick and strong response helped to explain why the Fed was nearer to achieving its economic objectives than the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, both of which are now battling to avoid deflation. On Monday, the E.C.B. disclosed the first purchases in a planned campaign to buy private sector assets, a kind of entry-level quantitative easing. But the amount the central bank bought \u2014 1.7 billion euros, or $2.16 billion, worth \u2014 was considered a drop in the bucket by analysts and fueled speculation that the E.C.B. would soon be forced to take larger steps.Many House Republicans regard the bond purchases as a form of reckless meddling, and they have passed legislation to constrain the Fed\u2019s flexibility during future downturns. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the long-term legacy of the policy will reflect the harm it has done to our nation\u2019s seniors, savers and all Americans faced with greater uncertainty and the possibility of a Q.E.-induced bubble,\u201d Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican, said on Wednesday.Nonetheless, some experts say the economy remains weak, the purchases remain an effective medicine and the Fed is retreating prematurely. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, cast the sole dissenting vote on Wednesday, arguing that inflation was rising too slowly to stop buying bonds.The Fed started buying bonds for the first time in modern times because it had run out of other options. Under Ben S. Bernanke, then the Fed\u2019s chairman, the central bank cut its benchmark short-term interest rate to zero in December 2008, maxing out its primary means of influencing economic conditions. Mr. Bernanke had argued years earlier that central banks could further reduce borrowing costs by purchasing long-term bonds. The idea was that reducing the supply would force investors to accept lower interest rates from borrowers. Under Mr. Bernanke and then under his successor, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed proceeded to expand its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to $4.5 trillion, from less than $1 trillion.Looking back on the results earlier this year, Mr. Bernanke, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, quipped, \u201cWell, the problem with Q.E. is it works in practice, but it doesn\u2019t work in theory.\u201dMichael Woodford, an economist at Columbia University and a leading monetary policy theorist, is among the doubters. \u201cThere seems little reason to believe that purchases of long-term Treasuries should be an effective way of lowering the kind of longer-term interest rates that matter most for stimulating economic activity,\u201d he said in 2012 at the Fed\u2019s annual economic policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. This was less a research finding than a statement of principles. Mr. Woodford is the creator of a widely used macroeconomic model that basically assumed the purchases would have no effect.The consequences of ending the campaign are also in dispute.Federal Reserve officials generally argue that the impact comes mostly from the size of the Fed\u2019s holdings. In this view, the end of purchases is a minor event. Much more important is the Fed\u2019s intention to maintain the portfolio at its current size until after it starts to raise rates.Others, however, see the flow of purchases as more important. A third view saw the purchases primarily as a means of reassuring markets that short-term rates would stay low. So far, events have tended to support the Fed\u2019s view. The tapering of bond purchases has not shaken the conviction of investors that the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates before the middle of next year.Barbara J. Cummings, director of fixed income at Boston Private Wealth Management, said the low rates highlighted the relative impotence of Fed policy. \u201cI really believe that rates will continue to stay low because I think that there are other factors that are larger than what the Fed was doing,\u201d she said, citing concerns about Europe that are driving flows of money into Treasuries.The Fed upgraded its appraisal of labor market conditions in its statement on Wednesday, saying that \u201cunderutilization of labor market resources is gradually diminishing.\u201d The Fed also sought to play down concerns about the slow pace of inflation, saying that the likelihood of persistently low inflation has actually diminished since earlier this year.\u201cI do think this has been a success story,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that when the time comes to raise interest rates, that they\u2019ll do an equally clear job of foreshadowing that.\u201dBut a voice from the past, the former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, warned on Wednesday that the next phase of the Fed\u2019s retreat would not unfold so smoothly. Asked whether the Fed could avoid turmoil, he responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible.\u201d Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

Republicans, the president said, \u201cjust keep on offering the same tired theories of the economy that we know haven\u2019t worked. In fact, they\u2019ve undermined the middle class.\u201dIn a brief New England swing through solidly Democratic territory, Mr. Obama was seeking to rally core supporters and dramatize the stakes on Election Day. He pointed to a new government report showing that the economy grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter as evidence that his policies have worked.It is a theme he will highlight on Friday in a speech in Providence, R.I., as he labors to shift the public focus from his administration\u2019s handling of the Ebola crisis to pocketbook issues that his advisers said play to Democrats\u2019 advantage.But world events were frustrating Mr. Obama\u2019s plans, just as they have for the past several months, and threatening to drown out his closing arguments in the campaign.Mr. LePage said on Thursday that he was at an impasse with Ms. Hickox and would \u201cexercise the full extent of his authority\u201d to enforce the quarantine. Mr. Obama has made it clear he does not believe health workers exposed to Ebola should be barred from going out in public, and on Wednesday called them \u201cheroes\u201d who should be treated with \u201cdignity.\u201dBut he tried to steer clear of the controversy on Thursday.

{"Headline": "Better to Govern a Company Well Than to Manage Crises", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyHow should companies manage a crisis? Tesco, the British retailer, is the latest large corporation to go through the wringer after it revealed last month that it had overstated its half-year profit estimate by 250 million pounds, or $400 million. Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has started an inquiry, and speculation is swirling that Tesco might have to sell more shares.Tesco\u2019s travails offer a case study about what to do (and what not to do) when disaster strikes. Two other big British corporate crises \u2014 the ones that afflicted Barclays following a scandal in 2012 over the manipulation of a key international interest rate and BP after its Deepwater Horizon oil rig blew up in 2010 \u2014 back up these lessons.The main one is to take things seriously and apologize. Tesco is doing better on this score than either BP or Barclays did. The retailer immediately suspended four senior executives and called in an independent accounting firm to investigate. A month earlier, after a previous profit warning, it cut its dividend 75 percent.One of BP\u2019s mistakes was to try to hang onto its dividend. As crude oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico and American politicians, including President Obama, lambasted the company, this became politically and financially impossible. But by then, BP had lost credibility with investors and the public.Both BP and Barclays also tried to keep their chief executives for too long. They mistakenly thought they could ride out the storm. Eventually, both Tony Hayward, the BP boss, and Robert E. Diamond Jr., his Barclays counterpart, had to quit. But in the process, the reputation of the rest of the board was tarnished. In the case of Barclays, the chairman, Marcus Agius, bizarrely tried to take the heat off his chief executive by resigning himself. He was put firmly back into his box by Mervyn A. King, then the Bank of England governor, and Mr. Diamond quit instead. Mr. Agius also left soon after.With Tesco, there is no question of Dave Lewis, the chief executive, having to quit because he joined the company only last month and so bore no responsibility for the profit misstatement. But the position of his chairman, Richard Broadbent, who has been there for three years, is not secure. One of the criticisms of Mr. Broadbent is that he hasn\u2019t communicated well. In particular, he said that \u201cthings are always unnoticed until they are noticed.\u201d This sophistry made it look like he was making light of the problem or, at least, trying to avoid responsibility for it.But this was not half as bad as some of Mr. Hayward\u2019s gaffes. The BP boss said the spill was \u201crelatively tiny\u201d compared to the \u201cvery big ocean.\u201d In a moment of exasperation, he also said he wanted \u201cmy life back.\u201d That didn\u2019t go down well after 11 workers had lost their lives. Mr. Hayward also went sailing shortly after the disaster. In a crisis, the top team needs to focus 24/7 on solving the problem. Carl-Henric Svanberg, the BP chairman, also made gaffes, including describing the people of Louisiana, where the oil spill reached land, as \u201csmall people.\u201d But he managed to cling onto his position, in part because he had been chairman for only three months and so couldn\u2019t be blamed for the board\u2019s past failings.But how a company fares in a crisis is not just a function of how it behaves when the balloon goes up. Disasters typically reveal longstanding weaknesses in governance, culture and business models. The leadership\u2019s ability to survive often depends on whether it has reserves of good will with key stakeholders. Here Tesco is in a weak position. It engaged in a long period of aggressive international expansion and diversification into financial services. Not only were many of these ventures poorly thought out, but the company also milked its core British business to pay for them at a time when it was facing heightened competition from discount retailers.Part of the case against Mr. Broadbent is that he took too long to remove the last chief executive, Philip Clarke, and that he didn\u2019t do enough to ensure there was adequate talent both on the board and in the business. Astonishingly, no director has retail experience, suggesting that the board was ill-equipped to understand what was going wrong. The company was also operating without a finance director for five months this year.The governance weaknesses were, if anything, even greater at Barclays. Mr. Diamond had been allowed to amass a huge amount of power even before he became chief executive. Mr. Agius wasn\u2019t an effective counterweight.A low reserve of good will was also a big reason why Barclays was so badly hit by the interest rate scandal. Shareholders were furious that Mr. Diamond had just pocketed a big bonus despite admitting that the bank\u2019s results were unacceptable. Politicians were unhappy at the bank\u2019s aggressive-tax-avoidance programs for clients. And its main regulator thought it was often pushing the envelope on what was acceptable.Tesco isn\u2019t in as bad a situation. But last year\u2019s revelation that it kept four corporate jets didn\u2019t go down well with shareholders given that its performance was already flagging.

{"Headline": "New Immunity Provisions Cast Doubt on Greece\u2019s Efforts to Fight Corruption", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 The omnibus bill, more than 100 pages long and titled \u201cMeasures of Support and Growth for the Greek Economy,\u201d won passage here in the middle of the night in March, as Parliament raced to meet a deadline set by Greece\u2019s creditors.Only afterward did a legislator from the governing New Democracy party notice an unsettling provision. Buried on page 78 was language that essentially gave retroactive immunity to thousands of workers in state-funded organizations that could shield them from future corruption prosecutions.That change is among a flurry of new immunity provisions, often slipped into complex or unrelated bills this year, that have triggered outrage among law enforcement officials and critics of the government, who fear that long-awaited efforts to clamp down on corruption are being stymied.\u201cWe cannot estimate how many individuals have been saved from criminal investigations and the money it involves,\u201d said Kostas Tzavaras, the New Democracy lawmaker who discovered the change in the penal code while flipping through the new legislation one evening in his study. \u201cIt\u2019s billions.\u201dYears of rampant corruption helped drive Greece to the brink of bankruptcy. Combating the problem is one of the government\u2019s signal challenges as it tries to restore confidence that it is changing politics as usual and that the sacrifices required under its 240 billion euro, or about $305 billion, bailout are not being foisted on ordinary Greeks alone.Mr. Tzavaras, who has called for a formal investigation by the Supreme Court, is not alone in speaking out about what he sees as quiet efforts to shut down corruption investigations and possibly prevent the clawing back of ill-gotten gains. Leandros Rakintzis, the Greek inspector general, angrily chided Parliament in September for passing laws legitimizing the illegal spending of state funds.\u201cI don\u2019t think it is right that we spend the money to investigate only to have the laws give immunity retroactively,\u201d he said a few days later in his Athens office. \u201cMaybe there should be protection for political decisions. But if you stole a million dollars you should be treated like a common criminal.\u201dIn a rare public complaint, the Association of Greek Judges and Prosecutors has also condemned not only the change to the penal code in the omnibus bill but also three other new immunity provisions.One offered protections for officials who had handled disbursements from a pension fund. Another protected officials who had overseen school building expenses. The third prohibited prosecution of high-level officials who had been working in the Health Ministry but had received postgraduate study benefits.In a statement, the prosecutors said they were seeing \u201claw change after law change\u201d often \u201cinconsistent, incoherent and fragmentary,\u201d a trend that raised suspicions about whether the laws were meant to \u201cserve purposes beyond the national interest.\u201dThe government has said that the change to the omnibus bill \u2014 the substitution of a clause \u2014 was a mistake and of no consequence to future prosecutions.A month later, it passed a new law reinstating language that had long held officials in state-funded institutions criminally liable for embezzlement, breach of trust, document falsification and bribery.But a wide range of experts and law enforcement officials in Greece agree that the retroactive immunity established by the passage of the omnibus bill still stands and remains problematic.Despite repeated queries, the Justice Ministry offered no comment. Some experts say that without some of the new immunity provisions, Greece would be unable to attract top-flight officials.\u201cIn order to get people \u2014 in many cases Greeks who have lived and worked elsewhere \u2014 to come here and take these jobs, you have to say that they will not be held responsible,\u201d said Nicos C. Alivizatos, an expert in constitutional law at the University of Athens. \u201cThese laws are not so much to cover scandal but to allow government to function.\u201dOthers scoff at such reasoning, saying new employees were not going to be held liable for crimes committed in past years. The immunities, they say, are actually a response to the success of anticorruption task forces that have been set up in recent years to answer growing public fury over government officials on the take.Though the task forces operate on shoestring budgets, they have already had a few notable victories in a country that was rarely able to get convictions in the past.Last year, for instance, in a landmark verdict, a former Greek defense minister, Akis Tsochatzopoulos, was found guilty of setting up a complex money-laundering network to cover the trail of millions of dollars in bribes that he pocketed from government weapons purchases.Another official, Antonis Kantas, has admitted that he took so many bribes he cannot remember them all, including some that facilitated the purchase of $4 billion worth of submarines, some of which sit unfinished in a shipyard outside Athens.\u201cWhat you see is the creation of mechanisms for immunity and amnesty for their own,\u201d said Zoe Konstantopoulou, a member of Parliament from the opposition leftist Syriza party who has published a book titled \u201cThe Black Book of Shame,\u201d calling for a change in the wide immunity that legislators have enjoyed for decades.Some law enforcement officials and government critics have said that the immunity provisions passed over the last three years go beyond even those that prosecutors have complained about publicly.They note another law protecting bankers who have issued loans to political parties and a measure saying that excess amounts of severance payments disbursed before 2011 should not be pursued.In addition, officials involved in Greece\u2019s efforts to privatize state assets are to receive special immunities, as are members of Greece\u2019s new Financial Stability Board, which was created to regulate how recapitalization money was allocated to Greek banks.The critics say that immunities that have always existed are being manipulated for maximum effectiveness.Parliament, for instance, must approve any effort to investigate its members, and few such permissions are ever granted. Of 89 felony cases against ministers that were sent by prosecutors to Parliament between June 2012 to May 2014, legislators voted to lift immunity only once, according to Ms. Konstantopoulou.The one case in which immunity was lifted involved the former finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, who is under investigation for his handling of the notorious Lagarde list, which identified about 2,000 Greeks who held secret Swiss bank accounts.Some experts say they believe that Mr. Papaconstantinou will escape prosecution because of yet another special statute of limitations protecting ministers: Under Greek law, after two legislative sessions, a minister can no longer be pursued for his previous actions.Law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not legally allowed to comment on their work, said the new immunities were making it more difficult to prosecute officials for corruption.\u201cIt means we have to find new ways to go forward with these prosecutions,\u201d one official said. \u201cIt probably means that we have to find the money first, which can be very difficult and time consuming, and then prosecute for money laundering, not corruption.\u201dDimitris Bounias contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Overseas Stimulus Moves Drive Yen, Euro and Renminbi Down Against Dollar", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the growth of the United States economy outstrips the rest of the developed world, American policy makers are allowing Europe, Japan and even China to seek a little more prosperity \u2014 at the expense of Americans. The Obama administration and the Federal Reserve have watched quietly in recent years as foreign governments and central banks have chipped away at the dollar value of their currencies, strengthening their export industries in the hope of stimulating their economies.The trend is likely to intensify over the next year as the Fed retreats from its own stimulus campaign while the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan expand their efforts. Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, said on Thursday that it would begin a new round of bond purchases this month.The United States has long argued that markets should determine the value of currencies and criticized nations that try to manipulate exchange rates. The current silence reflects both the simple reality that the American economy needs less help than the rest of the developed world and the judgment of officials that the United States would benefit greatly from stronger global growth. That, they say, would be true even if, in the short term, it makes the country\u2019s goods a little harder to sell and jobs a little harder to find.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing American officials turn a blind eye to Mario Draghi talking down the euro, and turn a blind eye to interventions by the Chinese, because in both cases they\u2019re making the judgment that having a stabilized situation and decent growth prospects in these countries is far more important,\u201d said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cI tend to agree with that.\u201dAmerican leaders have embraced and celebrated a strong dollar as evidence of a strong economy. It lets Americans buy more foreign goods and borrow more cheaply from foreign countries. It also may draw foreign investors to American financial markets, supporting the rise of asset prices.But the rise of the dollar carries large risks, too. It makes it harder for American companies to sell goods and services. It may be contributing to the sluggish pace of domestic inflation. And some economists warn that letting the dollar rise is not a sustainable method of encouraging growth.\u201cA strong dollar, fueled by higher U.S. interest rates, will likely expose vulnerabilities in other parts of the world,\u201d Stephen King, chief global economist at HSBC, wrote in a research note on Thursday. \u201cLatin American countries already flirting with recession would certainly not welcome a tightening of U.S. monetary conditions.\u201d Some economists said the United States should seek to limit the dollar\u2019s rise through diplomacy and policy, and that the Fed should seek to limit its divergence from other central banks by extending its stimulus campaign. But Stephen Cecchetti, a professor at Brandeis University, said the world had a strong interest in Europe\u2019s health. \u201cIt\u2019s going to create some instability, but the alternative is worse,\u201d said Mr. Cecchetti, former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be around if there\u2019s a real depression in Europe.\u201dThe central bank still has not fully deployed the arsenal of a modern central bank to improve growth in Europe. It has refrained from the large-scale purchases of government debt undertaken by the Fed, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England.But in recent months it has sought to push down the value of the euro through a variety of measures. In September, the central bank offered loans that were practically interest-free to commercial banks that promised to lend the money to businesses and consumers.On Thursday, after a board meeting Naples, Italy, the central bank outlined a two-year plan to buy private sector assets, including bank loans packaged into securities. \u201cThese purchases will have a sizable impact,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference after the meeting.One euro, which bought $1.39 in April, bought only $1.26 at the end of September. \u201cWe needed to bring the euro down and we still need to bring the euro down,\u201d Christian Noyer, a central bank board member from France, said in a recent interview with the French broadcaster Radio 1.While such efforts are usually aimed at increasing exports, the central bank is focused on imports, too. A weaker euro raises the price of imported fuel and other products, which could help budge inflation. Prices in the eurozone last month increased at an annualized rate of just 0.3 percent, far below the 2 percent pace the central bank and other major central banks in the developed world regard as best for sustainable growth.\u201cThis is a currency war where stealing inflation rather than growth is the goal,\u201d economists at the British bank HSBC wrote in a report published on Wednesday. The question, they said, \u201cis whether the U.S. economy can generate sufficient inflation internally to tolerate the deflationary impact of a stronger dollar.\u201dAnother question is whether the programs will provide a sufficient jolt. A similar lending program started by the Bank of England in 2012 has not reversed the decline in small-business lending in that country. \u201cNobody\u2019s hiring, nobody\u2019s investing, nobody\u2019s spending,\u201d said Stefano Micossi, the director general of Assonime, an Italian business group. \u201cThere is no demand for credit. The system is not constrained by the funding side. The banks are awash in liquidity.\u201dJapan, which has been grappling with the problems confronting Europe for more than two decades, is also seeking growth through currency moves. Under the \u201cAbenomics\u201d stimulus campaign that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began in early 2013, the Bank of Japan has agreed to double the money supply, and the price of yen in dollars has dropped by about 24 percent.The results have not met expectations. Japan\u2019s trade deficit has increased while inflation remains weak. The Japanese economy shrank by 7.1 percent in the second quarter after a sales tax increase.The country\u2019s struggles may show the limits of devaluation, according to Mr. Posen of the Peterson Institute. He noted that demand was less sensitive to small changes in price for the kinds of high-end goods that dominate the exports of Japan and other developed countries.The government remains publicly committed to its stimulus campaign. But some analysts see signs of tension between the head of the bank, Haruhiko Kuroda, and politicians who are wary that the rise in import prices will provoke consumer resistance.\u201cKuroda is much more powerful than other board members for sure, but not necessarily than politicians,\u201d said Hiromichi Shirakawa, Japan economist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo and a former central bank official. \u201cThis is scary as the markets have been expecting additional easing by the bank within a couple of months.\u201dChina\u2019s economic rise was built on the suppression of its currency to support cheap exports at the expense of domestic consumption. Then, beginning in 2010, China let the renminbi rise about 20 percent against the dollar as part of its effort to encourage a transition away from export-led growth. But this year, with the economy growing at the slowest pace in more than a decade, China once again pressed down on the renminbi. Its value has fallen about 2 percent against the dollar so far this year.\u201cIt was a way to stimulate the economy without resorting to full blown credit and investment-driven stimulus,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, the head of macroeconomic research at Lombard Street Research in London.While that small change has prompted little criticism from the United States, the looming question is whether China will continue.During the financial crisis, China\u2019s government-controlled banking system pumped money into the economy, doubling its assets over a five-year period. Many companies and local governments are now struggling to repay those debts, and authorities are reluctant to treat the pain with another major burst of lending.\u201cChina needs to adjust its economic structure urgently,\u201d Mr. Yu said. \u201cThe combination of the high leverage ratio, high financing costs and low profitability is a serious threat to China\u2019s financial stability.\u201dBut Mr. Yu said the bank might be required to take new steps if the outlook darkened. Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia-Pacific sovereign ratings at Fitch in Hong Kong, said further devaluation had obvious attractions. Noting the appreciation of the currency since 2010, Mr. Colquhoun said, \u201cThe authorities might think they could give some of that back through the renminbi in the event consumption faltered.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum reported from Washington, Jack Ewing from Frankfurt, and Neil Gough from Hong Kong.

The campaign released his 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax summaries last month; 2013 was the third year in a row that Mr. Foley effectively paid no federal income tax.

{"Headline": "The Fed Has Not Stopped Trying to Stimulate the Economy", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyThe most important thing to understand about the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision Wednesday is that it has decided to keep the monetary policy dial set to \u201cstimulate.\u201dIndeed, by conventional measures, monetary policy is currently dialed in to as expansive a setting as it ever has been \u2014 not only in this recovery, but arguably in the history of the nation.Let\u2019s start with the Fed\u2019s standard tool, the federal funds rate, which is set to remain at essentially zero percent, as it has been since late 2008. While we may now be used to it, this was almost unimaginable a generation ago.When the Fed ran out of room to further lower short-term interest rates, it embarked on a program of buying long-term securities to push down long-term interest rates. This program of quantitative easing has led to the Fed today holding an unprecedented $4.5 trillion worth of assets.This number is important, because the Fed believes that it is the total stock of the securities it holds that influences long-term interest rates, not the flow of new purchases. (This perspective is sometimes called the \u201cstock view,\u201d and while it has been endorsed by many Fed economists, some market players remain unconvinced. I am not persuaded by their counterarguments.) Because the Fed plans to continue to hold these assets, you should expect long-term interest rates to remain low, making it cheaper for businesses and families to borrow.Of course, the aspect of Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve decision that has captured the most attention is its decision to stop purchasing further long-term securities. But don\u2019t confuse this with a monetary tightening. It\u2019s hanging on to the stock of securities it currently holds, and the Fed\u2019s preferred \u201cstock view\u201d says that this is what matters for keeping longer-term interest rates low.By this view, the Fed\u2019s decision to end its bond-buying program does not mark the end of its efforts to stimulate the economy. Rather, it is no longer going to keep shifting the monetary dial to yet another more stimulative notch at each meeting. The level of monetary accommodation will remain at a historical high, even if it is no longer expanding.Of course, the fact that the degree of monetary stimulus the economy is receiving is historically high does not mean that it is sufficient. It is now nearly seven years since the recession hit, and unemployment remains high, even as inflation has continued to run below the Fed\u2019s target. It is a sad indictment of our macroeconomic policy makers \u2014 both fiscal and monetary \u2014 that it has taken this long to fashion an adequate response.But for all the hubbub about the decision to end quantitative easing, realize that the degree of monetary support the economy is receiving tomorrow will be no smaller than it was receiving yesterday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Nearly Static After Days of Losses ", "Date": "2014-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market sputtered to an indecisive close on Thursday, pausing after three straight days of losses.Small-company stocks, which have slumped 10 percent from their peak in early July, recovered the most.Thursday\u2019s pause followed what has been tough spell for the market, including a 238-point drop for the Dow Jones industrial average on Wednesday and its weak performance in September. The buying may have reflected people entering the market to take advantage of the recent declines, a trend of buying on the dip that has kept the market rising all year despite various geopolitical shocks and worries about Europe\u2019s flagging economy.Stocks had been sharply lower most of the day, only to recover in the last couple of hours of trading. The Dow had been down as much as 130 points.\u201cPeople have been waiting a long time to get back in,\u201d said Aaron Jett, an equity strategist at Bel-Air Investment Advisors. The September decline \u201ccreated an entry point for the cash on the sidelines to start buying again.\u201dThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was effectively unchanged on the day, rising one one-hundredth of a point to close at 1,946.17. Technically, the S.&P. 500\u2019s ever-so-slight gain let it avoid a fourth straight day of declines, which would have been the first time that has happened since December 2013.The Dow fell 3.66 points, or 0.02 percent, to 16,801.05, and the Nasdaq composite rose 8.11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,430.20.The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-company stocks, gained 1 percent. \u201cPeople are willing to dip their toes back in,\u201d Mr. Jett said.Airline stocks made a modest recovery after sliding on Wednesday. United Continental rose 66 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $46.13, Delta Air Lines was up 38 cents, or 1 percent, to $35.28 and JetBlue rose 34 cents, or 3 percent, to $10.59. The airlines fell sharply on Wednesday on fears that the news of the first diagnosed case of Ebola in the United States might curtail demand for travel.\u201cConfirmation of a case of Ebola in the U.S. has joined a growing list of bad news stories with geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Hong Kong, and growth concerns around China and Europe,\u201d Niall King of CMC Markets said in a commentary.Even with Thursday\u2019s slight gains, the general direction of the stock market in recent weeks has been down. The biggest point of concern for investors has been Europe, and that concern flared up again on Thursday.European stock markets sank after Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, said the bank would keep interest rates at record lows and start a bond-buying program to help increase economic demand. The details of the program were limited, prompting investors to sell stocks across the Continent.Germany\u2019s DAX index lost 2 percent, France\u2019s CAC-40 index fell 2.8 percent and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 fell 1.7 percent. Some of Europe\u2019s riskier stock markets, including those in Spain and Italy, were down more than 3 percent.Economic weakness in Europe has been a problem for American investors for several weeks. American companies sell goods globally, and if Europe\u2019s economic slowdown were to continue, it could hurt their profits.Wall Street had one bit of positive economic news. The number people seeking unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 287,000, the lowest level in more than eight years. Over all, 2.3 million people are receiving unemployment benefits, the fewest since June 2006.Investors are waiting for the September employment report on Friday from the Labor Department.

{"Headline": "Hong Kong Wealth Gap on Display in Protests", "Date": "2014-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The normally gridlocked thoroughfare in front of the main Lamborghini dealership here is now quiet and carless. Guests at the $600-a-night Mandarin Oriental hotel had to enter through a lowered metal security gate on a few recent evenings, and several jewelers and luxury handbag shops are temporarily shuttered.China is grappling with a political problem in part because Hong Kong is dealing with an economic one. Underlying the current unrest in Hong Kong, an affluent city of 7.2 million that was a British colony for 155 years before it was returned to China in 1997, is a widening wealth gap.Growing closer to China has brought a bonanza to Hong Kong\u2019s finance, trade, retail and real estate industries. Despite this, average wage growth in the city has stagnated for years, while the costs of housing and daily goods have surged.Hong Kong\u2019s silent minority of elite tend to fall in line behind the Beijing leadership on political or economic policies that touch the city. Now, it appears to be largely the squeezed middle class, and a younger generation discovering its political voice, driving the unprecedented demonstrations that have shut down major routes in some of Hong Kong\u2019s busiest districts over the past week.China\u2019s leaders \u201chave ignored the man on the street for so long because everyone told them Hong Kong people aren\u2019t interested in politics, that it\u2019s all about business, and they haven\u2019t realized that society has clearly changed,\u201d said Fraser J.T. Howie, a co-author of \u201cRed Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China\u2019s Extraordinary Rise.\u201d\u201cEven if protests just fizzle out, that\u2019s not a victory for Beijing, and I don\u2019t believe by any means it puts the democratic genie back in the bottle,\u201d Mr. Howie said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a maelstrom of governance for a long time to come.\u201dHow Beijing chooses to respond to the sweeping protests is complicated by Hong Kong\u2019s role as a major financial center for China. While the city\u2019s economic output has diminished compared with China\u2019s spectacular expansion over the years, it remains a particularly important gateway for foreign investors.Nearly two-thirds of mainland China\u2019s foreign direct investment, which has been in decline this year, is channeled through Hong Kong. And Chinese companies raise a significant amount of funding on the city\u2019s stock exchange.Despite the tensions, Hong Kong so far has seen only limited economic fallout from the protests. Dozens of banks were forced last week to temporarily close a few branches, offices or A.T.M.s. The local stock index fell 2.6 percent for the week, which was shortened by a two-day holiday. The temporary shuttering of some luxury shops was expected to hurt sales in Hong Kong during mainland China\u2019s weeklong National Day holiday, which began Wednesday and traditionally has brought a huge influx of shoppers. Those closures may cost retailers as much as 2.2 billion Hong Kong dollars in lost sales, or around $280 million, for the month of October, according to Raymond Yeung, an analyst at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.China temporarily suspended visas for group tours on Wednesday, a move that could have additional effects on hotel and restaurant receipts in the city. Such tours account for about 30 percent of all mainland visitors to Hong Kong.The broader economic risk is that the situation on the streets deteriorates further and, in a worst-case situation, the authorities respond with the use of greater force or even call in the Chinese military, the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Not only would that hurt the financial interests of Hong Kong\u2019s influential tycoons and prompt a potential relocation of multinational companies away from the city, it would have far-reaching effects for China\u2019s own economic development.\u201cSuch a turn of events would do irreparable damage to Hong Kong\u2019s special status as a regional financial center, which owes much to the city\u2019s strong rule of law, its transparent legal system, and its reputation as a safe place for expatriates to live and do business,\u201d Gareth Leather and Julian Evans-Pritchard, analysts at Capital Economics, wrote Friday in a research report.Hong Kong has been a useful economic hub for distant rulers ever since the British established a trading colony here in 1842, a concession won from the Chinese after the First Opium War. But for Beijing, Hong Kong has proved far more financially vital than it ever was to London. Since Deng Xiaoping began opening China\u2019s economy to the world more than three decades ago, the city has played a crucial role as a place for Chinese companies to raise funds, and as a model for the mainland\u2019s economic and financial overhauls.\u201cHong Kong has been acting as a reference point for China \u2014 whatever they want to do, they come to Hong Kong to take a look first, and if it is good they pick it up,\u201d said Li Kui-Wai, an associate professor of economics and finance at the City University of Hong Kong. \u201cIn a sense, they are trying to catch up with us.\u201dBeing at the center of this give-and-take with China has proved immensely profitable for Hong Kong\u2019s elite, who have voiced few objections to Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the city. The result has been that Hong Kong\u2019s tycoons have increased their dominance over the sectors of the city\u2019s domestic economy that produce the biggest and steadiest profits. That includes utilities, telecommunications, transportation, shipping, logistics, even supermarkets and convenience stores \u2014 but most of all, real estate.That wealth is not getting spread around. Real wages in Hong Kong have risen less than 3 percent in the past decade. Over the same period, home prices have more than tripled. As a result, Hong Kong\u2019s official Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, has risen from 0.518 index point in 1996 to 0.537 point in 2011, the most recent data available \u2014 among the highest in the world for a developed economy.\u201cHong Kong is supposedly an open window to the world for China,\u201d said Heman Cheung, 24, one of hundreds of protesters who camped out in the middle of the street last week in Causeway Bay, one of the city\u2019s busiest shopping districts. \u201cMonopolies control everything, and I don\u2019t see any ceiling on how high they can go.\u201d\u201cThey control the destiny of the economy in Hong Kong,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cIf we just ignore their interests, the Hong Kong capitalism will stop.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Doubts Linger as HP Poises for a Split", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen Hewlett-Packard\u2019s chief executive, Meg Whitman, announced this week that the company would split, she said the two new companies would be \u201ca lot more nimble, a lot more focused.\u201dWould that it were so easy.\u201cNimble\u201d and \u201cfocused\u201d are hardly the first words that come to mind at the mention of HP. \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201chapless\u201d are more like it. HP has lurched from one strategic plan and ill-fated acquisition to the next under a rapid succession of chief executives and board members.To her credit, Ms. Whitman has brought some desperately needed stability since taking over in 2011 after the brief but disastrous tenure of L\u00e9o Apotheker. HP\u2019s stock has nearly tripled since bottoming in November 2012. But at nearly $35 a share this week, it\u2019s still far from the peak of over $53 that it reached during the tenure of Mark Hurd, who is now co-chief executive of a rival, Oracle.In spinning off its computer and printer operations into one unit, to be called HP Inc., which will use the HP logo, and putting everything else into another, called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the company is joining what\u2019s shaping up to be a corporate stampede toward spinoffs. In the last week and a half, eBay, where Ms. Whitman spent a decade as chief executive, said it would spin off its PayPal unit, and the software and information management company Symantec said it would split into two companies. This year is now on track for 66 or more corporate spinoffs, according to Joe Cornell, who follows spinoffs as president of Spin-Off Advisors in Chicago and publisher of a newsletter, \u201cSpin-Off Research.\u201d This year is likely to top the record of 66 spinoffs reached in 1999 and 2000, the peak of the technology bubble, according to Mr. Cornell\u2019s calculations.The surge in popularity has been fueled by activist investors and hedge funds pushing for breakups as well as academic research supporting the notion that the parts are often more valuable than the whole. A study by two Pennsylvania State University professors, James Miles and J. Randall Woolridge, of 174 spinoffs from 1965 to 1994 found that the stock prices of those companies rose an average of 76 percent in the five years after they were spun off, compared with a 31 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. And they found that spun-off companies were three times more likely to be acquired.\u201cDifferent businesses may need different capital structures and more entrepreneurial management,\u201d Professor Woolridge said this week. \u201cThe spun-off company will often be totally different from a culture standpoint. It can get a better board that understands the business and can get the capital structure right. We found that the spun-off companies tend to grow revenues and profits faster.\u201d HP also noted that the two new companies would have distinct customer bases, which they can now focus on, and will rank as the 48th and 49th largest corporations in America.Still, the averages mask the wide variation in performance among companies that have been spun off. For every Motorola Mobility, the cellphone maker spun off by Motorola in 2011 and promptly acquired by Google (and then Lenovo), there\u2019s a Delphi, spun off by General Motors in 1999 only to end up in bankruptcy six years later.So where is HP likely to fall on the spectrum? The prospects have some analysts worried. \u201cIt\u2019s debatable that HP is doing this from a position of strength,\u201d Toni Sacconaghi, a senior technology research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, told me this week. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t inspire much confidence.\u201dInvestors initially cheered the news, but on further reflection, they seemed to share Mr. Sacconaghi\u2019s reservations. HP shares rose nearly 5 percent after the announcement on Monday, but by Thursday, they were lower than before the news was disclosed.Mr. Sacconaghi noted that many of the most successful spinoffs have involved separating slow- (or no-) growth commodity businesses from higher-growth, more entrepreneurial operations. Time Warner and News Corporation are among the media companies that have spun off print operations, hoping to achieve higher multiples and stock prices for faster-growing cable, film and digital media properties. Those recent examples have yielded mixed results so far, with shares in both News Corporation (the print operation) and Fox lagging the S.&P. 500. Time Inc. shares have dropped over 4.6 percent since they were spun off in June, trailing the S.&P. 500\u2019s slight gain. But Time Warner shares have outperformed, gaining over 8 percent.HP\u2019s strategy doesn\u2019t fit the slow growth-fast growth paradigm since both of the new companies have been slow- to no-growth operations. Personal computers and printers, the core of the new HP, are perceived as mature businesses. HP Enterprises, in theory, should be the faster-growing, more entrepreneurial of the siblings. But in the most recent year, HP\u2019s revenue from personal computers has been growing faster than its enterprise businesses.Especially worrisome to several investors I spoke to is the decline of HP\u2019s Itanium server business, where service contracts and maintenance operations generate significant revenue and profit. The installed base of Itanium servers is dwindling as customers replace them with cheaper alternatives. In August, HP reported an 18 percent decline in revenue for its business critical systems unit and a 6 percent drop in enterprise services. By contrast, a bright spot in HP\u2019s results was personal systems, which includes personal computers, where revenue was up 12 percent. HP said that viewed broadly, personal technology could again be a growth business, with HP at the forefront.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t fit the playbook of your typical spin out,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said. \u201cHere the growth profiles really aren\u2019t that different.\u201dAnd there are risks. HP will lose economies of scale, which was one of the main reasons the company gave when it reversed its decision to spin off its personal computer business just three years ago.\u201cThere really are synergies in distribution and sourcing,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said. He noted that when HP reversed its decision, it cited a potential loss of synergies amounting to as much as $1 billion. Adding printers may enable HP Inc. to maintain greater scale, and \u201cmaybe they can mitigate the damage,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said. \u201cBut even if it\u2019s half that, that\u2019s still 5 to 6 percent of their operating profits.\u201dMoreover, it\u2019s unclear how HP Enterprises will finance growth once it loses the cash flow from personal computer and printer sales.There\u2019s also a whiff of desperation surrounding the plan. HP was rumored to be interested in acquiring Rackspace to gain a foothold in trendy cloud-based computing services, a field now dominated by Amazon and Google. But nothing came of that. There was talk HP might acquire another aging technology giant, the data storage provider EMC (which is under pressure from activist investors to spin off one of its own units, the software maker VMware.) Nothing concrete has materialized. (An HP spokesman declined to comment on any potential deals.)Something could still happen. HP said it possessed material nonpublic information, so a large deal could be in the works. That has made investors nervous given HP\u2019s dismal track record, most recently its disastrous $11.7 billion acquisition of Autonomy. (Still unresolved are HP\u2019s claims that it was defrauded when it bought the British software maker in 2011.)But what alternative to a spinoff did HP have? Now in the third year of her original five-year recovery plan, with promised growth in 2016 looking increasingly elusive, Ms. Whitman needs an exit strategy. \u201cThe market didn\u2019t indicate any confidence in the status quo,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said. \u201cHP was already the cheapest technology stock in the S.&P. 500 based on a price-to-forward earnings basis. How can it get any worse? With two separate teams crafting a vision, maybe Wall Street will gain confidence and valuations will go up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Most Ambitious Environmental Lawsuit Ever", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "In Louisiana, the most common way to visualize the state\u2019s existential crisis is through the metaphor of football fields. The formulation, repeated in nearly every local newspaper article about the subject, goes like this: Each hour, Louisiana loses about a football field\u2019s worth of land. Each day, the state loses nearly the accumulated acreage of every football stadium in the N.F.L. Were this rate of land loss applied to New York, Central Park would disappear in a month. Manhattan would vanish within a year and a half. The last of Brooklyn would dissolve four years later. New Yorkers would notice this kind of land loss. The world would notice this kind of land loss. But the hemorrhaging of Louisiana\u2019s coastal wetlands has gone largely unremarked upon beyond state borders. This is surprising, because the wetlands, apart from their unique ecological significance and astounding beauty, buffer the impact of hurricanes that threaten not just New Orleans but also the port of South Louisiana, the nation\u2019s largest; just under 10 percent of the country\u2019s oil reserves; a quarter of its natural-gas supply; a fifth of its oil-refining capacity; and the gateway to its internal waterway system. The attenuation of Louisiana, like any environmental disaster carried beyond a certain point, is a national-security threat.Where does it go, this vanishing land? It sinks into the sea. The Gulf of Mexico is encroaching northward, while the marshes are deteriorating from within, starved by a lack of river sediment and poisoned by seawater. Since 2011, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has delisted more than 30 place names from Plaquemines Parish alone. English Bay, Bay Jacquin, Cyprien Bay, Skipjack Bay and Bay Crapaud have merged like soap bubbles into a single amorphous body of water. The lowest section of the Mississippi River Delta looks like a maple leaf that has been devoured down to its veins by insects. The sea is rising along the southeast coast of Louisiana faster than it is anywhere else in the world.The land loss is swiftly reversing the process by which the state was built. As the Mississippi shifted its course over the millenniums, spraying like a loose garden hose, it deposited sand and silt in a wide arc. This sediment first settled into marsh and later thickened into solid land. But what took 7,000 years to create has been nearly destroyed in the last 85. Dams built on the tributaries of the Mississippi, as far north as Montana, have reduced the sediment load by half. Levees penned the river in place, preventing the floods that are necessary to disperse sediment across the delta. The dredging of two major shipping routes, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, invited saltwater into the wetlands\u2019 atrophied heart.Beneath the surface, the oil and gas industry has carved more than 50,000 wells since the 1920s, creating pockets of air in the marsh that accelerate the land\u2019s subsidence. The industry has also incised 10,000 linear miles of pipelines, which connect the wells to processing facilities; and canals, which allow ships to enter the marsh from the sea. Over time, as seawater eats away at the roots of the adjacent marsh, the canals expand. By its own estimate, the oil and gas industry concedes that it has caused 36 percent of all wetlands loss in southeastern Louisiana. (The Interior Department has placed the industry\u2019s liability as low as 15 percent and as high as 59 percent.) A better analogy than disappearing football fields has been proposed by the historian John M. Barry, who has lived in the French Quarter on and off since 1972. Barry likens the marsh to a block of ice. The reduction of sediment in the Mississippi, the construction of levees and the oil and gas wells \u201ccreated a situation akin to taking the block of ice out of the freezer, so it begins to melt.\u201d Dredging canals and pipelines \u201cis akin to stabbing that block of ice with an ice pick.\u201dThe oil and gas industry has extracted about $470 billion in natural resources from the state in the last two decades, with the tacit blessing of the federal and state governments and without significant opposition from environmental groups. Oil and gas is, after all, Louisiana\u2019s leading industry, responsible for around a billion dollars in annual tax revenue. Last year, industry executives had reason to be surprised, then, when they were asked to pay damages. The request came in the form of the most ambitious, wide-ranging environmental lawsuit in the history of the United States. And it was served by the most unlikely of antagonists, a former college-football coach, competitive weight lifter and author of dense, intellectually robust 500-page books of American history: John M. Barry.\u2018What took 7,000 years to create has been nearly destroyed in the last 85.\u2019Barry\u2019s research for \u201cRising Tide\u201d had made him an amateur expert on flood prevention, and in the days after Hurricane Katrina, he received requests from editors and television-news producers for interviews. He accepted nearly every one of them and within days of the storm had become one of the city\u2019s most visible ambassadors in the national press. \u201cI felt I had an obligation,\u201d Barry told me, \u201cto convince people that the city was worth rebuilding.\u201dLike many others, Barry was frustrated that he couldn\u2019t figure out why New Orleans had flooded so catastrophically. When he studied the numbers \u2014 the wind shear on Lake Pontchartrain, the storm surge, the inches of rainfall \u2014 they didn\u2019t add up. After making calls to some of his old sources, he concluded that the levees hadn\u2019t been overtopped, as officials from the Army Corps of Engineers assumed, but had collapsed because of design flaws. (He was among the first to draw attention to this fact in an Op-Ed article published in The New York Times that October.) Barry concluded that just as in 1927, people died because of cynical decisions made by shortsighted politicians drawing on bad science. For Barry, Hurricane Katrina was not the story of a natural disaster; it was a story of politics, science and power.It seemed like the ideal basis for a John Barry book, but Barry decided not to write a book. Instead, on the cusp of his 60th birthday in 2006, he entered public life. He wrote editorials for The Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post and USA Today. He joined state committees charged with improving flood control. He called a friend in Congress who sat on the Appropriations Committee and met with other lawmakers and their staffs. He toured flood-management systems in the Netherlands. He began to resemble Andrew Humphreys, a conflicted hero of \u201cRising Tide,\u201d who arrived in New Orleans in 1850 to study flood control: \u201cThe work obsessed him, unbalanced him, pushed him to the margin. He stopped writing . . . because it distracted him. . . . He himself talked to reporters. He basked in their attention, basked in their portrayal of him as a major figure.\u201dIn Washington, where Barry lives for part of the year, he met with a freshman representative from the state\u2019s First Congressional District, which includes much of southeastern Louisiana: Bobby Jindal. He begged Jindal to demand action from the White House. New Orleans couldn\u2019t count on its mayor, or on the governor, he said; the city needed a hero on Capitol Hill. After speaking for two hours, Barry recalled, Jindal said that taking a leadership position on Hurricane Katrina \u201cdidn\u2019t fit his timing for running for governor.\u201d (Jindal, who declined to comment for this article, was elected governor in 2007.) \u201cI left in total disgust,\u201d Barry said.Barry has a special talent for disgust. His face at rest conveys a pained forbearance. A lifetime spent studying the behavior of powerful people motivated by low ambitions has made him quick to skepticism. He is a master of winces, grimaces and exasperated smiles. His voice is gravelly and low, though indignation amplifies it fivefold. At 67, Barry is 5-foot-9 and powerfully built \u2014 he participated in national weight-lifting competitions as recently as 1998. He played football at Brown and, after dropping out of a Ph.D. history program, joined Tulane University\u2019s football team as a receivers\u2019 coach. In his office in downtown New Orleans, the most prominent wall decoration is a laminated Times-Picayune newspaper from 1973 that celebrates the first Tulane victory over Louisiana State in 25 years. When discussing his public battles, he often summons football metaphors. \u201cWriting is pretty isolated,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoy the action. I like to fight.\u201dIn the miasma of incompetence after Hurricane Katrina, Barry\u2019s intellectual gravity and combativeness elevated him rapidly in the public trust. When the Louisiana Legislature created a regional levee board, Barry was urged by several local leaders to apply for a seat. The board \u2014 the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East, or Slfpa-E \u2014 would be responsible for overseeing all flood-management projects in its jurisdiction, which includes nearly all of New Orleans. Because the continued existence of the city depends on its ability to manage floods, this was no small responsibility. Some of the nation\u2019s leading experts on flood protection were appointed to the board, among them California\u2019s flood-plain-management chief, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the marine scientist responsible for one of the first efforts, in the late \u201880s, to restore coastal Louisiana. Barry was appointed in 2007 and functioned as the board\u2019s spokesman.Barry was curious to see how the past would inform the decisions about the city\u2019s future. Like many historians, he is fond of quoting George Santayana: \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d But he never quotes Santayana without quoting Hegel: \u201cThe only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history.\u201d For Barry, the battle for New Orleans\u2019s survival would be fought along the Santayana-Hegel axis.Although the board had questions about the quality of the levees being rebuilt around the city, of far greater concern was the condition of the marsh south of New Orleans. As the marsh disappeared, even weak storms would inundate the city, no matter what condition the levees were in. The board realized that it was focusing on the wrong thing: The marsh, not the levees, had to be the priority. The board soon found itself pushing most aggressively for work as many as 75 miles south of New Orleans.The state did have a plan in place to rebuild the barrier islands and coastal wetlands. Originally published in 2007 and revised in 2012, the so-called Coastal Master Plan was endorsed by scientists, as well as the oil and gas industry. It listed 109 flood-risk-reduction and land-building projects that, if executed in the next half-century, would \u201ccreate a sustainable coast\u201d; some land loss would still occur, but not nearly as much as currently projected. The state estimated that these projects would cost $50 billion. (A Tulane University study estimated the cost at $94 billion.) The state, however, had not figured out how it was going to finance the Coastal Master Plan. The main source of funding would be the settlement from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil-spill lawsuits, which is expected to be as much as $20 billion. That would leave about $30 billion.Barry believed that other oil and gas companies should also contribute. His argument was simple: Because the industry conceded responsibility for 36 percent of land loss, it should pay its part: $18 billion would be a start. The industry, unsurprisingly, preferred that the master plan be funded by taxpayers. \u201cIndustry recognizes its role,\u201d Chris John, the president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, a lobby that represents the major energy conglomerates, wrote in an editorial published in The Times-Picayune. \u201cHowever, our idea of a solution is very different than that of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East.\u201d (In an email, John claimed that \u201cthe scientific consensus is that controlling the Mississippi River through the levee system is the primary reason for wetland loss, not canals and wells.\u201d)Barry did not believe that the industry would willingly contribute billions of dollars to coastal restoration. But he wondered whether it had any legal obligation to fund the master plan. When it ice-picked the marsh, did it break any laws? Barry thought it had. He knew that nearly every company that has operated in the marshes since the 1920s has used permits obliging them to maintain and repair any environmental damage it caused. In 1980, Louisiana began adhering to a federal law that required companies operating in the marsh \u2014 a list that includes ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Shell, BP, Chevron and Koch Industries \u2014 to restore \u201cas near as practicable to their original condition\u201d any canals they dredge. After consulting with legal experts, Barry became convinced that most companies never filled in their canals and that the state had failed to enforce the law. In fact, many of the projects listed in the Coastal Master Plan called for plugging canals that should have been restored years ago.\u201cThe reality is that our case is overwhelming,\u201d Barry told me. \u201cYou look at the photographs of the damage, and you say, What the heck?\u201d (This and the following quotation are paraphrases; indignation not only raises the volume of Barry\u2019s voice, it also makes his language unfit for print.) \u201cAre you out of your mind? They violated the terms of their contract. They broke the law!\u201dThe levee board couldn\u2019t enforce the law. But Barry believed that there was one way around its impotence: It could sue every single oil and gas company that had scarred the marsh in the last century. The complexity of such a case would be daunting, baroque. Lawyers would have to determine who dug every foot of the 10,000 miles of canals and pipelines and then quantify, in dollars, the extent to which each endangered New Orleans\u2019s flood defense. The academic centers and environmental groups Barry contacted, while sympathetic to the cause, lost interest when they estimated how many millions of dollars would have to be spent on expert witnesses and coastal surveys. \u201cWe didn\u2019t only need legal ability,\u201d Barry said. \u201cWe needed the resources to take on Exxon, Shell, Chevron and BP \u2014 all at once.\u201dHe compiled a list of private lawyers who have had success bringing major environmental lawsuits. It was a very short list. The first name on it was Gladstone N. Jones III, an attorney based in New Orleans who in 2006 won the largest judgment against the oil industry in the history of Louisiana: $57 million in damages for pollution and marshland loss caused by ExxonMobil. Jones, who resembles a midcareer Fred Gwynne and has the deep, cajoling voice to match, didn\u2019t need to think long about taking the case. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty easy one to try, because the damage is so clear,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a case where the industry acknowledges damage in their own papers. The science is irrefutable. The cause is irrefutable. The oil companies didn\u2019t fill in the canals. Why? Because it cost money.\u201dJones\u2019s team of coastal experts, biologists and lawyers ultimately concluded that 97 corporations violated their permits over the last century. They hoped, perhaps quixotically, that after filing their lawsuit, other parishes and levee boards across the state would join the effort, with the goal of achieving a larger settlement with the entire industry. Barry thought the New Orleans levee board would serve as a \u201cheat shield\u201d to absorb the industry\u2019s furor, providing other parishes the cover to file their own lawsuits. And cover was needed \u2014 there was no precedent for an environmental lawsuit of this scope and complexity. \u201cThere are few cases of this type in American history, where an environmental injury produced such significant human risk,\u201d said Oliver Houck, a Tulane law professor who specializes in environmental law. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing out there like this \u2014 not in the extent of the damage or the extent of the compensation claimed.\u201d Jones couldn\u2019t think of any precedent either. \u201cNew Orleans and the greater area will largely disappear over the next 50 years if nothing is done,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not lawyer talk or political talk. It\u2019s reality.\u201d\u201cFrom now on,\u201d one of his lawyers said when they convened afterward, \u201cI\u2019m going to have my interns start my car.\u201d Everyone laughed, except Jones. \u201cThis is going to get dirty,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat are they going to do?\u201d Barry asked. \u201cNot buy my next book?\u201dJones figured there would be a period of quiescence while the industry decided how to respond. Within hours, Jindal, who was in Aspen, Colo., at a meeting of the Republican Governors Association, released a statement. \u201cThis is nothing but a windfall for a handful of trial lawyers,\u201d Jindal said, arguing that the suit came \u201cat the expense of our coast and thousands of hardworking Louisianians who help fuel America by working in the energy industry.\u201dThe fight over the lawsuit had entered a new phase. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised that Jindal opposed the suit,\u201d Barry said, \u201cbut I was surprised by what happened next.\u201d\u2018There\u2019s nothing out there like this \u2014 not in the extent of the damage or the extent of the compensation claimed.\u2019Barry did not expect the support of Jindal, who has received more than $1 million in campaign contributions from the energy industry. But he did expect that Jindal would respond in a spirit of \u201cmalevolent neglect\u201d \u2014 that Jindal would publicly oppose the lawsuit while grudgingly acknowledging his constitutional inability to block it. Jindal, after all, has been under pressure to fund the Coastal Master Plan, which he has promoted as \u201cthe largest effort in the nation to protect and restore a coastal landscape.\u201d He had already directed state officials to commit every dollar of funding for the Restore Act \u2014 a federal law dedicating 80 percent of the fines paid by BP under the Clean Water Act \u2014 to the master plan.A number of people close to the proceedings have said there were indications that some of the defendants were amenable to a settlement. Louisiana\u2019s attorney general, Buddy Caldwell, suggested that discussions about a settlement were underway. A one-time contribution to the master plan might benefit the industry\u2019s image and resolve any uncertainty about liability for coastal land loss. \u201cThey want to get all this stuff off their books,\u201d Caldwell, referring to the energy industry, said on a local radio show. \u201cAnd I believe after this legislative session, we\u2019re going to see some big-time movement.\u201dLand in 1984Land in 2014HoumaLaroseDulacGolden MeadowCocodrieGrand IsleTerrebonneBayPort FourchonLa.New OrleansLosses since 1984Land in 2014 with losses highlightedLand in 1984Land in 2014HoumaGolden MeadowTerrebonneBayLa.Port FourchonLosses since 1984Land in 2014 with losses highlightedLand in 1984Land in 2014HoumaLa.Land in 2014 with losses highlightedLosses since 1984HoumaLa.Land in 1984Land in 2014Land in 2014 with losses highlightedLosses since 1984But soon after the lawsuit was announced, Jindal, who is widely expected to run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, indicated that he would go to unusual lengths to ensure that a settlement would never be negotiated. The nine-person levee board had been designed to gather experts and insulate them from political meddling. Now Jindal declared that he would refuse to appoint any candidates who supported the lawsuit. \u201cTo be very clear,\u201d Garret Graves, then the chairman of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, told a local reporter, \u201cthe governor has said that the lawsuit is a litmus test \u2014 period.\u201d As it turned out, the chairman of the independent committee responsible for nominating candidates to the levee board, Jay Lapeyre, was the board chairman of ION Geophysical, a large oil and gas technology-service company.Barry happened to be one of three members who was up for reappointment. Lapeyre began the next nomination meeting in October 2013 by saying he was under no pressure from Jindal\u2019s office, but noted that Barry\u2019s qualifications had to be reconsidered because the lawsuit had thrust him into \u201cthe political world.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any doubt that, except for the lawsuit, John Barry would be a shoo-in,\u201d Lapeyre said. (Lapeyre has since confirmed this account.) The board did not vote to nominate Barry again.In his place and for the other two seats, Jindal selected candidates who opposed the lawsuit and had little or no expertise in flood protection. Barry\u2019s successor was Lambert Hassinger Jr., a New Orleans lawyer whose firm, Galloway Johnson, boasts of representing \u201cseveral of the largest drilling contractors and pipeline-transportation companies in the world, as well as companies engaged in all phases of oil and gas production.\u201d Once these appointments were made, a third of the levee board opposed its own lawsuit.Barry might have concluded that after eight years of public service, it was time to focus his energies elsewhere. His book on Roger Williams had finally been published; for the first time in years, he could consider a new book. Instead, within days of being replaced on the board, he created his own nonprofit group, Restore Louisiana Now. Its mission was to \u201c[preserve] the lawsuit and [prevent] opponents from getting the Legislature to intervene in what should be a court process.\u201d He raised money for gasoline and a part-time assistant and set off on what resembled a statewide book tour, only instead of a book, he promoted the lawsuit. A lobbyist advised him to visit Rotary Club gatherings and the editorial boards of local newspapers. His tour took him to Monroe, near the Arkansas border; Lake Charles, near the Texas border; Houma, Lafayette and Shreveport. More than 300 people showed up at the Rotary Club in Baton Rouge, 60 in Ruston, seven in Chalmette. He delivered a presentation in which he explained the lawsuit\u2019s rationale and showed before-and-after photographs of the marsh. He believed that he was making a difference. \u201cWe take seriously the responsibility we have to protect people\u2019s lives,\u201d he told Rotarians. \u201cBut how can we do that when we don\u2019t have any resources?\u201dThere are 105 seats in the Louisiana House of Representatives and 39 seats in the Senate. During the term, about 70 lobbyists from the oil and gas industry were in the legislative chambers. They worked in concert with the governor\u2019s staff to secure support for a bill that would void the lawsuit. \u201cThey turned on the fire hose,\u201d one veteran energy lobbyist said. \u201cIt was the best organized effort I have ever seen,\u201d another said. Opposing them were 10 lobbyists hired by the law firms representing the levee board and the Sierra Club, which helped finance the effort. They were joined in Baton Rouge by Barry, Gladstone Jones and several other members of the board\u2019s legal team.Despite being so severely outnumbered, having little experience in state politics and being seen as an outsider even by members of his own coalition, Barry remained optimistic. If he could sway hostile crowds at Rotary Clubs, shouldn\u2019t he be able to persuade enough legislators to kill a bill? Besides, legislators didn\u2019t have to come out in favor of his lawsuit; they only had to agree to let the courts, not the Legislature, decide the case. There were other reasons to suspect that he had an advantage too. He had survived a smear campaign \u2014 he was called an \u201cenvironmental extremist\u201d (\u201cThat\u2019s the worst smear they can think of in Louisiana\u201d) and an \u201caspiring author\u201d \u2014 and direct-action campaigns were being staged across Louisiana, criticizing the oil and gas industry\u2019s meddling in state politics. Virtually every newspaper that published an editorial on the issue condemned the state\u2019s effort to kill the lawsuit, including traditionally industry-friendly papers like The Lake Charles American Press, The Houma Courier and Acadiana Business. Three former governors of Louisiana came out in support of the lawsuit, as did a majority of southern Louisianians, by a margin of more than three to one \u2014 at least according to a poll commissioned by Restore Louisiana Now.The intensity of the industry\u2019s lobbying effort seemed to be backfiring, rousing the suspicion of some legislators, particularly those who were practicing lawyers. \u201cIf the industry doesn\u2019t believe the levee authority has any standing to file a lawsuit,\u201d said Representative John Bel Edwards, a Democrat from Roseland who is running to succeed Jindal as governor, \u201cthen they should go to court and file a motion. But rather than go to the courts, they ran to the Legislature. That was the first indication that the levee board\u2019s claims were not frivolous at all, but had merit.\u201d Senator Daniel Martiny, a Republican from Jefferson Parish who opposed the effort to destroy the lawsuit, put it more directly. \u201cThe bottom line is the oil industry has been a big supporter of a lot of people, myself included,\u201d he said. \u201cAt times, I was even one of their heroes. And I had people way up in the oil-industry hierarchy tell me, We know you\u2019re right about this, but we don\u2019t have any other way to stop this.\u201dOne by one, throughout the spring, bills written to kill the lawsuit failed \u2014 more than a dozen in all by the last week of the legislative session. Some of the bills were seen as overly broad, raising the fear that they might endanger the incipient BP settlement; others were voted down over constitutional concerns. In the final week of May, a lobbyist for the lawsuit told Barry, \u201cIf we voted today, we\u2019d win.\u201d\u2018There are a whole lot of people in this state that have raised their children and got their education based on their experience in the oil and gas industry.\u2019While this was going on, oil executives with local political influence showed up in the legislative chambers \u201cto watch, to be muscle,\u201d as the lobbyist put it. The Houma delegation was visited by a senior BP lobbyist. Although Houma is the seat of Terrebonne Parish, one of the most endangered of the coastal parishes, all of its legislators emerged from their conversations in favor of the bill. \u201cYou could feel the weight coming down,\u201d Barry said. \u201cYou could see them getting peeled off one at a time, through threats or promises. It was disheartening.\u201dMany legislators didn\u2019t need to be persuaded. In late May, Senator Robert Adley, a Republican from Benton, told one reporter: \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd to say that the oil and gas industry has damaged the coast. They did what they were told to do.\u201d This is a claim that most industry representatives have not been brazen enough to make. Then again, Adley himself is an industry representative. Since 1993, he has been the owner of the Pelican Gas Management Company, and before that he was the president of ABCO Petroleum for 20 years.Adley is not the only one. State legislator is a part-time job, and many work in the oil and gas industry, too. Representative Gordon Dove, a Republican from Houma who is the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources and the Environment, owns Vacco Marine, which provides vacuum trucks for the cleaning of oil tanks and has received many complaints from environmental regulators. Representative Neil Abramson, a Democrat from New Orleans, is a lawyer who has defended oil and gas companies in environmental-damages lawsuits. Representative Jerome Richard, an independent from Thibodaux, is a sales manager for Byron E. Talbot, a contractor employed by Chevron. Representative James Morris, a Republican, is an independent oil producer from Oil City.But many of these legislators also live in coastal parishes and have watched for years as the lands they represent steadily disappeared. Richard\u2019s district includes Lafourche Parish, which has suffered some of the most extreme land loss in the state, with an especially high proportion of that loss coming from canals dredged by the industry. Richard didn\u2019t like the idea of a bill that would kill a lawsuit already in progress and pledged his support to Barry. But he ultimately decided that such a bill would be constitutional, and everyone else in his delegation opposed the lawsuit, so he went along. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the only one voting against it,\u201d he told me.Adley spoke for many critics of the lawsuit when he said he was convinced that none of the 97 oil and gas companies had done anything illegal. He cited as proof testimony given before a Natural Resources Committee meeting by J. Blake Canfield, an attorney for the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources, who said, \u201cWe do not have any evidence that the permits have been violated.\u201d Canfield, however, also added that the state had not looked into permits older than 1980. Chris John, the president of the L.M.O.G.A., the industry lobby, makes a different argument. The lawsuit, he wrote to me in an email, will endanger the Coastal Master Plan: \u201cLitigation will actually slow the process of addressing coastal land loss. This is a bad result for the community.\u201dI asked Adley whether he thought his position as an oil executive might constitute a conflict of interest. After all, Senator Eric LaFleur, a Democrat from Ville Platte and a lawyer at the firm that represents the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, recused himself from all votes related to the lawsuit for this reason. Adley\u2019s voice sharpened: \u201cI\u2019m elected by the people in my district. They know who I am. They know what industry I\u2019m in. They choose to send me there. It\u2019s their right to make that decision \u2014 not yours, not anyone else\u2019s. People in the oil and gas industry do support me because, yes, I\u2019ve been in the industry and, yes, I understand them. That\u2019s important to them.\u201d He continued: \u201cLet me tell you something: There are a whole lot of people in this state that have raised their children and got their education based on their experience in the oil and gas industry. At one time, 70 or 80 percent of our entire budget and employment came from that industry. If you took all those people out of the government here, you wouldn\u2019t have much left.\u201dOnce it became clear that the bill would pass, some peculiar votes \u2014 or nonvotes \u2014 followed. Abramson, the oil and gas lawyer from New Orleans, declined to vote. Senator J. P. Morrell, another New Orleans lawyer and a Democrat, voted for the bill and later said that he had not been present for the vote and that his machine had malfunctioned. Senator Gregory Tarver, a Democrat from Shreveport, told a pro-lawsuit lobbyist that he had voted for the bill by accident. No one who voted against the bill claimed it was by accident.One peculiarity about the fight over the lawsuit is that few industries are in greater need of coastal restoration than oil and gas. The next major hurricane that hits the Gulf Coast will put at risk billions of dollars of industry infrastructure \u2014 refineries, oil tanks, terminals and pipelines. This is why the industry endorsed the Coastal Master Plan. A second oddity is that Jindal, a hero of the anti-tax faction of the national Republican Party, who last year tried to eliminate the state\u2019s corporate and income taxes, has now put himself in the position of allowing the largest single bill facing his state \u2014 for the balance of the Coastal Master Plan \u2014 to fall almost entirely upon taxpayers.The industry, by trying so strenuously to destroy the lawsuit through an act of the Legislature, may have finally overplayed its hand. \u201cLouisiana has lost a couple of its gods in the last decade,\u201d Oliver Houck, the Tulane law professor, told me. The first god was the Army Corps of Engineers, which once could do no harm. Hurricane Katrina put an end to that. The BP oil spill, and the company\u2019s inept early response in its aftermath, shook local confidence in the industry for the first time in generations. The fight over the lawsuit represents a new milestone. \u201cThere\u2019s been a sea change in public opinion,\u201d Houck said. \u201cI don\u2019t think [the industry will] ever recover the kind of uncritical acceptance that they have enjoyed in Louisiana for the last century.\u201d As Barry said: \u201cThe idea of making the industry live up to its legal responsibility is not going to die.\u201dThe lawsuit, however, might. Gladstone Jones has requested that a federal judge rule on whether the bill signed into law by Jindal is constitutional and indeed restricts the lawsuit from proceeding. Judge Nannette Jolivette Brown of Federal District Court will hear that motion, along with motions filed by energy companies to dismiss the suit, on Nov. 12. At the same time, Jindal continues his effort to replace levee-board members with lawsuit opponents. He has appointed four board members so far, which leaves the board with a slim 5-to-4 majority, at least for now, in favor of its own lawsuit.\u2018The idea of making the industry live up to its legal responsibility is not going to die.\u2019A backup plan would be for the attorney general, Buddy Caldwell, to file a lawsuit on behalf of the state. This is the path advocated by Houck, Representative Richard and many others, but few in the state expect Caldwell to do any such thing. Another possibility is for a group of residents to file a class-action lawsuit demanding restitution from the industry. Though no specific path seems as effective as the original lawsuit, Barry remains optimistic. He has spoken privately about his backup plans. He refers to them as Plan B, Plan C, Plan D and Plan E. \u201cPlan F,\u201d he said, \u201cis moving out of New Orleans.\u201dBarry originally pledged not to write about the lawsuit, mainly because so many opponents accused him of having ulterior motives for joining the levee board in the first place. (\u201cI believe that this entire issue is really put together for a few trial attorneys and one guy who\u2019s writing a book,\u201d Senator Adley told me. \u201cToday you and I have had the pleasure of adding one more chapter to his book.\u201d) Barry forced himself not to take notes about his experiences over the last several years to avoid the temptation to write a book.He is now reconsidering. The book would be a kind of sequel to \u201cRising Tide,\u201d about \u201cthe interplay between the river, the sea, politics and oil over the last century.\u201d Though it would \u201cbe about a lot more than the lawsuit,\u201d he said, the story would most likely culminate with the battle to make the industry pay for its share of the Coastal Master Plan. In this climactic chapter, a figure named John Barry would appear on the scene. But John Barry, John Barry insists, would be just a minor character.Nathaniel Rich is a contributing writer for the magazine.Digital Design: Meghan LouttitAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Tactics Threaten Public Funds ", "Date": "2014-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneCorporate tax strategies intended to minimize global taxes, by hook or by crook, are by now standard practice. Google and Facebook move money through Ireland to lower their taxes. Starbucks uses the Netherlands, a practice that is under review by Europe as well.\u201cThe commission picked up a case which is quite common in terms of tax planning,\u201d said Pascal Saint-Amans, who runs the Center for Tax Policy and Administration at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the policy advisory organization of the world\u2019s advanced nations.The question is whether this sort of strategy \u2014 as common to multinational companies as filing a tax return every year \u2014 can truly be stopped. What hangs in the balance is whether governments can continue to tax corporations beyond the barest minimum. Or whether globalization will make such taxation all but impossible.\u201cA combination of greater economic integration and more income accruing to intangibles like intellectual property, which by nature are hard to locate, does raise profound questions for the future of taxation,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and President Obama\u2019s first chief economic policy adviser. \u201cIt is a significant problem for the revenue capacity of states and an immense problem for their capacity to maintain progressive taxation.\u201dIf corporations can continue to evade taxation \u2014 using strategies like sham transactions between phantom subsidiaries to shift profits to the lowest tax jurisdictions and costs to where taxes are highest \u2014 the burden of public finance will land almost entirely on the shoulders of ordinary workers, the only link in the economic chain that can\u2019t move.\u201cConsider a superstar banker, an enormously valuable pharmaceutical patent, a terrific entertainer, an assembly line worker and a teacher. Of all those things, which is the least mobile?\u201d asked Mr. Summers. \u201cA tax system that can\u2019t reach the mobile is a tax system that is going to burden working people.\u201dBut it is highly doubtful that the American political system could raise taxes on dividends, capital gains and upper incomes enough to compensate for the lost revenue from business. Rich taxpayers also have their own sophisticated tools to shield income, including parking money in tax havens around the world.Mr. Saint-Amans said he feared that without the corporate income tax, income taxation would fall apart entirely as the wealthy could avoid taxation by becoming companies, inserting several corporate layers between themselves and their money.Nobody has a confident grasp of the scale of corporate tax avoidance. Corporate tax revenue in the United States today amounts to some 2.6 percent of total economic activity, roughly the same as it did in the early 1980s, when the latest wave of globalization took off.Across the 34 O.E.C.D. nations, corporate tax revenue actually grew from just above 2 percent of G.D.P. in the 1960s to some 3.7 percent in 2007, before the financial crisis walloped companies around the world.These figures can be misleading, though. In the United States, corporate taxes have remained flat despite a sharp increase in corporate profits, which today take the highest share of national income since the government started measuring them in the 1920s. Profits have similarly risen in other industrial countries around the world.Plus, there is plenty of suggestive evidence that profit-shifting has become a core pillar of corporate strategy.In 2012 the Irish subsidiaries of American multinationals generated $120 billion in profit, according to United States government data, eight times as much as their German subsidiaries. Subsidiaries in Bermuda generated $82 billion, four times as much as subsidiaries in Mexico.The problem is global. In 2010, according to the International Monetary Fund, Barbados, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands received more foreign direct investment combined than Germany or Japan. The British Virgin Islands was the second-largest investor in China, after Hong Kong. These fictions are possible because most of the money flows through shell corporations that employ nobody and produce nothing.Can these problems be fixed? \u201cI think so,\u201d Mr. Saint-Amans said. \u201cThe golden age of \u2018We plan aggressively and pay taxes nowhere\u2019 is over.\u201dThe European Commission\u2019s deployment of competition policy to go after dubious tax breaks in Apple\u2019s case is a novel and potentially powerful strategy, which could be applied to many other arrangements.Governments in both the rich and poor world are fed up, Mr. Saint-Amans said. Having spent the last few decades drafting rules to prevent double taxation, they are now terrified that they have built a system of double nontaxation instead.Governments that turned a blind eye to the tax avoidance of their multinational champions to give them a competitive edge against foreign rivals are now under enormous pressure from voters to prove that it\u2019s not only workers and dupes paying taxes.The O.E.C.D., Mr. Saint-Amans says, has no business telling countries what tax rate they should impose. If the Irish can fund their government charging companies 12.5 percent, that\u2019s their business.Still, he trusts new rules developed by the O.E.C.D., if broadly adopted, could put an end to common avoidance practices, like parking valuable intellectual property in tax havens or having subsidiaries in high-tax jurisdictions, where interest is deductible, borrow from subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions where interest is not taxable.Under enormous pressure from the rest of the world, tax havens might even repent. The Irish, he said, have been mulling tightening the rules unilaterally, concluding that the bad blood generated by the arrangements outweighs the modest number of jobs that they lure and the scant tax revenue that these artificial investments leave in the country.There are reasons, however, to remain cautious that the world\u2019s tax collectors can get ahead of its corporate tax strategists.The trend in the United States, if anything, is going in the opposite direction. Despite the Obama administration\u2019s new rules to prevent so-called corporate inversions, where companies move their tax residency abroad, companies like Burger King and Medtronic are still dropping their American \u201ccitizenship\u201d to reduce their tax liability.Ireland has based its entire development strategy on becoming a low tax base for the multinationals of the world. And until the financial crisis walloped its banks, it had been successful.As Mr. Summers pointed out, putting a stop to the shell company shenanigans doesn\u2019t automatically put an end to international tax competition. In fact, it might make it worse.Today companies need move little more than a post office box to gain the benefits of a tax haven. If the rules were tightened so that a company could claim a profit only where it really made it, it might decide to move a lot of operations and jobs there.\u201cThere is the risk that if you require economic substance, you will get economic substance,\u201d Mr. Summers said.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Gladden a Wealthy Mind ", "Date": "2014-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Section: WealthStriking it rich is the American dream, a magnetic myth that has drawn millions to this nation. And yet, a countervailing message has always percolated through the culture: Money can\u2019t buy happiness. From Jay Gatsby and Charles Foster Kane to Tony Soprano and Walter White, the woefully wealthy are among the seminal figures of literature, film and television. A thriving industry of gossipy, star-studded magazines and websites combines these two ideas, extolling the lifestyles of the rich and famous while exposing the sadness of celebrity.All of which raises the question: Is the golden road paved with misery?Yes, in a lot of cases, according to a growing body of research exploring the connection between wealth and happiness. Studies in behavioral economics, cognitive psychology and neuroscience are providing new insights into how a changing American economy and the wiring of the human brain can make life on easy street feel like a slog. Researchers have also identified counterintuitive strategies successful people can use to stave off these negative effects.Make no mistake, it is better to be rich than poor \u2014 psychologically as well as materially. Levels of depression, anxiety and stress diminish as incomes rise. What has puzzled researchers is that the psychological benefits of wealth seem to stop accruing once people reach an income of about $75,000 a year. \u201cThe question is, What are the factors that dampen the rewards of income?\u201d said Scott Schieman, a professor of sociology at the University of Toronto. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t earning even more money \u2014 beyond a certain level \u2014 make us feel even happier and more satisfied?\u201dThe main culprit, he said, is the growing demands of work. For millenniums, leisure was wealth\u2019s bedfellow. The rich were different because they worked less. The tables began to turn in America during the 1960s, when inherited privilege gave way to educational credentials and advancement became more closely tied to merit. Today, says Erik Hurst, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, \u201cthe more education you have, the less time you have for leisure.\u201d This helps explain Dr. Schieman\u2019s finding that \u201cexcessive job pressure, role blurring, when work spills over into nonwork situations, and work-family conflict\u201d have led to a phenomenon he calls the \u201cstress of high status.\u201d He said \u201cthe feeling of always being rushed for time\u201d coupled with an inability to disengage from work allows stress to \u201caccumulate and compound.\u201dLike many overscheduled children, wealthy people tend to fill their leisure time with obligations. \u201cPeople with greater income tend to devote relatively more of their time to work, compulsory nonworking activities (such as shopping and child care), and active leisure (such as exercise),\u201d Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist who won a Nobel Prize in economics for his work on the science of decision-making, and his co-authors observed in a seminal paper in 2006. \u201cBeing wealthy is often a powerful predictor that people spend less time doing pleasurable things and more time doing compulsory things and feeling stressed.\u201dIn addition to external pressures and behaviors, human nature can exacerbate stress. Recent scientific discoveries paradoxically suggest that people can seize more control of their lives and become happier by recognizing that their brains have a mind of their own, leading them to think and act in ways at odds with their interests and goals. Modern executives can gain an edge by seeing their minds as one more thing to manage.An important place to start, according to Sendhil Mullainathan, a Harvard economist, and Eldar Shafir, a Princeton psychologist, is by understanding how the brain responds to deprivation (whether of time or money). \u201cWhen we experience scarcity of any kind, we become absorbed by it,\u201d they write in their book \u201cScarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much.\u201d \u201cThe mind orients automatically, powerfully, toward unfulfilled need. For the hungry, that need is food. For the busy it might be a project that needs to be finished.\u201d As Dr. Kahneman and his longtime collaborator, David A. Schkade, observed: \u201cNothing in life is quite as important as you think it is while you\u2019re thinking about it.\u201d Looming deadlines tend to focus the mind, often inspiring purpose and creativity. But they also capture much of the brain\u2019s finite mental capacity. It presses out other needs, often leading to tunnel vision. A busy executive may want to go out for lunch, take a vacation or see her daughter\u2019s softball game. These breaks might even help her be more effective at work. But her mind naturally focuses on the crisis du jour. \u201cImmediate scarcity looms large,\u201d they write, \u201cand important things unrelated to it will be neglected.\u201d This can generate even more stress. In the modern workplace, where deadlines come like blades on a windmill, one after the other, a singular focus on work can become a way of life. This phenomenon has roots in our evolutionary history, said Daniel J. Levitin, a professor of psychology and behavioral neuroscience at McGill University and author of \u201cThe Organized Mind.\u201d Our ancestors had many challenges, but the perils of information overload and multitasking were not among them. Many modern humans must navigate a Times Square world of constant stimulation with brains that struggle to handle even a few things at once. This is especially challenging for people with high-pressure jobs who spend their days making crucial decisions, Dr. Levitin said. When it comes to energy expenditure, he explained, the brain has a hard time distinguishing between momentous and banal choices. We may consciously understand that deciding where to expand our company is more important than whether to have eggs or cereal for breakfast, but to the brain, a decision is a decision. \u201cEven small decisions burn through neuro-resources at a fast rate,\u201d Dr. Levitin said in a phone interview. Because even money can\u2019t buy more cerebral bandwidth (yet), Dr. Levitin said making important decisions early in the day was an effective strategy for reducing \u201cdecision fatigue.\u201d Also helpful is offloading information and responsibility. This can include tried and true techniques such as prioritized to-do lists. Instead of micromanaging, \u201cpush authority downward,\u201d allowing others to make smaller decisions so you can give more attention to bigger ones. Dr. Levitin, whose first job was being a personal assistant to a wealthy person, said this could include having others filter correspondence and email. And by all means, he said, focus on one thing at a time. \u201cHappy, successful people,\u201d he said, \u201care aware of their limitations.\u201dWhile some researchers explore the stress of high status, others are examining how mind management can help the wealthy get more bang for their bucks. Michael I. Norton, a professor at the Harvard Business School and a co-author of \u201cHappy Money: The Science of Spending Smarter,\u201d noted that many people work long hours because they enjoy their jobs. And the more one earns, the more rational the decision to keep working can seem. But, he said, after people have taken care of their basic needs, money does not buy happiness. \u201cWe are working on a paper based on a survey of millionaires that shows that whether you have $1 million or $10 million in net worth, your happiness is the same,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s bad to accumulate money; it\u2019s that people are focusing on something that doesn\u2019t pay off all that much.\u201dDr. Norton does not blame consumer culture for the misguided pursuit of wealth so much as evolutionary biology. Status, he said, is an important psychological marker; people instinctively compare themselves to those around them. Possessions have long been attractive markers of status because they turn measuring into the relatively simple act of counting. But in terms of happiness, the urge to engage in conspicuous consumption is problematic. It often becomes an insidious loop of dissatisfaction, Dr. Norton explained, because we are wired to \u201cconstantly compare ourselves upward.\u201d\u201cIf I used to fly economy and now I fly business class,\u201d he said, \u201cI start to compare myself to those in first class.\u201dA larger house, faster car and fancier shoes do provide immediate gratification, but the pleasure they bring tends to dissipate quickly. This is rooted in the mind\u2019s natural tendency to adapt, to take what it has for granted, and look ahead, said Thomas D. Gilovich, a professor of psychology at Cornell University. This human capacity for adaptation explains much more than why a new boat sparks fresh desires. \u201cResearch shows that when truly bad things happen \u2014 the loss of a child, or a limb \u2014 it takes most people a surprisingly short amount of time to return to their previous level of happiness,\u201d Dr. Gilovich said. \u201cThis is also true of good things, which is why winning the Pulitzer Prize only makes you the happiest person in the world for a while.\u201dIn response, Dr. Gilovich said, we can exploit other habits of the mind to increase happiness. His research shows that people derive more enduring happiness from experiences than material goods. This response is also rooted in our evolutionary history. \u201cIn the past, being excluded from the group was often a death sentence,\u201d he said. \u201cNowadays, it is easier to go it alone, but we still value experiences because they connect us with other people in ways that material goods do not.\u201dThis helps explains findings that people gain more happiness from spending money on others, rather than on themselves. Experiences can also deliver more happiness because the mind often sees the past through rose-colored glasses. This is why the hot, crowded trip to Disneyland often becomes a warm memory, or people tend to look back nostalgically on a troubled youth. \u201cWe romanticize the past,\u201d Dr. Gilovich said.While science can help people manage their minds, happiness still \u201ctakes work,\u201d said Sonja Lyubomirsky, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, who wrote \u201cThe Myths of Happiness.\u201d \u201cYou have to be intentional,\u201d she said. \u201cFind those things that work to make you happy and engaged, and take into account what research shows as main sources of happiness, such as things that help you grow as a person, connect with other people and contribute to society.\u201dResist the natural tendency to look ahead, she said. \u201cJust reminding ourselves to appreciate what we have, having a sense of gratitude, can make a big difference,\u201d she said.Especially if one wants to be great without becoming Gatsby.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deficit Talk in an Election Year ", "Date": "2014-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThere is one unmistakably good piece of news on the budget deficit this election season, but self-proclaimed deficit hawks in the Republican Party have no grounds to boast about it: Since 2010, the pace of health care spending has fallen dramatically and with it, projected deficits over the next decade and beyond. The slowdown is evident in all major health programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and subsidies to buy insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expected budget savings from 2015 to 2024 come to an impressive $1.6 trillion. Here\u2019s the rub for Republicans. The savings have virtually nothing to do with the draconian deficit-reduction legislation they have muscled into law in the past several years, because those laws, thanks to Democratic resistance, left health care spending basically untouched. Rather, budget experts have attributed the improvement to a combination of economic and policy factors, including the beneficial interplay of private-sector and public-sector health spending under the health reform law. But beyond the improvement in health spending, the notion that today\u2019s lower deficit represents economic progress \u2014 whether proclaimed by Republicans or Democrats \u2014 does not withstand scrutiny. Since 2010, Congress and the Obama administration have enacted four deficit-reduction measures, including budget caps and automatic spending cuts (the \u201csequester\u201d) in 2011 and the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d deal in 2012, which both cut spending and raised taxes. The laws have contributed to a steep decline in the deficit, from nearly 9 percent of the economy in 2010 to 2.8 percent in 2014. A rapid drop in the deficit, however, is precisely what the economy did not need. From 2011 until the middle of this year, deficit reduction actually reduced economic growth and employment below the levels they otherwise would have attained, because private sector investment and consumer spending were too soft and uneven to make up for premature budget tightening. The government sector is currently no longer subtracting from growth, but neither is it adding to it, in large part because constraints in the recent deficit-reduction laws prevent sizable federal investment in infrastructure, education and science. That lack of investment is a squandered opportunity to create jobs and lay the foundation for future growth. Failure to invest also foolishly squanders the opportunity to borrow prudently at today\u2019s low interest rates for investments that could pay off for generations to come. Today\u2019s lower deficit also relies much more heavily on spending cuts than tax increases, an indefensibly lopsided distribution of the fiscal burden. The deficit-reduction law from 2012 raised revenue by ending some of the Bush-era tax cuts for high-income Americans.Those changes were important to collect a fairer share of taxes from the upper reaches of the income ladder, and to help ensure that deficit reduction did not rely disproportionately on spending cuts to programs that benefit middle- and low-income taxpayers. Even with the tax increases, however, about three-fourths of the projected $4 trillion in legislated deficit reduction from 2015 to 2024 will come from spending cuts, while less than one-fourth comes from higher revenues. The budget deficit has come down, but at the expense of a more robust recovery. And future reductions will fall heavily on those less able to shoulder the burden. That is nothing either party should be proud of. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Are Calmer, but Worrying Signs Remain", "Date": "2014-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrading TurbulenceA big rally in early trading Thursday has brought the index to within 3 percent of its all-time high. The spurt of panicky activity followed by a rapid calming over the last week is perhaps best captured by the Vix, an index of expected stock market volatility.But while things have rapidly gone back to normal in the stock market, the bigger shifts in bond and currency markets that caused the momentary sense of panic in the stock market haven\u2019t reversed themselves.Ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds are yielding a mere 2.3 percent, down from 3 percent at the start of the year, a move that normally signals a gloomy economic outlook (and is matched by falling long-term interest rates around the world). Investors continue to expect inflation well below the 2 percent the Federal Reserve aims for, with prices in bond markets implying 1.54 percent annual inflation for the next five years. The prices of oil and agricultural commodities fell sharply from July through early October, and they haven\u2019t rebounded.And markets are now putting significant odds on the possibility that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t increase interest rates in 2015, the way it has long signaled is likely. Futures markets on Thursday were indicating a 31.5 percent chance of no rate increase next year, up from 9.1 percent at the start of October.If you knew only those facts, you would conclude that a slowdown in United States economic growth was underway, and maybe even a new recession. Part of the conundrum, though, is that those trends have occurred despite generally positive signs for the nation\u2019s economy.The last few reports on the job market have been pretty good. Part of the reason the market was up Thursday was that Caterpillar, the construction equipment company that is a bellwether for global economic growth, announced strong earnings and rising expectations for next year.In other words, nothing has happened either in the economic data or anecdotally in the last few weeks to make one doubt that the United States economy remains on a path of gradual improvement. Nothing, that is, other than bond, currency and commodity markets pricing in a more gloomy outlook, particularly in terms of persistently low inflation.Now that markets are calming down and becoming less erratic, that is the bigger, longer-term question that remains: Which of those views will turn out to be correct?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone as the Fright Epicenter", "Date": "2014-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe markets are right to worry about the eurozone, the epicenter of fright last week. Its three big economies \u2014 Germany, France and Italy \u2014 are stuck, each in their own way.There is, in theory, a grand bargain that might shift the malaise. This would involve deep structural changes by Berlin, as well as Paris and Rome; quantitative easing by the European Central Bank to increase inflation; and some loosening of fiscal straitjackets.But such a deal \u2014 hinted at by Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, in his Jackson Hole speech in August \u2014 is unlikely to materialize soon, if at all.In the meantime, the region is being battered by shocks from outside and within. The external shocks are the slowdown of emerging economies, especially China; the dispute with Russia over Ukraine; the Ebola outbreak; and the war against the Islamic State.As if this were not enough, the euro zone continues to inflict wounds on itself. The latest was Greece\u2019s rush to get out of its bailout program. The bond markets reacted by pushing Greek bond yields up last week to such a level that Athens\u2019s ability to stand on its own two feet is off the agenda for the foreseeable future.Meanwhile, an election may be held in Greece early next year. That would probably be won by the radical left Syriza party, which wants to write off half the government\u2019s debts \u2014 and that could cause contagion in Italy, whose debts are 137 percent of G.D.P.So why would the euro zone not adopt Mr. Draghi\u2019s grand bargain? Because the politics is hard.Italy, to be fair, is overhauling its labor market, civil justice system and constitution. But Matteo Renzi, the prime minister, has just published a budget that is light on spending cuts. He is also not doing enough to reduce the government\u2019s debt through privatization.France published a budget last week that pushed back to 2017 a plan to cut its deficit below 3 percent of G.D.P. It is not doing enough to liberalize its labor market or cut the size of its welfare state either.If Rome and Paris were asking for extra fiscal wiggle room to finance investment while cutting current spending, they would deserve support. As it is, their actions could provoke a confrontation with the European Commission on the grounds that they flout euro zone fiscal rules. What is more, the Italian and French actions are causing concern in Berlin. German politicians do not like the idea of rules being broken.Berlin, meanwhile, is digging in its own heels as others try to push it to increase investment spending and overhaul its economy. The government is fixated on balancing its budget next year. This goes further than a so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which legally requires close to a balanced budget.The German people are so convinced that debt is sin that even the S.P.D., the center-left party in the grand coalition, is committed to the balanced budget. Sigmar Gabriel, its leader, said last week there were \u201cno economic policy grounds\u201d to abandon the plan. But he announced sharply reduced growth forecasts for both this year and next, to 1.2 percent and 1.3 percent respectively.Germany certainly needs to increase investment, as its infrastructure is decaying. But it is doubtful how much benefit this would be to other euro zone countries. It might, therefore, be more productive for Germany\u2019s partners to focus on structural overhauls \u2014 in particular, the need to free up its services markets. Almost every craft and profession is covered by a guild, which requires long years of training and keeps competition out of the market. The result is that Germany has high-quality but expensive services.If Berlin could be persuaded to open up its markets, this could eventually be an important source of business for other European Union countries. It could also give German consumers a wider range of cheaper services to spend their money on.The snag is that Berlin does not seem inclined to move on this either, because the guilds are politically well entrenched. It is happier to lecture other countries about how to restructure their own economies than to listen to suggestions about what to do at home.That said, it is still worth trying to break the impasse. One sliver of hope was an initiative announced this month by Mr. Gabriel, the S.P.D. leader, and the French economy minister. They are going to come up with some joint suggestions about how the two economies could reform themselves. But who is going to be the deal maker? Mr. Draghi could play a useful role. But his clout in Germany seems to have declined a bit. Both Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the finance minister, and Jens Weidmann, the head of the Bundesbank, the central bank, have criticized the E.C.B. for some of its unorthodox policies.Donald Tusk, the incoming European Council president, who coordinates the positions of European leaders, does not seem suited to play the same deal maker role as the current president, Herman Van Rompuy. Mr. Tusk does not speak English well and his country, Poland, does not use the euro. That leaves the burden of cutting a difficult deal to Jean-Claude Juncker, who becomes president of the European Commission next month. He had better get to work, and fast.Advertisement"}

Nor is it a dry, fact-filled history of the disaster or an analysis of the technology of oil drilling. The 92-minute movie also leaves it for others to explore the spill\u2019s ecological and environmental impact. There are a few obligatory images of sea birds coated with oil and aerial shots of oil slicks destined for the Gulf Coast. Caught in the middle are people like Douglas Harold Brown, the Deepwater Horizon\u2019s chief mechanic, who was aboard the rig when the explosion took place. Mr. Brown delivers a moment-by-moment account of the disaster, while the screen shows the inferno of billowing smoke and flames. Mr. Brown details how he and the workers on the rig were pressured to eliminate jobs to save money. \u201cEverybody knew\u201d the dangers, he says. \u201cIt makes me feel guilty, because I played along. I knew what I was doing was wrong.\u201d He links that failure to a macho culture in the oil business that glorifies risk-taking. One of the most revealing scenes shows the chief executives of top oil companies answering questions before Congress and sounding like guilty, overgrown boys facing a grade school principal after being caught cheating. In another scene, a smug industry honcho gloatingly surmises that the American thirst for oil is so enormous that if the supply were cut off, the economy would collapse within hours. The film\u2019s portrayal of the trust fund, administered by Kenneth R. Feinberg, suggests that money was mismanaged and cut off prematurely. Many who were promised restitution received one or two small checks, then nothing. Mr. Feinberg, who comes across as highhanded and grandiose, acknowledges that he \u201coverpromised\u201d prompt delivery of relief.Amid the cynicism, evasion and denial, a local hero stands out.

{"Headline": "A Small-Town Gem Near Nashville", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOvernighterIt was Sunday night at the Cork & Cow. Around 6:30, four girlfriends met at the bar to have salads and Champagne and review the weekend. There was a nice hum in the dining room, where six couples had assembled at a long table along the tufted green banquette. At least a few of them had come for the weekly special that February evening: a $20 prime rib dinner and half-price bottles of wine. My sister and I had spent the day in Nashville and just wanted a quick bite, so we popped in to share some brussels sprouts and warm bread that came in a small cast-iron skillet. Service took a while, but no one seemed to mind. This is the pace of the South.The steakhouse is in a two-story brick building on the corner of Main Street and Fourth Avenue South in downtown Franklin, Tenn. It\u2019s not far from the town square, which is marked by a monument to the Confederate soldier, and across from a toy store that sells little wooden pickup trucks and novelties like garlic chewing gum. In recent years, a Starbucks and an Anthropologie have moved in along this five-block stretch. But it\u2019s like a fantasy of small-town Main Street: brick sidewalks and cobblestone crosswalks, antique street lamps alternating with trees along the curb, wood-framed storefronts housing independent businesses, some spanking new, and well-preserved, low-slung buildings from the early 1900s all in a row.Franklin is a Southern gem hiding in the shadow of Nashville, less than 20 miles north. Some call it a suburb of Music City \u2014 and plenty of farmland has been developed into subdivisions, strip malls and office plazas \u2014 but Franklin is a world away, with a history and culture all its own. Founded in 1799 and named in honor of Ben Franklin, the town is speckled with American artifacts, from Civil War bullet holes in the side of an outbuilding at the Carter House to a red brick factory with a tall, skinny chimney that produced Magic Chef stoves until 1959.The 16-block historic downtown and three small residential districts that surround it won National Register of Historic Places status in 1975. It\u2019s the kind of place where names on the slanting gray gravestones in the old cemeteries match the names of today\u2019s prominent businessmen and local track and field stars. Maybe it doesn\u2019t possess Savannah\u2019s sultriness or the pedigree of Charleston, but the tea is just as sweet in the rolling hills of what the people around here call Middle Tennessee.I never would have found Franklin if it weren\u2019t for my sister, Lizzie. She moved here in 2009 with her family when her husband was hired as the head of the middle school at Battle Ground Academy, a private day school that was established in 1889. By now, I\u2019ve visited often enough to see the place evolve and to witness the prosperity that is spilling over from Nashville\u2019s boom times. Big corporations like Nissan have moved into the area, once a purely agricultural economy, bringing enough people and money to support a Whole Foods and tasteful new apartment complexes. And yet the place retains its small-town character \u2014 the population is barely over 66,000 \u2014 and a lovely old horse farm sprawls atop a hill overlooking the football field at the school.Once, while the children were in school and Lizzie had the day off work as a nurse practitioner, we went rummaging around the Second Avenue antiques district, a \u201cdistrict\u201d that\u2019s the size of a postage stamp and spread among an old flour mill and a few houses that date from the early 1900s but draws an international clientele.Among the stalls at the Franklin Antique Mall, opened some 30 years ago, you can find everything from a circa 1940s fat-man cookie jar and good Irish lace to a copper weather vane in the shape of a rooster and a cache of tarnished flatware, some of it sterling. Floors are uneven, ceilings are low, and there is plenty of mustiness, but in the warrens it\u2019s possible to find a treasure. There, up on a high shelf, alongside a couple of wooden buckets, sat a dusty rose pitcher.\u201cCould I see that, please,\u201d I said to the woman with reading glasses on a chain. \u201cWhat, darlin\u2019?\u201d That pink pitcher, please. She brought it down, and lo, it was an authentic Russel Wright, from the early \u201960s, which I could snap up long before it ended up at the nice new shops in Hudson and Rhinebeck and other bustling towns in the Hudson Valley in New York. The price was $50; I offered $25; the woman made a phone call; sold! for $30. (Later I found one of similar vintage on eBay for a starting bid of $79.95.) My sister was a little embarrassed by my haggling. \u201cShe\u2019s visiting from New York City,\u201d said Lizzie to the woman, who went to look for Bubble Wrap.The flea market gold mine is about two blocks from the main square and four blocks from the Franklin Theater, the Art Deco cinema that\u2019s the pride of Main Street. Only a few years ago, the 1937 building was just another small-town movie theater that had gone out of business, become an eyesore and put a damper on entrepreneurial spirit. But the Heritage Foundation of Franklin and Williamson County \u2014 founded in 1967 and a major force in historic preservation \u2014 swooped in, rallied community support, bought the building and spearheaded an $8.7 million renovation. \u201cWe had to reinvent it, not just save it,\u201d said Dan Hays, the former head of the International Bluegrass Music Association in Nashville and now director of the theater. It\u2019s now a 300-seat theater with a full bar, and it screens classic films, hosts society events and books local acts, like Sheryl Crow. \u201cA lot of talent lives in Williamson County. We wanted to take advantage of that,\u201d Mr. Hays said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s spurring activity on Main Street. It\u2019s that pixie dust that changes a community.\u201dThe change is perfectly obvious at Frothy Monkey, a branch of the original coffeehouse in Nashville. Against a backdrop of repurposed wood, exposed pipes and sustainable practices, in a converted house across from the First United Methodist Church, the late-morning crowd reveals a creative class that\u2019s migrated into town. Small groups hatch plans over carrot muffins, a young couple sports footwear from Isabel Marant and Yohji Yamamoto, students from the local O\u2019More College of Design get Americanos to go, and parties of one hunch over MacBooks.\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect life out here,\u201d said John Hermann, the keyboardist from Widespread Panic who moved from New York (with a stop in Oxford, Miss.) years ago and is raising a family here. \u201cPeople are friendly. \u00adPeople have time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd everybody\u2019s a songwriter. The way I meet a songwriter is when my furnace goes out. The Terminix guy, he\u2019s a songwriter.\u201dOf course, there are some who have quit their day jobs. Plenty of the big names who play in Nashville live in Franklin, some out toward Leiper\u2019s Fork. It\u2019s worth taking the 15-minute drive to the village where older folks in Carhartt meet for lunch at the Country Boy Restaurant, and the original Puckett\u2019s Grocery and Restaurant sits behind a single gas pump in all its ramshackle glory.Leiper\u2019s Fork would be a complete time warp except for the housewares shop that sells antique dish cupboards for $1,295, the David Arms Gallery in a converted barn, and the sophisticated security systems of the secluded estates all around. A refugee from New York bought a farm there and now features its fruits at Joe Natural\u2019s Farm Store and Cafe.A few weeks ago, as I was heading back to have dinner with my niece and nephew in Franklin, I took a back road through countryside reminiscent of an English landscape, with cows and streams and stone walls and clouds skimming the tops of the trees. Oh beautiful, for spacious skies, as the song goes.An article on Oct. 26 about Franklin, Tenn., a small town near Nashville, misidentified the instrument that John Hermann plays for the local band Widespread Panic.

{"Headline": "Unequal Societies Give an Incentive for Pushy Parenting", "Date": "2014-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From AmericaParents: The next time your child wants a video-game break even though there\u2019s still homework to be done, or begs for ice cream for the fifth day in a row, there\u2019s an elegant new formula to help you respond. If you live in a relatively equal society, give in. If you live in a gapingly unequal one, crack down: no video games or ice cream!What they found is likely to stir up already frothy parenting debates: Parents take child-rearing cues not only from their own parents and books and cultural osmosis, but also, and perhaps subliminally, from inequality.Specifically, parents have reason to chill out and tend to do so in low-inequality settings, where the chances of becoming homeless, on one hand, or ultrarich, on the other, are low. Conversely, parents tend to turn kids into all-consuming projects in settings where a child can land anywhere on a spectrum of conditions from savage to cosseted, and where parents can influence that landing.Taking a broad historical view, Professors Zilibotti and Doepke argue that the centuries-long trend in parenting styles was the decline of the stern, authoritarian approach. As economies changed and children became more likely to pursue an occupation different from their parents\u2019, child-rearing evolved to be more permissive. In a complex market economy, giving children a freer rein improved their chances of finding the best use for their talents. Or, as the paper puts it, \u201cThe decline in authoritarian parenting is driven by rising economic returns to independence.\u201dBut this trend wasn\u2019t, apparently, inexorable. After a peak of permissive parenting in the relatively low-inequality postwar years, the gap between rich and poor widened again worldwide \u2014 and the trend was especially acute in America. And, Professors Zilibotti and Doepke suggest, parenting styles backtracked in the direction of authority and intrusion. The hours that American parents devote to child care have risen sharply from the mid-1980s, for example. \u201cPermissive parenting is less attractive when the stakes are high,\u201d they write, \u201ci.e., when adult-style behavior is especially important for children\u2019s future success.\u201dThe economists\u2019 own lives jibe with their data. Professor Zilibotti grew up in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, and Professor Doepke in a village outside Hannover in what was then West Germany. In interviews, they each described parents who let them roam freely and showed minimal interest in academic results. When their turn to parent came, each thought they\u2019d be similarly relaxed \u2014 but flute, violin, piano and cello lessons ensued.Oops: they were helicopter parents. Professor Zilibotti is torn between his philosophical belief in laissez-faire child-rearing and the incentives of his era. Of raising his daughter, he said in an email, \u201cI compromise every day (without renouncing some basic principles) with the fact that she will have to live in a certain society that rewards some particular skills and behavior.\u201dThe professors mention, but glide over, the notion that more educated parents find it easier to respond to inequality in this way. For the American poor, saddled with multiple jobs, less likely to have spousal backup, parenting can shift back toward the fierce control seen in traditional societies rather than the strong transmission of values and guidance favored by the educated classes.The paper, \u201cParenting With Style,\u201d is a useful reminder of how historic levels of inequality are reshaping the culture. Its findings mirror those of other observers of this era: that faith in public systems and institutions is plummeting, and that in such times people don\u2019t trust broader society to mold their children. Slowly, the discarded ways of aristocracies return: The rich clutch their young close to protect them from the cruel public world; the poor simply survive.Advertisement"}

The Ebola virus ravaging West Africa has renewed the risk of political instability in a region barely recovering from civil war, United Nations officials said Tuesday, hours after the World Health Organization reported that new cases could reach 10,000 a week by December \u2014 10 times the current rate.The head of the new Ebola Emergency Response Mission, Anthony Banbury, told the Security Council that none of the three most heavily affected countries \u2014 Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea \u2014 is adequately prepared. Only 4,300 treatment beds will be available by Dec. 1, according to current projections, and even those would not have an adequate number of staff members. The acceleration of new cases, if not curbed, could easily overwhelm them.Mr. Banbury painted a picture of substantial need. Only 50 safe-burial teams are on the ground, he said, but 500 are required. They need protective gear and about a thousand vehicles. So far, Mr. Banbury said, the mission has delivered 69 vehicles.\u201cWe are fighting for people who are alive and healthy today, but will become infected by Ebola and die if we do not put in place the necessary emergency response,\u201d he said, speaking by a video communication link from Accra, Ghana, where the mission was established in late September.He went on to say that there is a small window of time before the outbreak expands to levels where it cannot be controlled. \u201cWe either stop Ebola now,\u201d he said, \u201cor we face an entirely unprecedented situation for which we do not have a plan.\u201dA look at the government agencies and private entities that were involved in the case of the first person found to have Ebola in the United States.Mr. Banbury\u2019s remarks to the Security Council came as a United Nations aid worker died at a hospital in Germany. The victim, identified as a 56-year-old Sudanese laboratory technician at the United Nations mission in Liberia, had been responsible for the disposal of medical waste. He fell ill on Oct. 6.Tay\u00e9-Brook Zerihoun, the assistant secretary general for political affairs, said the security situation had already been \u201csignificantly impacted since the outbreak of the disease,\u201d with fatal attacks on health workers in Guinea, local riots fueled by what he called mistrust and misinformation about Ebola, and threats of strikes by health workers in Liberia and gravediggers in Sierra Leone.The Liberian ambassador to the United Nations, Marjon V. Kamara, said that her country\u2019s economy urgently needed restoration and that her compatriots needed to get back to work. \u201cThe more they remain idle, the more the prospects for trouble,\u201d she said.Liberia\u2019s troubles went on for a generation, with a succession of civil wars that finally ended in 2004. Since then, the United Nations has spent more than $8 billion on peacekeeping operations, according to an analysis by the Center for International Cooperation at New York University.Herv\u00e9 Ladsous, the under secretary general for peacekeeping, told the Council that 39 peacekeepers in Liberia were currently \u201cunder quarantine or are being closely watched for possible exposure.\u201dEarlier in Geneva, the World Health Organization\u2019s assistant director general, Dr. Bruce Aylward, told a news conference that the number of new cases could reach 10,000 a week in less than two months, compared with about 1,000 a week during the past four weeks. He also said that as of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed, probable or suspected Ebola cases over the course of the epidemic had reached 8,914, with 4,447 deaths.Dr. Aylward said the health organization was particularly focused on isolating 70 percent of new patients in the next two months and beginning to reverse the tide of the virus.While the United States, Canada and Britain have taken emergency steps to screen international passengers to limit the risk of importing Ebola, most of Europe is still struggling with that issue.In a sign of growing concern about the lack of a plan, the European Union\u2019s health commissioner, Tonio Borg, urged member governments to agree swiftly on a common set of measures.Such measures, Mr. Borg said in a letter to fellow ministers, \u201cwill only be truly effective if applied by concerned member states in a coordinated manner.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the country where Ebola has spread to an area near the border with Ivory Coast. It is Guinea, not Sierra Leone.

They begin in New York before migrating overseas to London, Milan and then finally Paris. Each event has developed its own reputation, however true: New York is populist, London edgy, Milan commercial, Paris artistic.In sheer numbers, New York Fashion Week seems to be the largest event \u2014 with almost 300 runway shows or presentations attended by more than 100,000 people, including buyers, press and invited guests. (Part of the reason it is so large is that it includes men\u2019s fashion shows, which are held at other times of the year in the European fashion capitals.) The New York City Economic Development Corporation reported in 2012 that fashion week contributed $850 million a year to the local economy \u2014 about twice the economic impact of the 2014 Super Bowl, held near New York City in East Rutherford, N.J.New York is also the biggest hit online. Google searches for the term \u201cfashion week,\u201d which has entered the vernacular even in non-English-speaking style capitals like Milan and Paris, skyrocket in the first two weeks of September and then trail off by October just as the European fashion shows are heating up.But while New York may make the most noise online and off, it can\u2019t compare to Milan and Paris in terms of the concentration of high fashion houses. Nearly 40 percent of the top women\u2019s luxury apparel brands shown this season were part of Milan Fashion Week, including Armani, Gucci and Prada. Paris, the grande finale event, was right behind, with 31 percent of the top luxury brands.According to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de la Couture, which organizes the Paris shows, there are just over 5,000 accredited attendees each season \u2014 2,000 of whom are journalists \u2014 although individual brands might choose to invite additional guests.

{"Headline": "For Japan, Small Gesture Holds Great Importance ", "Date": "2014-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The Japanese government has no shortage of issues to worry about \u2014 strengthening a faltering economic recovery and trying to persuade a skeptical public to accept a return to nuclear power. But even with all that, the country\u2019s leaders are devoting their energy to a seemingly small gesture: a hoped-for handshake.That hope has led to weeks of delicate diplomatic maneuverings, with small gestures parsed for deeper meaning. Japanese officials have begun expressing optimism that the meeting \u2014 the first since the men took power \u2014 would take place next month on the sidelines of a regional economic summit in Beijing.Among the promising signs cited by the Japanese side: a recent visit to Tokyo by the daughter of a former Chinese leader who not only met with Mr. Abe, but also sat with him to watch a performance by a visiting Chinese dance troupe.The final negotiations are still underway, so it is difficult to tell if the behind-the-scenes negotiations and emissaries shuttling between China and Japan are about to lead to a breakthrough as the Japanese officials suggest. But political analysts in Japan and abroad said both nations appeared to share a growing recognition that they had too much to lose, both economically and politically, if they did not find some way to get along. Both leaders have come under increasing pressure to contain the damage to their nations\u2019 large economic ties. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry has reported that Japanese direct investment in China dropped by nearly half in the first six months of this year from the year before. And sales of Japanese autos and other products in China are still down, although exports to China\u2019s coveted market have recovered somewhat after a steep drop in the first half of last year brought on by the island dispute. Experts say the two leaders are also loath to be seen as the bad guy in the region or in Washington as they battle each other for influence in Asia.With neither country willing to yield over the islands, some analysts now speak of a new status quo, in which China and Japan essentially agree to disagree while returning to business as usual in other areas.In that case, they said, the standoff could become a permanent feature of the security landscape, with both countries continuing to send ships there to make the point that they are in control, while also taking steps to prevent any escalation. \u201cJapan and China are seeking a new equilibrium,\u201d said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. \u201cThe best we can do now is to keep playing this game, but at a lower level, and to find ways to be less confrontational.\u201dOn Friday, China protested after Mr. Abe sent an offering of a potted plant to Yasukuni to mark an autumn festival, though Japanese officials had said they felt the offering would not affect the negotiations as Mr. Abe did not go in person. However, the biggest sticking point in the negotiations over a meet-and-greet has been how to handle the tense, two-year standoff over the disputed islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in China. The countries have been locked in an almost Cold War-style face-off since the purchase of the islands by Mr. Abe\u2019s predecessor in mid-2012, a move the government said was intended to prevent them from falling under the control of Japanese ultranationalists. Outraged by what it saw as a unilateral move to strengthen Japanese control over islands that it also claims, China began dispatching paramilitary ships to waters near the uninhabited islands and declared an air-defense zone above the islands, setting off an international uproar when it demanded all aircraft entering the area submit flight plans to Chinese authorities. For his part, Mr. Abe has refused to back down, expanding the flotilla of Japanese Coast Guard ships that chase the Chinese vessels in games of cat and mouse near the islands. Japan has also stepped up its patrols in China\u2019s newly claimed air-defense zone, a snub that provoked some close encounters between Japanese planes and Chinese fighter jets.China has been demanding that Japan recognize that the islands are in dispute, something that Japan has so far refused to do for fear of opening the door to further concessions.On Friday, the coveted handshake between Mr. Abe and Mr. Xi seemed to move a step closer to reality as Japan\u2019s Kyodo News agency reported Mr. Abe had shaken hands with China\u2019s No. 2 leader, Prime Minister Li Keqiang, at a dinner for Asian and European leaders in Milan. And last weekend, a top Japanese diplomat visited Beijing in what the Japanese news media said was a trip aimed at negotiating the handshake.The diplomatic efforts to bring together Mr. Abe and Mr. Xi began in July, when Yasuo Fukuda, a former Japanese prime minister, was allowed to meet Mr. Xi. Mr. Fukuda handed the Chinese leader a letter from Mr. Abe, and first proposed the meeting between the two leaders during the coming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.\u201cA month ago, I would have told you a meeting was not likely,\u201d said one high-level Japanese official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cNow, I\u2019d say both countries have come around to seeing it as in their interests.\u201dA Chinese analyst, Wu Xinbo, executive dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, was more equivocal: \u201cIf we see Abe is serious about improving relations with China and taking a more serious and responsible attitude towards the history issue, then that will lead to an improvement in bilateral relations.\u201d Bree Feng contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron, Face of France\u2019s New Socialism", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Around 9 p.m. on a recent weeknight, all the lights in Emmanuel Macron\u2019s cavernous offices at the French Economy Ministry were blazing. A coterie of energetic 30-something aides scurried through the hallways, fingers tapping at their iPhones as stacks of takeout dinners circulated on trays.If not for his aura of authority, Mr. Macron might easily have been mistaken for one of his employees. The 36-year-old former investment banker, whom President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande appointed in August to oversee the economy, had just ended another marathon day of meetings that began at 7 a.m. Yet his tailored suit was unrumpled and his auburn hair still perfectly in place.\u201cWe have a very long day here, but there\u2019s a lot of work to be done,\u201d Mr. Macron said, settling onto a black couch. \u201cFrance is sick,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are facing difficult times. We have no choice but to reform this country.\u201dA decade ago, Mr. Macron might have seemed out of place in these halls of power, which have tended to be run by elder statesmen focused on bolstering the vaunted French welfare state. But as one of the youngest people ever to hold a cabinet position, he has quickly become the face of France\u2019s New Socialism, a pro-business technocrat bent on modernizing the country\u2019s social model.Despite his youth, Mr. Macron has been a major force behind a recent shift by the politically struggling Mr. Hollande toward a more centrist economic policy for France. The economy is essentially stagnant and mired in what Mr. Macron describes as \u201cmass unemployment\u201d \u2014 around 10 percent, just shy of the 11.5 percent eurozone average.As part of the Hollande government\u2019s newly stated resolve, last week it issued a \u201cno austerity\u201d declaration of budgetary independence from the German-led orthodoxy that has been widely blamed for making economic growth hard to achieve in much of the eurozone. Even as it announced 50 billion euros ($63 billion) in spending cuts over the next three years, the government said it would not meet the deficit targets overseen by the European Union until at least 2017.Essentially daring Brussels, the Hollande government indicated it intends to start charting its own economic course, in ways meant to retain many of the country\u2019s social programs, while sharply increasing its global competitiveness.On Monday, news reports suggested that the European Commission might be preparing to censure France when it reviews its new budget. But Simon O\u2019Connor, a commission spokesman, said it was premature to say how Brussels might respond, until after France formally submits the budget, which is expected on Oct. 15.In many ways it is Mr. Macron\u2019s job to help sell the Hollande administration\u2019s new approach \u2014 not only to corporate France but to a French public worried about its future.\u201cFrance is a strong, wealthy country,\u201d he said, citing a strong research and development base, universal education, large foreign investment and world-class companies. \u201cBut we are always obsessed by our own weaknesses,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a French state of mind.\u201dMr. Macron, who worked in New York for a brief stint during his four years as a banker with the Rothschild Group, draws inspiration from entrepreneurial hotbeds like Silicon Valley, which he visited this summer with his wife and three children, basking in what he called its \u201ccrazy, positive, can-do mentality.\u201dStill, even as he means to help Mr. Hollande push an ambitious but politically perilous drive to brand France as a country that is open for business and unafraid of globalization, he does not want his country to lose its innate egalitarian Frenchness.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that killing the French model in order to become the U.K. or the United States overnight is the solution,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a big debate on inequality there, and for our society, a lot of inequality would not be bearable.\u201dThat has forced Mr. Macron to walk a fine line ever since Mr. Hollande rang his cellphone in late August to ask if he would take the job of economy minister.French business leaders cheered the news, seeing in Mr. Macron a new hope for reform. \u201cWe speak a common language,\u201d Laurence Parisot, the former head of the French employers association Medef, said at the time.But there was a wariness bordering on outrage among the most left-leaning Socialists and from unions. They viewed Mr. Hollande\u2019s ouster of Arnaud Montebourg, the former economy minister who had battled big business, and replacing him with Mr. Macron, as a betrayal of the welfare state.\u201cInstalling a banker while our country is suffering from the domination of finance is not a good sign,\u201d said Jean-Marc Germain, a Socialist member of Parliament.It did not help that Mr. Macron made a major faux pas right out of the gate, in a radio interview, referring to the plight of \u201cilliterate\u201d workers at a factory that was closing in northern France, because they would have few other options. The remark, though perhaps well intentioned, deepened an impression that he was out of touch with the Socialist base.The French news media was quick with labels, calling Mr. Macron \u201cthe Right Brain of Hollande\u201d \u2014 a reference to his right-leaning economic influence on the president. \u201cLes Guignols de l\u2019info,\u201d a satirical political puppet show, caricatured Mr. Macron as a crying baby, a swipe at his youth and perceived political inexperience.But Mr. Macron\u2019s supporters say he is no callow upstart.\u201cHe has an amazing expertise, a political mind, and is modern and liberal in his thinking,\u201d said Jacques Attali, an influential French economist and an adviser to several presidents. \u201cHe also wants to fight inequality, and he cares about the impact on civil society.\u201dMr. Macron met Mr. Hollande in 2007 during a party at Mr. Attali\u2018s home, and the two men hit it off. At the time, Mr. Macron had just done a surprising about-face from an early career in academic philosophy, working with the late Paul Ricoeur, an eminent French philosopher who focused on human consciousness. Mr. Macron obtained a master\u2019s degree after partly focusing his studies on Machiavelli, which, he said with a smile, was good background for navigating the power politics of Paris.He entered the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration, the training ground for France\u2019s governmental elite, pausing in 2007 to marry his former high school French teacher, Brigitte Trogneux, who is 20 years his senior. In 2008, he was snapped up by Rothschild, working mainly in Paris, a job that made him a millionaire.When Mr. Hollande ran successfully for the presidency in 2012, he campaigned on a classic leftist platform that promised greater security for the middle class and higher taxes on the wealthy. But behind the scenes, he called on Mr. Macron as an informal adviser to assure the business community that he was also open to reforms that would help companies create jobs and lift France from moribund growth.Mr. Macron\u2019s first move was to urge Mr. Hollande to drop a proposal to tax incomes above \u20ac1 million at 75 percent, warning it would damage France\u2019s image and turn the country into \u201cCuba without the sun.\u201d Instead, Mr. Hollande forged ahead, spending two years trying to burnish his Socialist credentials instead of tackling the reforms that both men knew were needed, Mr. Macron said.As the French economy continued to flag, Mr. Hollande made Mr. Macron his main economic adviser at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in 2012. This time, he pushed the president hard to break with the \u201cold socialism,\u201d helping to draft a so-called Responsibility Pact that increased flexibility in France\u2019s rigid labor market and promised companies \u20ac40 billion in tax breaks in exchange for pledges to do more hiring.Now, what is important, Mr. Macron said, as a late train from the nearby Gare de Lyon rumbled beneath his window, is that France continue to streamline and modernize the welfare state.\u201cFor me being a Socialist today is about defending the unemployed, but also defending businessmen who want to create a company, and those who need jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to shift the social model from a lot of formal protections toward loosening bottlenecks in the economy.\u201dThat will be no easy task. Numerous French presidents have rolled out reform plans, only to fold after the French took to the streets. Last week, thousands marched against Mr. Hollande\u2019s plans to reduce social spending and open the economy to greater competition.What if Mr. Hollande, already the most unpopular president in modern French history, now decides to retreat?Mulling the question, Mr. Macron lifted a glass of Burgundy wine, a pleasure that he permitted himself given the late hour, then grew suddenly serious. \u201cThe deal I had with the president and the prime minister was to deliver. If they decide not to deliver, I will move.\u201dHe continued: \u201cBut I do think that there is a strong conviction that there is no choice but to reform this country. It will probably be painful, and perhaps we will fail in the end. But France will succeed.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister of France, referred incorrectly to the period during which his wife had been his teacher. It was in high school, not first grade. (In French, \u201cPremiere,\u201d or first grade, refers to high school.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Jobless Rate Underestimates the Economy\u2019s Problems", "Date": "2014-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday's EconomistHere\u2019s a riddle for you: How many economists does it take to figure out the extent of slack in the economy?The answer, broadly speaking \u2014 as you\u2019d expect, there was a fair bit of \u201con-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand\u201d \u2014 was that there\u2019s considerable slack, in terms of underutilized resources, in the American economy in general and the labor market in particular.I\u2019ll get into some details in a moment, but first, why is it important to gauge the amount of slack in the economy? For one thing, it\u2019s a critical input into the thinking of the Federal Reserve. They\u2019ve been providing extensive monetary stimulus to the lagging economy for years now, and as the recovery has slowly taken hold, they need to gauge when it would be safe to start pulling back on their support.Second, businesses, governments, employers and investors all need to know how the near-term economy is doing in order to plan for the future, including hiring, sales and budget outlays and receipts.Third, Congress, functional or not, needs to know the level of slack to calibrate temporary policy measures, like extended unemployment insurance benefits or a job-creating infrastructure program \u2014 to offset the slack until the private market is once again firing on all cylinders.There are at least two special factors that are distorting the unemployment rate\u2019s signal. First, there are over seven million involuntary part-time workers, almost 5 percent of the labor force, who want, but can\u2019t find, full-time jobs. That\u2019s still up two percentage points from its pre-recession trough. Importantly, the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t capture this dimension of slack at all \u2014 as far as it\u2019s concerned, you\u2019re either working or not. Hours of work don\u2019t come into it.The second special factor masking the extent of slack as measured by unemployment has to do with participation in the labor force. Once you give up looking for work, you\u2019re no longer counted in the unemployment rate, so if a bunch of people exit the labor force because of the very slack we\u2019re trying to measure, it artificially lowers unemployment, making a weak labor market look better.That\u2019s certainly happened over the recession and throughout the recovery, but it\u2019s been mixed in with a more benign source of labor force exits: the retirement of aging baby boomers. So economists have scurried about trying to figure out how much of the three-percentage-point decline in the labor force participation rate, from about 66 to 63 percent, to attribute to slack and how much to so-called structural (vs. cyclical) factors.You would expect the unemployment rate to correlate negatively with wage growth: tighter job market, faster wage growth. But when people give up the search and leave the job market, if they\u2019re truly out of the labor force, neither working nor looking for work, they shouldn\u2019t be contributing to slack, right?Yet according to the two scholars, they are. The economists found that labor force inactivity correlates consistently with wages, implying that a significant share of those who\u2019ve left the labor force are adding to existing slack.Thus, the answer to my riddle may not be funny, but it\u2019s important and clear: There\u2019s more slack in the American job market than you\u2019d glean from the unemployment rate alone. Moreover, some of those who\u2019ve left the labor market would come back if the jobs were there. Congress won\u2019t help, so it will be up to the Fed to keep pushing until the recovery absorbs a lot more of that slack.Advertisement"}

The problem is that the simple act of opening the i8\u2019s \u201cswan wing\u201d doors brought gawkers running \u2014 that is, if they weren\u2019t already snapping photos, as happened after midnight in Manhattan when I found tourists surrounding the parked i8.The bombastic attitude of, say, a Lamborghini can make passers-by keep their distance. But the i8\u2019s \u201cBack to the Future\u201d vibe drew people, including proponents of green technology, who said they rarely made a fuss over cars.Bystanders, in fact, constantly invoked the DeLorean from the Michael J. Fox movies as they enthused over the BMW\u2019s cinematic shape. The i8 may not have 1.21 gigawatts, but designers created the i8 to thrill and enlighten would-be Doc Browns: Born from the company\u2019s multibillion-dollar investment in sustainable transportation, the i8 was intended to look, drive and even sound like a sports car of the future.As with some other electrified cars, including the Tesla Model S, the BMW\u2019s exclusivity can dampen the feel-good story. At $136,650 to start, and with BMW declining to estimate production totals, the i8 is too rich and too rare to save the planet. But its technology, especially its groundbreaking use of carbon fiber, may influence a global trend to drastically reduce vehicle weight and therefore improve efficiency.That trend is already spotlighted in the i8\u2019s sister car, the distinctive but less breathtaking i3 city car, which at $42,300 is easily the most affordable carbon-fiber-intensive car in history. In both \u201ci\u201d models, the passenger cell is formed of light yet ultrastrong carbon fiber in a patented process that molds components in minutes, rather than over the thousands of hours it once took to craft the material by hand for cars that cost $1 million and more.Even with 7.1 kilowatt-hours of lithium batteries strung below its floor, the i8 weighs 3,455 pounds, about 480 less than a similarly sized Aston Martin DB9 and some 1,200 less than the Tesla. Slashing weight sets off a chain of energy-saving benefits, allowing lighter, less-powerful batteries, engines, brakes and other components to meet the desired level of performance.The BMW happily demonstrated its dual personalities on the street. As for one question: The BMW whips the battery-bloated Tesla in acceleration and agility. (The coming Tesla Model D might end up faster in a straight line, yet the BMW is vastly more connected and engaging everywhere else.) But the BMW\u2019s back seat is purely for luggage or child seats, whereas the Tesla is a spacious luxury car, so the comparison is not green apples to green apples.The i8\u2019s front wheels are driven by a 129-horsepower electric motor and a 2-speed transmission that operate entirely behind the scenes. The rear wheels are served by a 228-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter 3-cylinder (adapted from the Mini Cooper) with integrated electric assist. Using paddles or a console lever, drivers operate a spectacularly quick 6-speed automatic transmission to manage a total of 357 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque.I first toggled up the eDrive mode, which propels the i8 for up to 22 miles strictly on front-drive electricity, albeit at a Prius-like pace of 9.5 seconds to 60 m.p.h. and a top speed of 75 m.p.h.But since the BMW\u2019s all-wheel-drive Sport mode can replenish the battery on the fly (adding one mile of E.V. range for roughly every 17 miles driven), eDrive mode has a philosophical purpose beyond short electric commutes: For modern megacities like London that charge entry fees for internal-combustion vehicles \u2014 and may one day ban them \u2014 hybrids like the i8 could conserve or replenish the battery range to qualify for entry.The BMW defaults to a Comfort mode that maximizes electric efficiency, but automatically blends in engine power when the driver shoves harder on the accelerator. That mode produced the best gas-electric mileage, with gentle driving eking out 38 m.p.g. on the highway.Over several rip-roaring days, the BMW delivered a solid 31 m.p.g. over all, 3 better than the E.P.A.'s combined city and highway estimate. That economy was about 50 percent higher than the 20 m.p.g. I\u2019ve experienced in rival sports cars like the Stingray and Porsche 911.With wall current far cheaper than gasoline, the E.P.A. figures a bigger edge in energy costs. The i8 owner will pay $1,550 a year in electricity and gasoline to cover 15,000 miles, compared with $2,800 for the Stingray and $3,700 for the Aston DB9.The E.P.A. credits the i8 with 76 m.p.g.e. (the electrical equivalent of a gallon of gasoline) in eDrive mode, within sight of the Tesla\u2019s 89 m.p.g.e. The Tesla, of course, can cover roughly 250 miles on batteries alone, while the BMW must sip premium unleaded to raise the total range to 330 miles.But here\u2019s what the Tesla can\u2019t do: keep pace on a track or on twisty roads with Porsches, Corvettes or BMW\u2019s own M3 and M4 \u2014 with fill-ups around every corner and no worries about being stranded with an empty battery. As for the cabin, it\u2019s clear that BMW wanted the i8 to feel like an everyday sports car, with no intimidation factor.Reminiscent of the 6 Series, the interior is intimate and luxurious, including enviro-friendly leather and a 10.2-inch iDrive screen, but one could quibble that the cabin doesn\u2019t match the avant-garde dazzle of the exterior. The efficiency-coaching digital driver\u2019s displays are cramped and not terribly exciting. Available blue seatbelts that match the two-tone exterior trim add some sci-fi flair.With efficiency runs out of the way, it was time to pivot open the featherweight doors, climb over the awkward sills (falling into the car is almost easier) and admire the performance. What I couldn\u2019t admire was the electric motor under the hood. If the i8\u2019s lowercase name recalls an iPhone, the car mimics one as well: Officially, the sealed hood can be opened only by technicians. And there\u2019s barely enough storage in the cabin for that iPhone.Perhaps it\u2019s better to imagine that a profligate engine is under the hood. Step on the i8\u2019s throttle, and after a beat of turbo lag, you\u2019re whisked into motion like sauce in a blender, propelled by 420 pound-feet of electric-boosted torque. Abetted by the stellar transmission, upshifts unleash a crackling barrage that you\u2019d swear was old-school internal combustion. In reality, the BMW pipes a synthesized simulation of engine noise through door speakers to complement the exhaust soundtrack. It sounds so incredible \u2014 like a Porsche flat 6 hooked to a humming flying saucer \u2014 that you\u2019d never know a miniature 3-cylinder was doing the work.Initial handling impressions were less positive: omnipresent understeer and a relative shortage of tire grip. The 20-inch tires are indeed much narrower than typical sports car tires, helping to save fuel.But my impressions rapidly changed: The faster you go, the more the BMW balances out, with beautifully quick steering and rock-solid poise aided by a lengthy 110-inch wheelbase. The brakes feel strong and natural by the standards of hybrid cars, though their regenerative function makes them touchy in low-speed traffic.For some electric-car fans, one i8 number that\u2019s out of balance is the price, which on the test car reached $138,650 with one option, a $2,000 Giga World leather package. But the i8 is at once an auto-show exotic, a technological tour de force and a BMW. Anyone who expected it to sell for the price of a Chevy Volt, or even the Tesla Model S, was bound to be disappointed.I\u2019ve also heard suggestions that the i8\u2019s design may not age well, because it\u2019s so singular, truly of-the-moment. I think the opposite is true. The most collectible cars of any era are striking, rare, advanced and high-performing, and evoke nostalgia for their specific era.The i8 fits four of those descriptions, with nostalgic yearnings for 2014 yet to be determined. And unlike the notoriously slow and unreliable DeLorean, the BMW is actually a car worth driving.A review last Sunday about the BMW i8 misstated the car\u2019s weight as well as comparisons with two other cars. The i8 weighs 3,455 pounds, not 3,273; it is 480 pounds lighter than the Aston Martin DB9, not 750, and about 1,200 pounds lighter than the Tesla Model S, not 1,400.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Raise Profile of Climate Change for Washington Voters", "Date": "2014-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoney has poured into the handful of legislative races that Mr. Steyer\u2019s political action committee identified as central to shifting the Senate\u2019s leadership from a Republican-led coalition to a Democratic majority that would support the ambitious climate goals set by Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat.About $4.2 million has been spent so far by independent groups on the 10 most competitive state legislative races, up from $3.2 million for the top 10 in 2012 and $1.8 million in 2010, according to state figures. In terms of spending by outside independent groups, this is almost certainly the most expensive legislative election season in state history, the records show.Republicans assert that the heightened focus on climate and the environment could benefit them by sending a message to voters that Democrats are overly focused on the planet and not enough on pocketbook issues.People in both parties say the terrain for discussing environmental goals and climate change in particular has shifted, and in some ways gotten rockier. Addressing the global climate \u2014 unlike, say, local public safety or education \u2014 is profoundly complex with overlapping issues of science and international relations, and few matters that can be addressed with minor tweaks in appropriations or regulations.\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that the campaigns probably wouldn\u2019t be addressing without for this outside money coming in,\u201d said Travis N. Ridout, a professor of government and public policy at Washington State University. \u201cSteyer has sort of forced campaigns to talk about this,\u201d he added, and not all of them willingly. \u201cDemocrats would prefer not to talk about it, and I suspect Republicans would prefer not to talk about it.\u201dGovernor Inslee, a former congressman and a longtime advocate for strong measures to fight global warming, issued an executive order this year directing the state to work with utilities in reducing the use of electricity produced by coal, and to increase the use of alternative fuels in the state government\u2019s fleet of vehicles.A task force is expected to outline legislative proposals next month, after the election, that could include a carbon tax and other strategies to help energy-intensive industries transition from carbon-based energy.Democrats control all statewide elected offices in Washington, and hold a majority in the House of Representatives. But they have been in a pique for two years over the Senate, which was nominally in their control after the 2012 election until two Democrats in their 26-to-23 majority joined with the Republicans. The resulting bipartisan majority coalition of self-described fiscal conservatives has blocked many of Mr. Inslee\u2019s proposals and worked to rein in expensive state programs.So even without Mr. Steyer and his money, made through running a hedge fund, 2014 would probably have been something of a grudge match.With the money, though, climate has been put on the table, if not quite offered as the main course.\u201cWe want to make climate change a local issue,\u201d said a spokesman for Nextgen Climate, Bobby Whithorne.The Republican state party chairwoman, Susan Hutchison, said she thought that argument would backfire with voters in a state that already has one of the most environmentally friendly, low-carbon-emission energy profiles in the nation with its reliance on hydropower. Carrying a climate agenda even further, through measures like a carbon tax on gasoline, natural gas and other products, would hurt ordinary Washingtonians, she said.\u201cWith Steyer\u2019s very radical environmental agenda, we\u2019ve got the possibility of gas costing a dollar more per gallon,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would profoundly hurt our middle-class working families,\u201d she added. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt the people who live like Tom Steyer.\u201dDemocrats, by contrast, say climate change is having a direct impact on regional industries in ways that concern voters, such as reducing oyster harvests by increasing the acidity of the ocean.In addition to Washington State, state legislative contests in Oregon, California and Iowa are recipients of Nextgen Climate spending. But the biggest dollar totals are here, said Mr. Whithorne, the spokesman.Some voter advocates worry that higher spending levels in local legislative elections will turn off voters. At the League of Women Voters of Washington, the group\u2019s president, Kim Abel, said she had heard more concerns expressed this year about money and where it is coming from than ever before.She urged people to vote and not let the money affect them. \u201cYour vote is the only way you make change,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

John Delury, a professor of East Asian studies at Yonsei University in South Korea, said his students, many of them from across Asia, have been riveted by the events in Hong Kong. \u201cI think the impact on young people across Asia could be much bigger than what Beijing anticipates,\u201d he said, noting Hong Kong\u2019s role as regional purveyor of popular culture and a center for international finance. \u201cFrom a soft-power perspective, if anything remotely like what happened in 1989 occurs in Hong Kong, China can kiss its soft power goodbye for a couple of decades.\u201dAdvocates for Tibetans and Uighurs have been especially active on social media, drawing parallels between Hong Kong and the autonomous regions that Beijing established for the nation\u2019s largest ethnic minorities more than six decades ago. \u201cWhat we have in common with the people in Hong Kong is that we are all fighting for freedom and justice against an authoritarian regime that has broken its promises again and again,\u201d Tenzin Jigdal, a Tibetan activist, said in a phone interview from Dharamsala, India, home to the Tibetan government in exile.Those promises include constitutional guarantees that ethnic minorities would have a significant role in managing their own affairs, much as Hong Kong does. In reality, the sprawling autonomous regions set up for Tibetans, Uighurs, Mongolians and other groups are run by ethnic Han Chinese officials appointed by the central government. Most experts outside China agree such entities are autonomous in name only.Although Hong Kong residents still enjoy an uncensored Internet, an independent judiciary and a relatively unfettered press, their complaints echo those that Tibetans and Uighurs have been making for years: about growing interference from Beijing and increasing economic disparity fueled by a surge in wealthier migrants from the mainland.Most analysts agree that events in Hong Kong have already done significant damage to one of China\u2019s so-called core interests: its six-decade effort to bring about reunification with Taiwan. That effort has already run into mounting resistance among the island\u2019s 23 million residents, crystallized last spring when student activists occupied Taiwan\u2019s legislature for nearly a month to protest a trade bill with China. Opponents said the measure, backed by Mr. Ma and his legislative allies from the governing Kuomintang, would have given Beijing too much influence over Taiwan\u2019s economy, which is increasingly dependent on the mainland.Jiho Chang, a leader of the Sunflower Movement, said the combination of Mr. Xi\u2019s remarks and the refusal to give Hong Kong residents the right to elect their leader freely had finally put to rest the notion that Taiwan and Beijing might one day come together under the rubric of \u201cone country, two systems.\u201dIn a phone interview, Mr. Chang laughed when asked if \u201cone country, two systems\u201d still had any resonance among people in Taiwan.\u201cI\u2019m very confident China would break its promises on anything,\u201d he said. \u201cChina claims it wants to bring us closer together, but given what we\u2019ve seen happening in Hong Kong, it has only succeeded in pushing us further apart.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on Monday with an article about the hopes and fears among Tibetans and Uighurs, ethnic minorities in China\u2019s far west, over Beijing\u2019s response to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong described incorrectly Xinjiang, the traditional Uighur homeland.

It was an apparent bid by Mr. Sch\u00e4uble to sell the effort as one way ordinary people might see the rich \u2014 individuals and corporations \u2014 brought to heel.The signing of the accord in Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s cavernous ministry, built for Hermann Goering under the Nazis, capped a two-day meeting of officials from most of the 123 nations that have joined the Global Forum, which evolved from an agreement by Germany and Britain two years ago to crack down on tax evasion and tax fraud.Notably absent Wednesday were Switzerland, known for the secrecy of its banking system, and the United States, which has preferred to pursue its own path in fighting international tax evasion.George Osborne, the chancellor of the British Exchequer, joined other ministers on Wednesday in lauding the relative speed with which the agreement had been negotiated and signed. \u201cTax evasion is a scourge across the world,\u201d he said. The accord \u201cwill reduce the places that tax evaders can hide their money.\u201dA declaration unveiled at the signing ceremony said that \u201cunder the new global standard, a wide range of information will be exchanged on offshore accounts, including account balances and beneficial ownership.\u201d\u201cThe ability of tax evaders to hide is vanishing quickly,\u201d it added. \u201cTax evaders have two choices \u2014 come forward, or be caught.\u201dWith Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain spearheading the effort, other signatories included Singapore, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, several British territories, like the Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands and Gibraltar, as well as the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey.The Italian finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, said the agreement should signal that the international community is capable of cracking down on injustice. It is \u201ca positive response on a global level to the global crisis,\u201d he said.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble and other ministers said the Swiss were expected to join the ranks of the 51 \u201cearly adopters\u201d within months. Switzerland is part of the Global Forum on Transparency and exchanges information for tax purposes, officials said. Forum members are supposed to introduce automatic exchange of taxpayer information from 2018.Despite the United States\u2019 absence from the gathering, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble and others stressed that the Americans had been trailblazers \u2014 with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, known as Fatca \u2014 even if Congress remains wary of international accords.\u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has played a leading part in the effort, emphasized that the United States government was also notably resisting efforts by large American multinational corporations to change their tax residences in order to avoid higher taxes. \u201cThe United States has been a very strong supporter of everything that we are doing,\u201d he said.None of the ministers would estimate how many billions in otherwise unpaid taxes they might now expect to see.But Michel Sapin, the finance minister of France, which has come under intense criticism for failing to hew to European Union deficit norms, noted that catching tax dodgers could also prove a boon to public finances.The ministers said more efforts would be required in the future to ensure that large multinational companies actually pay taxes in countries where they take in revenue. \u201cProfits should be taxed where the real economic activity takes place,\u201d Mr. Osborne said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela, in a Quiet Shift, Gives Foreign Partners More Control in Oil Ventures ", "Date": "2014-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMENE GRANDE, Venezuela \u2014 On a hill overlooking this heat-baked town, a small oil well painted in the national colors of yellow, blue and red gives off a constant whir as it bobs up and down.Crude oil continues to flow through pipes here just as it did 100 years ago, when this became the country\u2019s first successful oil well, setting Venezuela on the path from a sleepy backwater of coffee farmers and cattlemen to one of the world\u2019s most petroleum-rich countries.But today, just a short distance from this landmark oil well, known as Zumaque 1, the streets are unpaved and people live in shacks made from corrugated metal sheets. Even after a century of pumping, the oil is still so close to the surface that it seeps from the ground on its own, a sticky black reminder of wealth amid poverty.\u201cLook at the riches of Venezuela,\u201d said Ram\u00f3n Mater\u00e1n, 64, a laborer, gesturing toward the oozing crude oil that seeped from the ground in his neighborhood, called Baralt 1. Then, looking around the neighborhood, with its potholes and shacks with no sewer connections, he said, \u201cFor all of Venezuela\u2019s riches, things are pretty neglected here.\u201dBut in a quiet change that might surprise many Venezuelans, who have grown accustomed to seeing Pdvsa as a symbol of national sovereignty, the company has been discreetly moving to give more control to foreign oil companies that participate with it in joint ventures, according to five people familiar with recent agreements it negotiated.In the hopes of jump-starting stagnant production through increased investment, the company has signed or is negotiating financing agreements with numerous foreign oil companies operating here. These agreements give the companies greater say over how drilling operations are run and how they buy supplies and equipment, as well as greater control over spending and profits, according to those familiar with them, some of whom asked not to be identified to preserve relations with Pdvsa.But it also included provisions sought by Chevron to guarantee that the new loan, as well as millions of dollars in unpaid dividends from past operations, would be paid promptly from oil revenues, according to an oil industry consultant in Venezuela briefed on the agreement and Mr. Monaldi, who was shown a summary of the contract.The deal also provided for tighter controls over how the loan would be spent and allowed for greater flexibility in running the joint project, they said.Several other oil companies have renegotiated their agreements with Pdvsa along similar lines, several people familiar with the deals said. And while the oil companies remain minority partners with Pdvsa, under terms dictated by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, the new agreements give the companies a greater say in running Venezuela\u2019s oil fields than they have had in years, according to people in the industry. That includes allowing for greater leeway in buying supplies and hiring subcontractors, without going through Pdvsa-controlled subsidiaries, a frequent source of delays and corruption.The recent loan agreements also generally include provisions that would allow disputes to be resolved through international arbitration or in New York courts under New York law, according to the people familiar with them. That is a departure from the operations contracts that govern the joint ventures, which are subject only to Venezuelan law, they said.\u201cThese are contracts signed out of necessity,\u201d said Carlos Bellorin, a senior analyst at IHS Energy, a London consulting firm. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough cash flow to invest in exploration and production or enhancing production in existing projects.\u201dRepeated requests to interview officials at Pdvsa were denied.Mr. Maduro recently removed the longtime head of Pdvsa, Rafael Ram\u00edrez, a favorite of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who ran the company for nearly a decade. But Mr. Ram\u00edrez remained in the government, becoming the foreign minister, and a close lieutenant of his was named to lead the company, suggesting that at least for now there may be no major changes in how it is run.In response to questions about the financing agreement, Chevron said in a statement that it \u201cwill assure cash for on-going operations and new development, as well as distributions to shareholders, including current outstanding obligations.\u201dIf oil is the lifeblood of modern Venezuela, then Mene Grande, with a population of about 21,000, is the place where the heart started pumping.There were earlier attempts to drill for oil in Venezuela, but in 1914 Zumaque 1 (said to be named for the sumac trees that grew nearby) became the first successful well. Drilled by a company that was quickly bought by Royal Dutch Shell, it was also the start of the long reign of foreign oil companies in Venezuela.\u201cA new era in the country starts here,\u201d said Manuel P\u00e9rez Gil, the official historian of the municipality that includes Mene Grande. \u201cWith Zumaque there is a before and an after, from a country that produced cocoa and coffee, we became an oil-producing country.\u201dSoon the country was gushing oil. By 1925, oil made up 41 percent of exports, up from 2 percent in 1920, according to \u201cThe Paradox of Plenty,\u201d a study of oil-producing countries by Terry L. Karl. By 1928, Venezuela was the largest oil exporter in the world. By 1935, oil made up 91 percent of the country\u2019s export income.But oil has been a roller coaster ride for Venezuela. With prices soaring in the 1970s, the country was swimming in oil money, President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez nationalized the oil industry and politicians predicted a golden future. Then prices plummeted in the 1980s, and by the end of that decade riots broke out in Caracas, the capital, incited by hunger and failed expectations.When Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was elected in 1998 the price of oil was less than $10 a barrel. But it would rise to more than $100 and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez used the oil bonanza to finance his socialist-inspired revolution.The Zumaque well was spiffed up for its 100th anniversary on July 31, with a new coat of paint and a mini-shrine to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s revolution. Information panels, like those in a museum, criticize earlier governments for giving too much control to foreign oil companies and credit Mr. Ch\u00e1vez with \u201claying the foundation for true Oil Sovereignty.\u201d\u201cEverything that we have in Venezuela comes from oil,\u201d said Nilson Dur\u00e1n, 49, a cattle rancher who brought a friend to see the well. Taking control of oil fields from foreign companies was Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s most important achievement, he said.Another visitor, Roberto Mor\u00f3n, 40, a partner in a building supply store, said that Mene Grande should have received more from the oil taken from its soil.\u201cThings around here should be a lot better,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many wells here. Mene Grande gives and gives, and it gets nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Push to Get Low-Income Students Through College", "Date": "2014-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDegrees of EducationThe United States fails to do right by most low-income students who excel in school. They overcome long odds and do well enough in high school to show they can thrive in college. Nevertheless, many never receive a bachelor\u2019s degree.Now, though, the country may be approaching something of a turning point.On Tuesday, a handful of institutions will announce an ambitious new effort on this front. Led by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the coalition is setting a specific goal for which it can be held accountable. Today, only about one in three top-performing students from the bottom half of the income distribution attends a college with a high six-year graduation rate (at least 70 percent). Within five years, the Bloomberg coalition wants to raise that to one in every two students.The effort has its roots in a meeting Michael Bloomberg convened a year ago at the Madison Avenue headquarters of his charitable group, according to people who were there. With about 20 experts assembled, he asked how he could have an effect on higher education, beyond his alma maters, Johns Hopkins and Harvard. The group talked about top-performing lower-income students, among other topics, and Mr. Bloomberg ultimately chose them as his initial priority.\u201cIf we really believe that America is the world\u2019s greatest meritocracy \u2014 and I do \u2014 then we can\u2019t sit back and tolerate a situation where so many talented young people who have the grades to get into top colleges are not going to them,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg told me, by email, on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to change that.\u201dAcademic researchers will study the Bloomberg program to see which parts are working, and the group will make later funding decisions based on the findings. Initially, Bloomberg will spend $10 million over two years, and the Heckscher Foundation for Children will add $1 million.Evaluation is certainly crucial. But the biggest question, to my mind, is how colleges will react if they receive substantially more applications from qualified low-income students than today. The Bloomberg effort does not include additional money for financial aid, and its advisers will try to steer students toward colleges that require less debt. So the colleges that admit more low-income standouts will be left with less tuition revenue.Or the colleges will have to find new ways to save and raise money. \u201cNot everything we spend money on is as valuable to academic excellence as need-based financial aid,\u201d said Dan Porterfield, the president of Franklin and Marshall College, who attended the Bloomberg meeting last year.If you\u2019ve been in a sleek new college building lately, you know how true that is.Another possibility is that the outside groups that finance colleges \u2013 including the federal government, state governments and foundations \u2013 will put more emphasis on access. Today, many financial aid dollars flow to relatively well-off families that would send their children to college no matter what. As part of the Bloomberg effort, the Aspen Institute will put together a committee of college presidents and others to study financing, among other subjects.Depending on how you look at it, the new effort is either broad or narrow. It is reaching out to as many as 70,000 students a year and trying to persuade more than 10,000 of them to change their behavior by attending any one of 250 colleges where low-income students graduate at a high rate and with manageable debt. Those colleges include elite private universities as well as state universities like Stony Brook, Iowa, Purdue, North Carolina State, Illinois State and the University of California, Santa Cruz.As big as these numbers are, they clearly represent a small slice of the country. The 70,000 students, for example, make up only about 5 percent of all students from the bottom half of the income distribution. By themselves, they will not solve this country\u2019s issues with education or social mobility.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s trying to reform Italy at a time when low inflation is making the country\u2019s debts heavy and the economy continues to shrink. Failing to remake Italy would very likely result in a Plan B, which could include one of the following: a heavy wealth tax to bring in revenue; a restructuring of the country\u2019s debt; or an exit from the euro. There is no Plan B that would not tip Italy and its neighbors into a severe crisis. That makes it all the more important that Plan A works.Mr. Renzi has been doing a reasonable job since becoming prime minister in February. He has boundless energy and is not afraid of battles. The latest confrontation centers on the labor market, leading to clashes with members of his own center-left Democratic Party and its trade union backers. Last week, Mr. Renzi called a vote of confidence to show he had the support to push the changes through the Senate.He has also begun important overhauls in civil justice, the electoral system and the Constitution. All this is necessary to make Italy a governable country in which businesses want to invest. The snag is that Mr. Renzi is better at announcing changes than delivering them. This is partly a function of Italy\u2019s stifling bureaucracy, which he is trying to kick into action, but it is also because of his own failings.Mr. Renzi, who is only 39, has surrounded himself mainly with other inexperienced politicians. Meanwhile, all key decisions have to go through him. Although a strong drive from the central government may be what is needed to combat vested interests, this approach inevitably leads to bottlenecks. One senior official says the only way to get through to the prime minister is to send him a text message, as requests to his office get bogged down.Mr. Renzi\u2019s next test will be the 2015 budget, which is due to be presented this week. If Italy presents too lax a budget, the European Commission may reject it. That, in turn, may set off a negative dynamic where Rome and Brussels dig their heels in.Italy understandably does not want to tighten the purse strings too much, as this would further crush the economy, which has dipped back into recession. But given that Rome\u2019s debt load is expected to reach 137 percent of gross domestic product at the end of this year, it needs to do everything to maintain credibility with its European Union partners and the markets.There are two obvious ways of squaring the budget circle. One is to fast-track privatization, which would reduce the debt. The other is to crack down on wasteful public spending and thus cut the deficit. The difficulty is that Mr. Renzi seems to be going slow on privatization, and it is not clear whether he will accept the conclusions of the government\u2019s spending review.It is most unlikely that markets will lose confidence in Italy in the short term, even if the budget released this week fails to impress. But Mr. Renzi would have no reserve of good to tap if the Italian economy continues to shrink next year and inflation doesn\u2019t pick up.In such a case, the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio would surpass 140 percent and keep rising. That might lead investors to think that Italy\u2019s borrowing has become unsustainable. The problem is, there would be no easy way to make its debt-level sustainable if confidence vanished.One option would be for a one-time wealth tax. In theory, it ought to be possible to extract several hundred billion euros from the Italian people given their huge wealth. The obstacle is that most of their assets are in property. People who didn\u2019t have ready cash could hardly offer to pay such a tax with a spare bathroom. There might be ways around this problem: for example, persuading banks to offer homeowners mortgages, the proceeds of which could be used to discharge tax liabilities, but the prospect is not palatable.A second option \u2014 restructuring Italy\u2019s debt, to bring it to below 100 percent of G.D.P. \u2014 is even less appealing. Given that it has borrowed over 2 trillion euros, or about $2.5 trillion, more than six times as much as Greece, a default would cause a financial earthquake that would be hard to contain.There would be contagion to other European Union countries, including, perhaps, France. Banks in Italy and elsewhere would have to be shored up, given their large holdings of Italian bonds. The E.C.B. would no doubt throw its protective mantle over the eurozone by buying government bonds and lending to banks. But a default could easily lead to Italy\u2019s leaving the currency bloc, possibly causing the euro to break up.It is therefore important that Italy never needs a Plan B. Mr. Renzi himself can only do so much. The most important card, stimulus by the E.C.B. to push eurozone inflation up, is not in his hands. Nor can he direct Chancellor Angela Merkel to step up German investment, which would help to bolster the eurozone\u2019s growth rate a bit.That said, the way Mr. Renzi plays his own hand will affect the way the E.C.B. and the rest of the European Union play their cards. The more he can show he is capable of delivering change at home, the more his partners will be willing to help him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indian Modernist, Artist of Mystery", "Date": "2014-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Sandhini Poddar first saw the paintings of V. S. Gaitonde, their silence spoke loudly. Displayed in a group show in 1997 at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Mumbai, the large abstract canvases, with layered colors and textures, invited long contemplation. \u201cThis was a feeling that wasn\u2019t ephemeral, it stayed with me, and I could recall it whenever I wanted to go to a place of silence,\u201d she said. Gaitonde, in his early 70s at the time, was living in a one-room rented apartment in New Delhi. Although fellow artists and knowledgeable collectors admired his work, he remained in the shadows, as he preferred. He had friends but never married. He gave few interviews. \u201cHe was a special kind of fellow,\u201d said the New Delhi painter Krishen Khanna, a friend. \u201cHe didn\u2019t doubt himself. He didn\u2019t go around beating his drum. He was very quiet.\u201dLast December in Mumbai, as part of Christie\u2019s first auction in India, a painting by Gaitonde sold for $3.8 million, the highest price ever for a work of modern Indian art. The auction signaled the arrival not only of this singular painter, but also of an entire generation of postwar Indian artists. Almost every work in the sale of Indian modern art fetched a price that was triple its low estimate, said Deepanjana Klein, the Christie\u2019s vice president for South Asian modern and contemporary art. For Gaitonde, it helped that the Guggenheim show was on the horizon. Hugo Weihe, then Christie\u2019s international director of Asian art, told his listeners that the painting they were bidding on might well be displayed in a major New York museum the following year. In the audience was Sandhini Poddar\u2019s mother, Rashmi, an art historian and philosopher of aesthetics. (The Poddars, who are part of the prominent Marwari business clan, had consigned work by another artist.) \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d she texted Sandhini, who was in London, as the gavel descended on the record-setting amount. Her daughter wrote back, \u201cThis is nuts.\u201dThe sale price was certainly startling, but as mother and daughter knew, it could be explained. The growth of the Indian economy over the last two decades has swelled the fortunes of the Indian business class, and with it has come an increased interest in India\u2019s art. The trade in Indian antiquities is tightly restricted; its most fervent collectors are outside the country, in the United States and Europe. Modern Indian art awaited discovery.The leading Indian modernist painters belonged to the Progressive Artists Group, a loose clique of painters that formed in 1947 in Bombay (as Mumbai was then called). They borrowed the techniques and formal devices of avant-garde Western painting. However, as has happened over the ages, the imported aesthetic would change as it was synthesized in India.Gaitonde was raised in Bombay and lived there until his move to New Delhi in 1972. In 1950, he joined the Progressive Artists, painting pictures that were heavily influenced by Paul Klee. \u201cKlee was a great god here,\u201d said Mr. Khanna, who affiliated himself with the Progressive Artists. \u201cEveryone felt he had opened a whole new book in painting.\u201d Gaitonde, who developed a deep interest in the teachings of Zen Buddhism, gradually eliminated all figurative representation from his work. He used a roller to build up thin washes of color in translucent complexity, and a palette knife to create contrasting patches of thick impasto. In 1964, he moved for a year to New York, where he could view actual paintings by Western artists instead of reproductions. Mr. Khanna went with him to visit Mark Rothko. \u201cWe saw Mark doing his big paintings, the black ones,\u201d Mr. Khanna recalled. \u201cWe were both suitably impressed \u2014 Gaitonde greatly impressed.\u201d Although Gaitonde\u2019s paintings don\u2019t resemble Rothko\u2019s formally, they inspire a similar meditative mood. \u201cWhen you concentrate on the painting, you are sucked into the painting,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. In his later years, Gaitonde would apply cutout strips to his canvas and apply his roller over them until they hovered as ghostly forms. He created only a half-dozen or so paintings in a year. Although he could be adamant about his pricing \u2014 Mr. Khanna remembered once seeing the director of the National Gallery of Modern Art approach Gaitonde to suggest a discount, then walk away quickly in obvious defeat \u2014 he showed no interest in material possessions or commercial success. \u201cAfter the work was taken away, he didn\u2019t have any relationship with it,\u201d Sandhini Poddar said. \u201cHe went on to the next idea.\u201dHis dedication to his art and self-imposed absence from the persiflage of casual daily life obviously appeal to Ms. Poddar. \u201cShe lives in a world of abstraction, almost,\u201d her mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the notion of silence, but the experience of silence.\u201d In 2008, Sandhini spent 10 days in a silent retreat at a Buddhist monastery in Massachusetts. On her return, she shaved off all of her long hair. \u201cShe wanted to experience detachment,\u201d Rashmi Poddar said. \u201cOne of the things she was attached to was her hair as a sign of beauty. So she cut it off. \u201d It has since grown back.Sandhini gravitated to the orbit of Rashmi and other art lovers in the family. (A cousin by marriage owns two drawings and a painting in the Guggenheim show.) \u201cWhen other kids were doing cartwheels, I was at the Louvre,\u201d she said. She melded a passion for modern Western art with a devotion to traditional India. Earning postgraduate degrees in ancient Indian culture and Indian aesthetics from the University of Mumbai, she added a master\u2019s in arts administration at New York University.Coming late to art history, she draws on her interdisciplinary studies as a source of insight. Referring to the rich reds and yellows in Gaitonde\u2019s palette and to his calligraphic forms, she said: \u201cWhat aspect of the miniature painting tradition is Gaitonde taking? What part of the Zen tradition?\u201d In her view, medieval Indian art and Eastern philosophy are as relevant as the Progressive Artists Group to an understanding of Gaitonde\u2019s accomplishment. Before taking on Gaitonde for the Guggenheim, Ms. Poddar oversaw exhibitions there on two Indian expatriates: the sculptor Anish Kapoor and (in a show organized by the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles) the printmaker Zarina. With an eye to enlarging its global profile, the Guggenheim is devoting more space to artists from outside the United States and Western Europe. More controversially, as part of its worldwide mission it is establishing a branch in Abu Dhabi. Like New York University, which built a campus there, the Guggenheim has faced criticism over the conditions for construction workers. Acquiring art from the Subcontinent that will be displayed in Abu Dhabi, Ms. Poddar is aware that people from the region constitute by far the largest demographic group, but they are there mainly as temporary workers and may never enjoy the museum\u2019s offerings. \u201cYou have a public to serve, but it is not a museum-going public,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not just enough to put the collection together. Abu Dhabi is so young. At the end of the day, the question is the same: Who are you serving, and how are you going to serve them?\u201dPositioning Indian artists within the overall narrative of modern art is another delicate challenge. In recent decades, many Latin American artists of the mid-20th century have been recognized as central to art history. Will any Indian artists attain comparable status? Rashmi Poddar, for one, is skeptical. \u201cMuch of it is derivative,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Indian art, we\u2019ve always had this love of embellishment and the decorative. Indian art has never been abstract.\u201d Christie\u2019s Ms. Klein, on the other hand, maintains that as more museums explore modern and contemporary Indian art \u2014 she noted exhibitions in Philadelphia, Chicago and San Diego \u2014 the scholarship will deepen, winning wider acclaim for artists. It is not only the scholarship that has a way to go. Within India, the conditions for displaying art are still so undeveloped that Sandhini Poddar was unable to find a financially stable museum that could accept the Gaitonde show. Ms. Poddar lives in England, where she is engaged to marry William Sargent, the co-founder and C.E.O. of a company that creates special effects for movies, \u201cGravity\u201d among them. She is also planning to return to school to get a Ph.D. She seemed confident about Gaitonde\u2019s stature as a world-class painter, but when the topic turned to India\u2019s place in the history of modern art, she became a bit less certain. Asked who stood on the same rung as Gaitonde, she hesitated. \u201cI think he is rather exceptional,\u201d she said. The answer on India\u2019s role in modern art is pending; happily, the scholarship that can settle the question has begun.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Praise, Hillary Clinton Keeps an Adversary Close", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 The two most prominent women in the Democratic Party, whom liberals have cast as potential future rivals, stood backstage and swapped stories about being grandmothers. But Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren, here Friday to rally voters for Martha Coakley, the Democratic nominee for governor of Massachusetts, never appeared on stage together. In fact, relations between the two have been frosty since Ms. Warren began criticizing Mrs. Clinton for being too cozy with Wall Street. Bill Clinton, who campaigned for other Democrats in 2012, declined to appear for Ms. Warren during her Senate race (Mrs. Clinton, as secretary of state, did not engage in political activity).But Mrs. Clinton, who is presumed to be the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has been looking over her shoulder for the past several months and seen a groundswell of support develop on the left for a Warren candidacy \u2014 partly out of frustration that Mrs. Clinton appears too centrist.And so on Friday, Mrs. Clinton officially broke the ice, embracing Ms. Warren verbally, if not physically, and hailing her for the populist approach that Mrs. Clinton is said to lack. \u201cI am so pleased to be here with your senior senator, the passionate champion for working people and middle-class families, Elizabeth Warren!\u201d Mrs. Clinton said upon taking the stage after being introduced by Ms. Coakley.\u201cI love watching Elizabeth give it to those who deserve to get it,\u201d Mrs. Clinton added, speaking slowly and deliberately. \u201cStanding up not only for you but people with the same needs and the same wants across our country.\u201dIn her 25-minute speech, Mrs. Clinton went on to adopt some of Ms. Warren\u2019s populist phrases and ideas, if not her tone.She praised Ms. Coakley for holding \u201cfinancial institutions accountable for the damage they have done to our economy and to individual lives.\u201d She spoke of women and families scraping by on the minimum wage, trying to make it into the middle class and stay in the middle class.\u201cDon\u2019t let anybody tell you that, you know, it\u2019s corporations and businesses that create jobs,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, a variation on a popular Warren theme. Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising, a conservative \u201csuper PAC,\u201d called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remark \u201ca ham-handed attempt to pander to liberal voters\u201d that showed \u201cjust how little she knows about job creation.\u201dMrs. Clinton has been striking similar notes on recent campaign forays around the country, but this was on Ms. Warren\u2019s turf, with her listening in the wings.For her part, Ms. Warren did not have a lot to say about Mrs. Clinton, only that she was \u201chappy\u201d to welcome her back to Massachusetts. But she heaped praise on Ms. Coakley, with classic Warren observations like: \u201cOver and over, she stood up to the big national banks that tried to trick and trap and cheat our families here in Massachusetts.\u201d There has been no love lost between the two since the publication of Ms. Warren\u2019s 2004 book, \u201cThe Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are Going Broke,\u201d written with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi.Ms. Warren writes about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s close ties to Wall Street as a senator from New York and her support for bankruptcy legislation that Ms. Warren opposed. \u201cAs New York\u2019s newest senator, however, it seems that Hillary Clinton could not afford such a principled position,\u201d Ms. Warren writes. \u201cCampaigns cost money, and that money wasn\u2019t coming from families in financial trouble.\u201dAsked what he made of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s overtures here to Ms. Warren, Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University, offered this: \u201cHold your friends close, hold your enemies closer. Certainly, Elizabeth Warren is one of the few people in the Democratic Party she has to fear, and she wants to give every signal that she respects Warren and wants to communicate that Warren will have her ear if she reaches the White House.\u201d Ms. Warren has said she has no interest in being president, but that has not doused the enthusiasm of progressives who want her to challenge Mrs. Clinton. Supporters at rallies are wearing \u201cReady For Warren\u201d T-shirts, a take on the Ready for Hillary super PAC that aims to drum up early support for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s likely candidacy. During the 2008 presidential Democratic primary race, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the economic prosperity of the 1990s, but that approach may not work in 2016. Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters blame some of Mr. Clinton\u2019s policies, namely legislation that allowed the commingling of commercial and investment banks, and trade pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, for contributing to widening income inequality. These same supporters have decried the Clintons\u2019 $200,000 fees for speeches, and excoriated Mrs. Clinton for saying that she and Mr. Clinton left the White House \u201cdead broke.\u201dAlong with her newly populist message, Mrs. Clinton has been making her speeches more personal. She concluded here by noting that she, Ms. Warren and Gov. Deval Patrick had been chatting backstage, trading stories about their grandchildren.\u201cI only had a month\u2019s worth, but I was, you know, trying to keep up with their grandchildren getting ready for Halloween with costumes,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cBut as I was standing there and looking at the smile on Elizabeth\u2019s face as she was describing her grandchildren, and looking at the excitement on Deval\u2019s face as he was talking about his 16-month old,\u201d Mrs. Clinton recalled, \u201cI thought, when it all is said and done, that\u2019s what this is supposed to be about.\u201d Advertisement"}

Two more of the quarter\u2019s better-performing funds also found opportunities in technology, though they didn\u2019t hew to just one index. The J.P. Morgan Intrepid Growth fund invests in any sector where its managers find good growth-oriented stocks. The Matthews Pacific Tiger fund holds shares in companies from across developing Asia.Basking in an Index\u2019s GlowMr. Rogers said the role of a Nasdaq-100 fund in a portfolio varies with tastes and risk tolerance. \u201cIf you\u2019re 25 years old and looking at your 401(k), tilting toward technology can be compelling,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re retired and worried about income, you\u2019ll want to allocate your money differently.\u201d Young adults can afford to make bigger bets, while current retirees tend to favor less risky holdings like bonds and balanced funds. Screening for QualityGilead Sciences shows how they apply those criteria. After their screens flagged the stock, they decided that the market was undervaluing a hepatitis drug, Sovaldi, which has since come to market and is projected to produce sales of $13 billion this year, Mr. Ruhl said. The use of quantitative screens stems partly from the findings of behavioral finance. Research has shown that investors are sometimes irrational \u2014 often they\u2019re overconfident and too reluctant to sell money-losing stocks. The screens help prevent Mr. Ruhl and his colleagues from making these kinds of mistakes, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still this idea that airlines is a bad industry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut management teams have gotten religion on the idea that they need to focus more on profitability and pricing \u2014 if you\u2019ve flown lately, you know prices are up and planes are full \u2014 and that\u2019s produced growth in earnings and revenue.\u201dAt its relatively low price, \u201cthe valuation of Delta was attractive, no matter how we looked at it,\u201d he added.

By many standards, South Korea is already a developed country, with a strong middle class. But AmorePacific is taking advantage of its proximity to China to win customers there, too, Mr. Shroff said. \u201cA growing portion of its business is driven by Chinese demand,\u201d he said.India is a region of special emphasis for the fund \u2014 Mr. Shroff is a native of the country and was educated there. The fund holds more than twice as much Indian stock as its benchmark, the MSCI Asia All Country Ex Japan index. And the Indian market has thrived lately, with India-only mutual funds returning an average of 8.31 percent in the quarter, according to Morningstar. Mr. Shroff also likes investing in India because growth there tends not to be strongly correlated with the rest of Asia or the developed world. \u201cThe Indian economy is two-thirds driven by domestic demand,\u201d he said. Thus, Indian companies can give diversification to the portfolio, insulating it against slumps elsewhere. Another quality that distinguishes this 20-year-old fund is its very low turnover \u2014 recently about 8 percent. Mr. Shroff said that he aims to invest for the long term and not to trade often, but that his low turnover rate has been helped by new money entering the fund. He hasn\u2019t had to sell previous investments just to generate cash to make new ones. Because of the fund\u2019s popularity, it\u2019s closed to new investors. Mr. Shroff\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of just over 1 percent, returned 2.43 percent in the third quarter. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Earnings Drop Before Debut of New F-150", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMark Fields, the automaker\u2019s president and chief executive, called this year \u201cmore of a pit stop\u201d as the company aims to position itself for growth in 2015 and beyond. He acknowledged that \u201cthe third quarter was challenging,\u201d in a conference call with investors Friday.Excluding one-time costs, Ford\u2019s earnings were 24 cents a share for the quarter, down considerably from last year\u2019s. But Ford executives took comfort that they beat Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations, which had predicted the company would earn only 19 cents a share.The automaker predicted it would earn $6 billion in pretax profit for all of 2014 but said it expected to top $8.5 billion in 2015.Perhaps no product is as important to whether Ford will hit that number as the F-150 pickup. It was long the best-selling vehicle in America, but Ford took the significant step of redesigning its flagship truck with an aluminum body to save weight and improve fuel economy. It will begin arriving at dealerships in December. The change required a lengthy shutdown of its truck plant in Dearborn, Mich., to retool, and the company is working with dealers and body shops to train them on the differences inherent in repairing aluminum.\u201cIt is hard to overstate the importance of the F-150 to Ford\u2019s overall health. Perhaps more than any other brand, Ford relies on its iconic truck to drive sales volume and its bottom line,\u201d said Eric Ibara, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cSo while it may win a lot of awards and generate more than its fair share of media buzz, Ford placed a huge bet on its redesign, and the outcome of that bet may be unknown for a while.\u201dIn North America, home of the F-150, Ford\u2019s third-quarter revenue was down 6 percent and sales to dealers down 8 percent, which the company attributed largely to the plant\u2019s five-week shutdown during the quarter. Ford\u2019s overall operating cash flow was negative $700 million for the quarter, for the same reason. (Global revenue was down 2 percent, with sales down 3 percent.)\u201cEveryone knows how profitable the F-150 is to the company,\u201d said Bob Shanks, Ford\u2019s executive vice president and chief financial officer. Once the aluminum truck begins selling, he said, \u201cwe expect it to contribute significantly to the bottom line.\u201dMr. Fields, the chief executive, echoed that sentiment and said plans for the F-150\u2019s introduction were progressing well. \u201cWe now have started mass production,\u201d he said. \u201cThe plant is off and running.\u201dIn addition to issues tied to the F-150, two other factors affected quarterly earnings. The difficult market in South America, as well as currency exchange issues there, continued to weigh on Ford, as it has on other global automakers. But Ford also had higher-than-normal warranty costs, primarily because of recalls in North America.The company reported more than $600 million in charges related to warranty costs in North America in the third quarter, nearly all of it tied to recalls.In September, it recalled about 745,000 sedans and sport utility vehicles in the United States for a problem that could prevent the airbags from deploying in a crash, including C-Max, Fusion, Escape and Lincoln MKZ models.Looking ahead, Mr. Fields said he disagreed with any notion that the auto industry could plateau after what has been a strong sales year. \u201cWe expect this to be a growth industry,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voodoo Economics, the Next Generation", "Date": "2014-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven if Republicans take the Senate this year, gaining control of both houses of Congress, they won\u2019t gain much in conventional terms: They\u2019re already able to block legislation, and they still won\u2019t be able to pass anything over the president\u2019s veto. One thing they will be able to do, however, is impose their will on the Congressional Budget Office, heretofore a nonpartisan referee on policy proposals.As a result, we may soon find ourselves in deep voodoo.And while there was never any admission by the usual suspects that their god had failed, it\u2019s noteworthy that the Bush II administration \u2014 never shy about selling its policies on false pretenses \u2014 didn\u2019t try to justify its tax cuts with extravagant claims about their economic payoff. George W. Bush\u2019s economists didn\u2019t believe in supply-side hype, and more important, his political handlers believed that such hype would play badly with the public. And we should also note that the Bush-era Congressional Budget Office behaved well, sticking to its nonpartisan mandate.But now it looks as if voodoo is making a comeback. At the state level, Republican governors \u2014 and Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, in particular \u2014 have been going all in on tax cuts despite troubled budgets, with confident assertions that growth will solve all problems. It\u2019s not happening, and in Kansas a rebellion by moderates may deliver the state to Democrats. But the true believers show no sign of wavering.But facts won\u2019t stop the voodoo comeback, for two main reasons.Second, the nature of the budget debate means that Republican leaders need to believe in the ways of magic. For years people like Mr. Ryan have posed as champions of fiscal discipline even while advocating huge tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations. They have also called for savage cuts in aid to the poor, but these have never been big enough to offset the revenue loss. So how can they make things add up?Well, for years they have relied on magic asterisks \u2014 claims that they will make up for lost revenue by closing loopholes and slashing spending, details to follow. But this dodge has been losing effectiveness as the years go by and the specifics keep not coming. Inevitably, then, they\u2019re feeling the pull of that old black magic \u2014 and if they take the Senate, they\u2019ll be able to infuse voodoo into supposedly neutral analysis. Would they actually do it? It would destroy the credibility of a very important institution, one that has served the country well. But have you seen any evidence that the modern conservative movement cares about such things?Charles M. Blow is off today. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Women Exit Japan\u2019s Cabinet, in Crisis for Abe", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis month, the I.M.F. slashed its growth forecast for Japan, saying that the blow to consumer spending from an increase in the national sales tax this spring was larger than expected.The resignations are also the first political crisis faced by Mr. Abe, who has enjoyed relatively high approval ratings since taking office in December 2012. Two ministers resigning on the same day because of scandal is unheard-of even in Japan\u2019s often short-lived cabinets, prompting local news media to draw ominous comparisons with Mr. Abe\u2019s first term seven years ago, when he was forced to resign after a series of political scandals.Calls for Ms. Obuchi to step down as trade minister had been growing after revelations that her support groups may have used political funds to treat supporters to trips to a popular theater, and to buy them handkerchiefs and neckties from a boutique run by Ms. Obuchi\u2019s brother-in-law.Opposition lawmakers said such uses of funds could be a violation of laws against bribing voters, an accusation that Ms. Obuchi denied at a news conference on Monday to announce her resignation.Ms. Obuchi, a moderate who was being groomed to one day possibly become Japan\u2019s first woman prime minister, had been given one of the toughest jobs in the Abe government: winning public support for restarting at least some of Japan\u2019s 48 nuclear reactors, idled after the 2011 Fukushima accident.\u201cI sincerely apologize, as a member of the Abe cabinet, for failing to make any contribution to reviving the economy, or bringing about a society in which women shine,\u201d Ms. Obuchi said, repeating one of Mr. Abe\u2019s political slogans.The other woman to step down was Midori Matsushima, who resigned as justice minister after criticisms that she handed out free hand-held fans to supporters, a possible violation of political finance laws that prohibit gifts of monetary value to voters.Despite the apparently small value of the fans, opposition lawmakers had begun calling for a criminal investigation into Ms. Matsushima, saying it was particularly unseemly for a justice minister to violate the laws she was sworn to uphold.Hoping to limit the political damage, Mr. Abe accepted the resignations and quickly appointed two successors, both relatively unknown lawmakers from his governing Liberal Democratic Party. One of the two replacements was a woman, reducing the number of women in Mr. Abe\u2019s cabinet to four.The other three women in his cabinet have also been hit by their own, smaller problems. Eriko Yamatani, chairwoman of the National Public Safety Commission, which oversees the nation\u2019s police forces, has come under criticism for appearing in a photograph with a member of the Zaitokukai, an ultranationalist group accused of hate speech against ethnic Koreans in Japan.The internal affairs minister, Sanae Takaichi, and the minister in charge of gender equality, Haruko Arimura, have also been criticized for their extreme right-wing views.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apologizing to Japan", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 For almost two decades, Japan has been held up as a cautionary tale, an object lesson on how not to run an advanced economy. After all, the island nation is the rising superpower that stumbled. One day, it seemed, it was on the road to high-tech domination of the world economy; the next it was suffering from seemingly endless stagnation and deflation. And Western economists were scathing in their criticisms of Japanese policy.Now, I\u2019m not saying that our economic analysis was wrong. The paper I published in 1998 about Japan\u2019s \u201cliquidity trap,\u201d or the paper Mr. Bernanke published in 2000 urging Japanese policy makers to show \u201cRooseveltian resolve\u201d in confronting their problems, have aged fairly well. In fact, in some ways they look more relevant than ever now that much of the West has fallen into a prolonged slump very similar to Japan\u2019s experience.The point, however, is that the West has, in fact, fallen into a slump similar to Japan\u2019s \u2014 but worse. And that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. In the 1990s, we assumed that if the United States or Western Europe found themselves facing anything like Japan\u2019s problems, we would respond much more effectively than the Japanese had. But we didn\u2019t, even though we had Japan\u2019s experience to guide us. On the contrary, Western policies since 2008 have been so inadequate if not actively counterproductive that Japan\u2019s failings seem minor in comparison. And Western workers have experienced a level of suffering that Japan has managed to avoid. So there are really two questions here. First, why has everyone seemed to get this so wrong? Second, why has the West, with all its famous economists \u2014 not to mention the ability to learn from Japan\u2019s woe \u2014 made an even worse mess than Japan did?The answer to the first question, I think, is that responding effectively to depression conditions requires abandoning conventional respectability. Policies that would ordinarily be prudent and virtuous, like balancing the budget or taking a firm stand against inflation, become recipes for a deeper slump. And it\u2019s very hard to persuade influential people to make that adjustment \u2014 just look at the Washington establishment\u2019s inability to give up on its deficit obsession.As for why the West has done even worse than Japan, I suspect that it\u2019s about the deep divisions within our societies. In America, conservatives have blocked efforts to fight unemployment out of a general hostility to government, especially a government that does anything to help Those People. In Europe, Germany has insisted on hard money and austerity largely because the German public is intensely hostile to anything that could be called a bailout of southern Europe.I\u2019ll be writing more soon about what\u2019s happening in Japan now, and the new lessons the West should be learning. For now, here\u2019s what you should know: Japan used to be a cautionary tale, but the rest of us have messed up so badly that it almost looks like a role model instead. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ireland to Phase Out \u2018Double Irish\u2019 Tax Break Used by Tech Giants", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Ireland\u2019s government on Tuesday responded to the clamorous criticism of its business-friendly tax arrangements by closing a loophole used by multinational giants like Google.The European Union and the Obama administration have been increasingly vocal about the tax-avoidance strategies of multinational companies and the countries that enable them. The European Commission is conducting a broad investigation into the relationships between multinationals and perceived tax havens like Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.In recent decades, Ireland has based much of its economic growth and jobs strategy on its low corporate tax rate and other incentives that enticed foreign companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft and Abbott Laboratories. Joe Tynan, tax partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Dublin, estimates that the loophole collectively saved companies billions of euros, although it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the exact amount.But the change, announced on Tuesday as part of the annual budget statement, won\u2019t necessarily make Ireland any less alluring to companies. For one, the government isn\u2019t touching the country\u2019s tax rate.Critics also point to the type of Irish tax strategies that have enabled Apple to potentially avoid billions of dollars in taxes over the years. Those deals, which are part of the separate investigation by the European Commission, do not appear to involve the tax loophole the Irish government says it will close.\u201cI am skeptical as to how big a deal this really is,\u201d said Crawford Spence, an accounting professor at Warwick Business School in Coventry, England. \u201cIn general, corporations don\u2019t see much legitimacy in corporation tax, and Western countries don\u2019t appear that interested in making them pay it, either.\u201dThe government is phasing out what is known as the \u201cdouble Irish\u201d provision. It allows corporations with operations in Ireland to make royalty payments for intellectual property to a separate Irish-registered subsidiary. That subsidiary, though incorporated in Ireland, typically has its home in a country that has no corporate income tax.Take Google. Its Dublin headquarters are its main hub outside the United States, employing more than 2,500 people. A Dublin-based subsidiary for Google generates revenue, mostly from online advertising, and then pays it in royalties to a separate Google unit that is registered in Ireland but is resident in Bermuda for tax purposes.Reuters reported that Adobe Systems and Yahoo were also among the multinationals with Irish-registered companies that were not tax residents of Ireland.\u201cAggressive tax planning by the multinational companies has been criticized by governments across the globe and has damaged the reputation of many countries,\u201d Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, told the Irish Parliament on Tuesday as part of a budget speech. \u201cI am abolishing the ability of companies to use the \u2018double Irish\u2019 by changing our residency rules to require all companies registered in Ireland to also be tax-resident.\u201dGoogle declined on Tuesday to comment on the specifics of the double-Irish technique.\u201cAs we\u2019ve always said, it\u2019s for governments to decide the law and for companies to comply with it,\u201d Google said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re deeply committed to Ireland and will work to implement these changes as they become law.\u201dApple and Microsoft declined to comment about their Irish tax strategies. Abbott Laboratories did not respond to calls.Dublin\u2019s defending the double-Irish provision has become steadily more difficult in the growing political debate about the tax payments made by multinationals.\u201cI think this is part of an overall drive to try to get international companies to pay more tax,\u201d Mr. Tynan said. \u201cIreland wants to be very competitive, but it has to do that within international rules, and there was a feeling that this was at the boundaries of those rules.\u201dAlong with Ireland\u2019s tax dealings, the European Commission is also investigating Luxembourg\u2019s relationship with Amazon and a finance unit of Fiat, the Italian automaker. The commission is also questioning Starbucks\u2019s tax arrangements in the Netherlands. These investigations are separate from Ireland\u2019s efforts to phase out certain tax policies.At a meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday, European Union officials gave the Irish announcement a cautious welcome. The European Commission, the union\u2019s executive arm, \u201cwill have to look at the details and how it will work in practice,\u201d said Algirdas Semeta, the bloc\u2019s tax commissioner, \u201cbut the intention is a very good one.\u201dA spokeswoman for the Irish Department of Finance said the government did not know how many of the many of 1,100 or so multinationals operating in Ireland use the double-Irish technique.\u201cAs the measure largely relates to companies that are not currently within the scope of Irish taxation because they are not tax-resident here, accurate data on the number of companies affected by this change is not available,\u201d she said, asking not to be identified by name in keeping with the department\u2019s policy.Even as Ireland announced the end of the \u201cdouble Irish,\u201d it indicated that it was interested in creating something akin to an onshore alternative. Mr. Noonan said the government would explore developing a \u201cknowledge development box,\u201d which would provide tax breaks for revenue and royalties derived from intellectual property.Other European nations including Britain and the Netherlands have introduced similar programs or \u201cpatent boxes,\u201d which allow companies based in the country to apply for a lower tax rate on profits that result from certain patents. But Mr. Noonan indicated the Irish version would be \u201cthe best in class\u201d and would offer a \u201clow, competitive and sustainable tax rate.\u201dAnd nothing Mr. Noonan announced on Tuesday would change what has long been one of the biggest sore points for some other countries in the European Union: Ireland\u2019s low official corporate tax rate, which is 12.5 percent. France and other countries with much higher business tax rates have long complained of being undercut by Ireland\u2019s tax policies.The country\u2019s tax regime has helped the government lure foreign investment crucial to Ireland\u2019s now rapidly rebounding economy.Ireland had about 161,000 workers at almost 1,100 international companies in 2013.Approximately half of those companies are American, while about 60 percent of all the combined employees work in industries linked to computer services.Edward D. Kleinbard, a professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, indicated that Ireland\u2019s abandoning the double-Irish provision was \u201ca canny strategic move, because there is already tremendous friction between Ireland and the other members of the E.U. over its extraordinarily low corporate tax rate.\u201d\u201cIn the long term,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s most important to Ireland is to preserve its low corporate tax rate \u2014 not artificial structures that reduce a firm\u2019s tax burden even further.\u201dPatricia Cohen contributed reporting from New York, and James Kanter from Luxembourg.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why China Won\u2019t Keep Growing Fast Forever", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewAn instructor at the International Butler Academy China demonstrates proper wine-pouring technique. China\u2019s economy has grown rapidly in the past few decades, and one consequence is a rise in the number of millionaires and billionaires.There has been plenty of discussion lately about signs that China\u2019s economy is slowing down, focused on details of a possible housing bubble and vast sums of bad loans that the country will have to reckon with. But put aside the challenges China faces this quarter, or next year, and there is one view that is overwhelming: China is a long-term economic juggernaut that will stand astride the global economy in another generation\u2019s time.But what if it\u2019s all hogwash?Many of the most bullish forecasts of China\u2019s economic future are based, more or less, on extrapolation. For more than three decades, its economic output per person has been rising at an extraordinary annual rate of 6 to 10 percent, climbing rapidly toward levels in the richest nations. If that continues for a couple of decades, the bullish forecasts will prove accurate.\u201cChina\u2019s experience from 1977 to 2010 already holds the distinction of being the only instance, quite possibly in the history of mankind,\u201d with sustained super-rapid growth for more than 32 years, they write. \u201cWhy will growth slow? Mainly, because that is what rapid growth does.\u201dBut part of what makes the argument from Mr. Pritchett and Mr. Summers interesting is that they don\u2019t trouble themselves with those gory details of why growth may slow; they say just that the historical evidence suggests it is likely. Maybe concerns about debt levels and bad investments in China will prove justified. Or maybe not. Regardless, we should think that a change is more likely than not.\u201cChina is a huge economy and a profoundly different economy than it was a generation ago,\u201d Mr. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, said in an interview. \u201cBut it would be ahistoric to extrapolate and assume with any high degree of confidence that China will enjoy such extraordinary growth rates over the long term. Economists, strategic analysts, business planners and nervous neighbors should all recognize that a very wide spectrum of economic outcomes is possible over the next generation and that the most likely outcomes involve a very substantial slowing of growth.\u201dThe paper\u2019s authors put it in baseball terms. \u201cIf a hitter has a hot streak with a batting average up 50 points over the past 20 at-bats, then we would forecast a return to the average batting average over the next 20 at-bats,\u201d they write. \u201cIf pressed to say why the batting average would be lower, one could speculate about why it currently is so high and predict those factors will diminish or predict future events will causally explain the lowering, but mainly, this is just what happens.\u201dThe strongest arguments that they may be wrong, by contrast, focus on details of why China (as well as India, which they also analyze) has the potential to keep growing rapidly for many years to come.I asked Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs strategist who coined the term \u201cBRIC\u201d for the large emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, to critique the Pritchett-Summers paper.\u201cIn the case of China and India, the core driver of why a more positive path is likely to continue is the simple process of urbanization,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill wrote in an email. \u201cIf and when each get close to 70 percent urbanized, I\u2019d have more sympathy with their findings, but this is a long way off.\u201d (Just more than half of Chinese and a third of Indians live in cities. When people move from rural areas to cities, their economic output tends to rise sharply).In other words, a China bull can look at the details of the country\u2019s situation \u2014 the great potential of its people to keep increasing their productivity, a political system that has proved resilient through the challenges of the last few decades \u2014 and see plenty of reasons for optimism. The reversion-to-the-mean view says simply, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will go wrong, but history suggests that something will.\u201dIf the pessimistic view is right, there are enormous implications for the global economy\u2019s future. If China\u2019s per capita G.D.P. kept growing from now until 2033 at the same rate as it has in recent decades, the country\u2019s annual economic output would rise by $51.1 trillion over current levels in present-day dollars. By contrast, if growth reverts to the mean, the size of the Chinese economy will have increased only $11.2 trillion by 2033, or a difference of about $40 trillion. To put that in context, the current gross domestic product of the United States is about $17 trillion.For decades, economists have been building models to try to understand the mysteries of what drives growth. Is economic destiny shaped by culture? By government institutions? By patterns of industrialization?But those debates have been inconclusive. Consider some of the economic success stories of the last generation \u2014 China, India, Mexico, Poland, South Korea and Turkey, to name a few. All have different cultures, government institutions and economic development strategies.Years of work on growth theory suggest that there is no secret recipe for a developing nation to achieve prosperity. As it turns out, a simplistic reversion-to-the-mean approach explains economic growth about as well as some more complex approaches to predicting which countries\u2019 economies are poised to boom or shrink.This work also offers a reminder: If you just extrapolate from the recent past to predict the economic future, you are likely to be wrong. Analysts predicted that the Soviet economy would soon surpass the American economy in the 1960s, that Japan\u2019s would do the same in the 1980s and that the United States had achieved a new era of perpetual speedy growth in the late 1990s. None of these have come to pass.In other words, when it comes to predicting nations\u2019 fates over the long haul, we know a lot less than we like to admit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Guy Making Your Sandwich Has a Noncompete Clause", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsIf you are a chief executive of a large company, you very likely have a noncompete clause in your contract, preventing you from jumping ship to a competitor until some period has elapsed. Likewise if you are a top engineer or product designer, holding your company\u2019s most valuable intellectual property between your ears.And you also probably have a noncompete agreement if you assemble sandwiches at Jimmy John\u2019s sub sandwich chain for a living.Indeed, while HuffPo has no evidence that Jimmy John\u2019s, a 2,000-location sandwich chain, ever tried to enforce the agreement to prevent some $8-an-hour sandwich maker or delivery driver from taking a job at the Blimpie down the road, there are other cases where low-paid or entry-level workers have had an employer try to restrict their employability elsewhere. The Times article tells of a camp counselor and a hair stylist who faced such restrictions.American businesses are paying out a historically low proportion of their income in the form of wages and salaries. But the Jimmy John\u2019s employment agreement is one small piece of evidence that workers, especially those without advanced skills, are also facing various practices and procedures that leave them worse off, even apart from what their official hourly pay might be. Collectively they tilt the playing field toward the owners of businesses and away from the workers who staff them.These stories all expose the subtle ways that employers extract more value from their entry-level workers, at the cost of their quality of life (or, in the case of the noncompete agreements, freedom to leave for a more lucrative offer).What\u2019s striking about some of these labor practices is the absence of reciprocity. When a top executive agrees to a noncompete clause in a contract, it is typically the product of a negotiation in which there is some symmetry: The executive isn\u2019t allowed to quit for a competitor, but he or she is guaranteed to be paid for the length of the contract even if fired.Jimmy John\u2019s appears to have demanded the same loyalty as the price of having a low-paid job hourly job making sandwiches, from which the worker could be fired at any time for any reason. Similarly, retailers demand that their workers adjust to schedules that are set by computers and can vary widely from week to week or involve sending people home if sales are slow, but have little patience for an employee who needs to leave early to pick up a sick child.There are three questions facing employers as they make a broad range of decisions about what kind of arrangement they will have with their workers, particularly in this era when fewer and fewer employees are represented by unions.First, what is legally acceptable? The courts are even now hearing litigation on some of these questionable employment practices.Second, what is economically acceptable? For the last six years, unemployment has been very high, meaning workers have had little leverage to demand higher pay and better conditions.Third, what is morally acceptable? In this depressed job market, employers can get away with some practices that are entirely legal but seem fundamentally unfair.Future conditions for hourly workers will depend on what happens on all three frontiers. The courts will have their say on a range of wage theft, independent contractor classifications, and other labor issues in the months ahead. The economic recovery has picked up, but it is not clear yet whether it has improved enough to alter the balance of power between employers and workers.And as for morality, well, that comes down to whether more employers decide that basic human decency requires viewing their workers not as interchangeable cogs to be paid as little as possible and worked to the bone but as valuable partners in building a company for the long term.A handful of large companies, including Costco, Whole Foods and the fast food chain In-N-Out Burger, have embraced that approach, paying above-market wages and offering benefits for even entry-level workers. A major question for the future of the economy \u2014 and working conditions for millions of Americans \u2014 is whether the rest of corporate America, encouraged along by legal decisions, public pressure and an improving economy, will start to follow suit.Advertisement"}

Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company. \u201cThe pace of the expansion has clearly increased.\u201dWhile the G.D.P. report is mostly a look to the past, markets were generally cheered by the latest economic news, which also included an upswing in consumer confidence and further evidence from weekly unemployment claims that the labor market is on the mend. Bond prices barely moved as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 0.6 percent to 1,994.65 and the Dow Jones industrial average increased more than 221 points to close at 17,195.42.The economy\u2019s performance during July, August and September followed the second quarter\u2019s 4.6 percent annualized growth rate. This sustained expansion was welcomed after a bitter winter that contributed to a 2.1 percent decrease for the first three months of the year.\u201cThis is a pretty solid set of numbers,\u201d said John Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial. \u201cWe\u2019re doing O.K. here.\u201dMany forecasters expect the economy to continue to advance at a roughly similar pace, which should help the unemployment rate to keep falling.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be hard to maintain a growth of 3 percent for the fourth quarter,\u201d Mr. Tannenbaum said.Any conclusions about the economy\u2019s path, of course, are preliminary. Government statisticians will revise Thursday\u2019s figure twice, first in November and then in December. Based on experience, the final measure of growth could end up changing as much as a percentage point in either direction, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.In the meantime, skeptics pointed to some troubling signs. Consumer spending, though up 1.8 percent, was weaker than some economists had hoped given the recent job growth. They had expected lower- and middle-income families to spend money they saved from falling gas prices and wealthier households to spread around their profits from the stock market.\u201cThe components may not be as strong as the headline number shows,\u201d said Krishna Memani, chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds. The housing sector registered only a 1.8 percent gain, down from an 8.8 percent increase last quarter. And military spending, which jumped a whopping 16 percent, is notoriously volatile.Still, for nearly two years, government austerity has been a drag on the economy, and the 10 percent growth in federal spending this quarter reversed that trend, at least for now.Doug Handler, chief United States economist at IHS, predicted real growth for all of 2014 to be only 2.2 percent \u2014 below the United States\u2019 long-term average growth rate of 3 percent.Lurking beneath all the statistics is the concern that the promising numbers are masking profound inequalities and stagnant incomes for most Americans, as Ms. Yellen indicated in her Boston speech.\u201cIt is no secret that the past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation\u2019s history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity.\u201dAnd a report from the Conference Board showed that the consumer confidence index reached a seven-year high in October. That positive outlook combined with continued low gas prices could help push up consumer spending during the holiday season.Steven Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research, saw encouraging signs that the economy was evolving toward more domestic production, even if next quarter\u2019s growth rate falls below 3 percent.Investment in equipment, although down from its 11.2 percent growth in the second quarter, still posted a 7.2 percent increase. And Mr. Blitz was pleased by the 7.8 percent jump in net exports and the 5.5 percent rise in nonresidential fixed investments.\u201cThat\u2019s a more realistic building block for the economy,\u201d he said, \u201cthan to have overleveraged consumers buying homes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Faces Three Critical Tests", "Date": "2014-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 Europe is at a make-or-break moment. Two very different events on Sunday, occurring at opposite ends of the region, will largely determine the entire Continent\u2019s direction for years ahead: the parliamentary elections in Ukraine, and the release of results of bank stress tests and an asset quality review conducted by the European Central Bank.Before explaining the significance of these two events, and their unexpected linkage, I need to mention a third announcement, due next Wednesday: the European Commission\u2019s verdict on the budget for 2015 submitted last week by the French government. Next week, the commission will have to come up with a Solomonic judgment that somehow reconciles the French government\u2019s determination to stimulate its economy by cutting taxes with the German-imposed \u201cfiscal compact\u201d that Nicolas Sarkozy as the president of France rashly accepted in a moment of desperation in the 2012 euro crisis. This agreement requires France to raise taxes or drastically cut spending to reduce its budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product. The fiscal compact rules, if applied literally, would make economic recovery in France a mathematical impossibility. Yet bending these rules will provoke a public backlash in Germany, and perhaps even a Constitutional Court challenge, which could even force Chancellor Angela Merkel to renege on her commitment to support the rest of the eurozone. Depending on how these three events turn out, Europe will either be on the road to a moderate economic recovery next year or it will be condemned to continuing stagnation, possibly leading to the breakup of the eurozone or even the European Union as a whole. Why are the stakes suddenly so high? With most of Europe sliding back into recession over the summer as a result of the war in Ukraine and the failure to implement the kind of monetary and fiscal stimulus that revived the United States, Japanese and British economies, Europe now has an obvious choice: stick to failed policies that are almost certain to perpetuate economic stagnation, or change course. When faced with this choice, the German guardians of the euro\u2019s monetary and fiscal rule book defend the status quo, no matter how dismal. Germany\u2019s central bank and constitutional court are steeped in a tradition in which rules must be obeyed at all costs and following the letter of the law is more important than observing its spirit or achieving a desired outcome. But this legalistic philosophy is now running run up against the even more inexorable laws of mathematics, democracy and geopolitics. What if it is mathematically impossible for the governments in France and Italy to abide by European Union budget rules, because raising taxes and cutting public spending would crush economic activity and thus widen budget deficits instead of reducing them? What if electorates refuse to accept a decade of austerity and stagnation simply for the sake of preserving the Union\u2019s monetary and fiscal rules? And what if Ukraine\u2019s absolute sovereignty and territorial integrity cannot be re-established without risking an all-out war with Russia, which Western democracies will not tolerate? While politicians prefer to dodge these predicaments, the fact is that Europe has now reached a point where some of its rules will have to be changed or reinterpreted and some of its principles compromised. The only real question is whether Europe arrives at the necessary compromises through conscious political decisions or waits for them to be imposed chaotically by economic and electoral upheavals.Which brings us back to the three big events next week, and some reasons for optimism. Starting with the Ukrainian elections, a victory for President Petro O. Poroshenko\u2019s moderate party should allow European Union leaders to begin a genuine peace process that recognizes the loss of Crimea as irreversible and acknowledges Russia\u2019s vital interests in maintaining the military neutrality of its immediate neighbors.Once these basic conditions are satisfied, a rapprochement with Russia should become possible, allowing sanctions to be gradually dismantled \u2014 or at least confirming that sanctions will expire by mid-2015, as currently legislated. Removing the threat of war or further sanctions in Eastern Europe will have a major beneficial effect on businesses in Germany and Italy, which been hurt much more by the confrontation with Russia than European leaders expected. The asset quality review has always looked like a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for a substantial improvement in monetary policy. This is because the E.C.B. wants to stimulate private borrowing, as Britain did with the sub-prime mortgage subsidies it announced in March 2013, rather than supporting public debt, as was done in the quantitative easing programs in the United States and Japan. For the E.C.B.\u2019s plan to work, European banks must be recapitalized and cleaned up, which the asset review is designed to achieve. If Sunday\u2019s results prove convincing (admittedly still a big \u201cif\u201d), the stage will be set for the E.C.B. to announce some serious monetary stimulus after its next meeting on Nov. 6. Finally, a U-turn on fiscal austerity is highly probable when the European Commission delivers its verdict on the French budget on Oct. 29 \u2014 or, failing that, in mid-November, after a symbolic \u201cre-negotiation\u201d of the budget leading to some cosmetic strengthening of French structural reforms. Putting these three events together, Europe has a decent chance of breaking out in the next few weeks from its vicious circle of policy failure and economic stagnation. Whether policy makers seize this chance is, of course, open to question, given Europe\u2019s long record of doing too little, too late. If Europe again disappoints expectations, the recession will deepen, with no serious hope of recovery next year. In that case, public opinion will veer onto a course of political nationalism and economic disintegration, not just in Greece and Italy but also in France and Germany. By next year, it may be too late to reverse this. That\u2019s what is meant by a make-or-break moment. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Study Finds Shifts in Charitable Giving After Recession", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBetween 2006 and 2012, the wealthiest Americans became less generous with charitable donations, as a share of their total income, while lower- and middle-income Americans reached farther into their pockets as they witnessed the need for charity in their communities, a study says. \u201cThe wealthiest aren\u2019t being persuaded to up their share of giving in the same kind of way the poor are,\u201d said Stacy Palmer, the editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy. She added, \u201cIt makes it clear that the competition for dollars is really intense.\u201d But the total amount donated by the wealthy grew by $4.6 billion, accounting for inflation, to $77.5 billion between 2006 and 2012, she said. \u201cIn some ways, because the ranks of the wealthy are growing, that means that more people are giving,\u201d Ms. Palmer said.That $77.5 billion was 2.8 percent of the income of Americans who made $200,000 or more that year. Americans who earned between $50,000 and $75,000 donated 3.5 percent of their income to charity.Rates of giving fell in many of the biggest cities, but there were some marked increases. In Las Vegas, the share of income donated grew by 14.9 percent, which the study\u2019s authors attributed in part to a rise in smaller donations from people concerned about the economic downturn there. Charity officials told the study\u2019s authors that giving rates among lower-income donors appeared to increase elsewhere for the same reason. \u201cThey really felt close to the kinds of problems charities were trying to deal with,\u201d Ms. Palmer said. \u201cThey were feeling like, \u2018That could be me.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn Jacksonville, Fla., the share of income donated to charity increased by 8.7 percent, amid a sustained effort to improve the area\u2019s public schools, which suggests that concentrated campaigns can increase charity even during times of economic hardship.\u201cPeople felt so strongly about the campaign for the schools that people gave as much as they could at different income levels,\u201d Ms. Palmer said.The share of income donated fell by more than 10 percent in Philadelphia and in Buffalo, but the drop did not necessarily spell disaster for all charities in those cities. Philabundance, a hunger relief organization in Philadelphia, said it had experienced an increase in giving in recent years. Lindsay Hughes, a public relations manager for the agency, said hunger had been a prominent topic in the news over the last few years because of such issues as a decline in government food assistance.Religion appeared to play a role in promoting higher giving rates. Residents of Utah, where the Mormon Church encourages members to give significantly to charity, gave the highest share of their income to charity, 6.6 percent. Nine of the 10 cities where the giving rate was highest are in the so-called Bible Belt. Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire had the lowest rates. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Air France and Taft-Hartley", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAIX-EN-PROVENCE, France \u2014 The Air France pilots\u2019 strike may be over, but France\u2019s labor strife is far from resolved. The government seemed helpless as the iconic French carrier bled away 20 million euros a day during the two-week walkout. Though President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is on record as favoring reform, what exactly could he and his ministers have done to avert the costly shutdown at a time when France is so desperately in need of economic revival?Unless the French-Dutch airline, now doomed to yet another year of unprofitability, radically overhauls its business model, its plans to make its Transavia subsidiary competitive with Ryanair, easyJet and other low-cost carriers will go nowhere. When management offered Transavia pilots a lower pay scale, Air France pilots rebelled. Prime Minister Manuel Valls ordered them back to work, but in reality his power was limited to what President Lyndon Johnson would have called \u201cjawboning.\u201d The story is hardly new, certainly not in France, which is among the most strike-prone countries in Europe. In 2008, France lost 1.4 million working days to strikes, compared with just over 131,000 lost in Germany, according to the International Labor Organization, citing its latest available figures. France has no formal legal mechanism for dealing with strikes, such as the National Labor Relations Board or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in the United States.French leaders might find it profitable to look at the American experience. In 1946 American coal and railroad workers called for national strikes. Those two industries were the most important in the nation. Energy in those days came from coal not oil, and people traveled not by air but by car and train. The strikes had a crippling effect on the economy. President Harry S. Truman finally got the situation under control, but what Clark Clifford, Truman\u2019s special counsel, and others referred to as the \u201clabor wars\u201d led to a new law.The following year Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which introduced major changes to the National Labor Relations Act adopted during the Great Depression. Of Taft-Hartley\u2019s many provisions, the innovation under Title II of the law could prove useful in reducing the number of work days lost in France.When the American president deems that a threatened strike will imperil the country\u2019s health or safety, he may appoint a commission to study the issues and report back to him. The government can then ask a federal court to issue an injunction prohibiting the strike for a period of 80 days. If the judge agrees that the good of the nation is imperiled, he issues the injunction. Both management and employees are then required to meet with a federal mediation service. As the 80-day period comes to a close, the employees must vote on management\u2019s most recent offer. If they accept the offer, there is no strike. If they reject it, the government must ask the court to remove the injunction, and the employees are then free to go on strike. The 80-day cooling down provision of the Taft-Hartley Act has been largely successful in avoiding strikes. France has no similar law. French leaders can \u201cjawbone\u201d recalcitrant parties, as Johnson did; they can mediate if all parties agree. But they cannot compel the parties to sit down together, nor can they postpone a threatened strike that endangers the economy. Although Truman vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act, his veto was overruled by Congress. Subsequently, Truman discovered it was a useful tool and invoked it on numerous occasions.The need in France for a Taft-Hartley type law is acute because in France everyone goes on strike \u2014 lawyers, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, teachers, employees in industry, government and transportation. Even judges go on strike, even though their job security is absolute. In such a strike-addicted country it is astonishing that there exists no formal legal mechanism to enable the government to structure the dispute in a way that is fair to all parties, that will minimize public disruption and danger to the economy and that still preserves the right to strike.A nation that cannot reform is condemned to immobility. That is the sad condition of France today. Many businesses are uncompetitive; growth in the economy is nonexistent. In the absence of reform, growth and job creation are not on the horizon. No wonder the young are fleeing to Britain, Canada, Australia, the United States, wherever they can go and find hope.Hope is the building block of a nation. It is not wealth that makes people happy but hope that they can make plans, that tomorrow\u2019s prospects will be better than today\u2019s. Where there is no hope, there is apathy and fear. Without the necessary legal mechanisms, French leaders could not effectively deal with the Air France crisis and the conflicting aspirations of the pilots and management.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Strong Jobs Report, Charted", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Labor MarketRemember a month ago, when a crummy August jobs report raised some questions about just how robust the labor market recovery truly was? Never mind.The September numbers are in, the last to be reported before midterm elections, and they show a job market that is recovering steadily but surely, with the unemployment rate falling below 6 percent for the first time since July 2008. And a solid 248,000 net new jobs were created.But what are the finer details of the report telling us about the state of the American labor market? While the overall thrust of the report is unquestionably positive, there are some signs of continued weakness buried in the Labor Department numbers that give some reason for pause.But first, the good news. The 248,000 gain in September payroll employment is part of a bigger trend over the last year, in which payroll gains have taken a decisive shift upward. You can see the shift in the chart of year-over-year job gains.Over the course of 2014, the trend has risen from around 2.1 million net new jobs a year to 2.6 million as of September, the strongest since April 2006. That may be the single most important number to know to understand what people are talking about when they discuss the acceleration of American job creation.So what about that unemployment rate? Crossing below the 6 percent threshold to 5.9 percent is surely a talking point we will hear from Democratic candidates in the remaining weeks of this election cycle, and there is no question it is good news.And many of the internal details that are part of that decline in the unemployment rate are good, too. In September, 232,000 more people reported being employed and 329,000 fewer people reported being unemployed.But here\u2019s the less rosy sign of the report. The improving job market does not seem to be pulling people who left the labor force over the last few years back into it. In fact the size of the labor force actually ticked down by 97,000 in September, which in and of itself is too small a number in too volatile a series to make much of, but is part of a longer trend of the size of the labor force holding steady rather than increasing.Here, for example, are the proportion of Americans who are in the labor force (that is, either have a job or want one) and the proportion of Americans who have a job. We want to see both numbers rising, particularly given the sharp contraction in the labor force during an earlier phase of the recovery. Instead, the trend is flat.Ironically, if that starts to change \u2014 if people do begin returning to the labor force in meaningful numbers, it would put upward pressure on the unemployment rate as it takes those people some time to find jobs. But it would signal increasing confidence and help restore some of America\u2019s economic potential.Another acid test of the job market is whether a rising number of jobs is leading to increased wages. Here too, the results in September were a bit disappointing.The average hourly pay for private sector workers was flat in September (technically, down a penny to $24.53 an hour). Indeed, worker pay has been remarkably consistent over the last five years of recovery, hovering near 2 percent annual hourly pay consistently.Those numbers aren\u2019t adjusted for inflation, though. Inflation has hovered between 1 percent and 2 percent for most of that time, meaning that workers have seen oh-so-slight real pay increases. September inflation data is not available yet, but over the 12 months ended in August, the consumer price index rose 1.7 percent, meaning that in real terms pay rose only 0.3 percent in that span.For some sense of why that may be the case, it\u2019s worth looking at the breakdown of what sectors are driving stronger job growth.The biggest gainer is professional and business services, which tends to be a high paying sector. (Although the category does include temporary employees, who are often lower paid, temps accounted for only about a quarter of all jobs added in professional and business services in September.)But the next two sectors that drove job creation strongly were retail and leisure and hospitality. These are sectors that emphasize hourly employees with low benefits. The fact that those are among the strongest drivers of job creation \u2014 a trend that has been underway for a couple of years now \u2014 helps explain the mystery of stagnant inflation-adjusted wages.Over all, the September jobs numbers are unquestionably positive. But the asterisks are important, and the economy won\u2019t be truly healthy until the labor force increases some and real wages start rising.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weighing the Responses to Ebola ", "Date": "2014-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:This Ebola epidemic is rooted in recent history that has left the region incapable of containing it: West African armed conflicts, the diamond trade, starved national health services and maldistribution of resources.Responses to the epidemic must be primarily regional and continental. They should be long term and address how public health emergencies are embedded in weak economies, uneven international development and insufficient empowerment of women and girls.While responding to the current crisis, the United States should commit to building a solid West African public health care network and preparing for future epidemics. The writers are members of the faculty of the Center for African Studies at Rutgers University. To the Editor:It is common knowledge that patients infected with the Ebola virus are more likely to survive if given medical care in the United States. Therefore the basic human survival instinct will drive travelers to do and say whatever they must to get into the United States. Even if threatened with prosecution for endangering their fellow citizens, the aphorism \u201cI\u2019d rather be tried by 12 than carried by six\u201d (referring to trial by jury or funeral with six pallbearers) applies.If the United States is to protect its citizens from travelers arriving with the virus, it will have to rely on measures beyond self-disclosure to achieve it.To the Editor:Not enough effort and will are being marshaled to contain Ebola in the affected West African countries. It takes many weeks or months for medical personnel to set up facilities and begin to be effective in treating the infected, many of whom will die anyway despite all efforts at caring for them. Ebola could easily outpace these efforts.Meanwhile, airlines continue to ferry exposed but still asymptomatic people from the affected countries to European airports, where they then catch connecting flights to destinations around the world. This is madness. Halting commercial flights into and out of the affected countries will save many lives. When medical help is sent in or out, it should be exclusively via chartered flights organized by major health organizations. The writer is a retired neurophysiologist.To the Editor:Responsible people are saying the most reliable way to check for Ebola is to measure temperature. But we know that body temperature is easily lowered with drugs such as Tylenol or some steroids. Thermometry\u2019s positive results are useful, but negative results can be fatally misleading. While testing the blood is a sure way, it is cumbersome to test everyone coming through an airport. The best solution would be to develop a reliable saliva-based test.And given that Liberian ports are very active, the possibility of spreading the virus through sea travel has to be seriously considered.

{"Headline": "The Great Wage Slowdown of the 21st Century", "Date": "2014-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and OutcomesAmerican workers have been receiving meager pay increases for so long now that it\u2019s reasonable to talk in sweeping terms about the trend. It is the great wage slowdown of the 21st century.Of course, there is a long history of pessimistic predictions about dark new economic eras, and those predictions are generally wrong. But things have been disappointing for long enough now that we should take the pessimistic case seriously. In some fundamental way, the economy seems broken.\u201cIf we take the necessary steps to build on the foundation,\u201d he said, after a litany of the good news, \u201cI promise you, over the next 10 years we\u2019ll build an economy where wage growth is stronger than it was in the past three decades.\u201dHe may or may not be right about that. But the speech laid out the issues in unusually clear terms. And by any definition, the great wage slowdown \u2013 or its end \u2013 is one of the most important subjects in the country today.You can think of Mr. Obama\u2019s argument as falling into two categories (even if he didn\u2019t say so): the reasons that overall economic growth may accelerate, and the reasons that middle- and low-income workers may benefit more from that growth than they have lately. Both factors have contributed to the wage slowdown. The size of the pie hasn\u2019t been growing very fast, and most of the increases have gone to a small share of already well-fed families.And the number of high-school and college graduates is rising. The financial crisis deserves some perverse credit, because it sent people fleeing back to school, much as the Great Depression did. But some of the efforts to improve school performance \u2013 by raising standards and accountability \u2013 are also playing a role.Mr. Obama didn\u2019t mention her in the speech, but another reason for optimism at the White House is Janet Yellen, who took over the Federal Reserve this year. Under Ben Bernanke, her predecessor, the Fed was heroically creative in fighting the financial crisis. After the crisis, though, Fed officials made the same mistake repeatedly: overestimating the health of the economy. Ms. Yellen has suggested that she\u2019s learned that lesson and will be even more aggressive about trying to lift growth with low interest rates.It\u2019s certainly possible that we\u2019re on the verge of a pay surge, much as we were in the mid-1990s, when the situation also seemed bleak. It\u2019s also possible that the forces behind the great wage slowdown \u2013 from globalization to our often-sclerotic government to (at least for many workers) technological change \u2013 are still more powerful than the positive forces. In that case, the wage slowdown won\u2019t end until the country makes much more progress in improving education, cutting medical waste and energy costs and creating a more responsive, nimble government.Either way, the great wage slowdown, or the end of it, will help set the tone for American life in the coming decade. It has already done so in the century\u2019s first 15 years, causing widespread unhappiness with the country\u2019s direction and leading voters to shift partisan directions multiple times. The political turmoil isn\u2019t likely to end until the economic reality changes.Advertisement"}

Taylor, an economist at the University of California, Davis. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been thinking about this for a short time.\u201dMortgage lenders dodged the proposed rule by joining homebuilders and advocates of low-income homeownership to convince hundreds of lawmakers that defining supersafe mortgages as those with significant down payments would curtail mortgage lending to the struggling middle class and poor.That argument, while only partly related to the notion of requiring lenders to have skin in the game, pretty much stopped a central tenet of financial reform.In 1928, mortgages accounted for 39 percent of American banks\u2019 lending to nonfinancial private companies. By 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis, the share was 68 percent.\u201cThe changing nature of financial intermediation has shifted the locus of crisis risk towards mortgage lending booms,\u201d the authors wrote. Financial reform that gives mortgages a pass is not going to cut it.Most Americans have an interest in being able to obtain a reasonably priced mortgage. But there is a fundamental tension between Wall Street\u2019s interests and those of the rest of us. Financial institutions will naturally prefer to take more risks. After all, for them risk-taking has historically carried a lot of upside and, with taxpayer funds as the ultimate backstop, only a limited downside. Ordinary people have a very different experience.Tightening mortgage rules would no doubt make it more difficult to buy and sell homes. It would lead to more renters and fewer homeowners.That might be worth it, though. Germany is doing fine with a homeownership rate of 45 percent, compared with about 65 percent in the United States, which is actually down from a peak of near 70 percent in 2004.Sheila C. Bair, who ran the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation throughout the buildup of the mortgage bubble and its implosion, argues that a policy of pushing mortgages for every American family is hardly ideal.\u201cThere is this religion about homeownership being the primary path to wealth accumulation \u2014 notwithstanding the bad experience we\u2019ve had with it,\u201d she said.Indeed, in an uncertain economy with so little job security, it makes less sense for policy to encourage workers to lock themselves into mortgages. Even when homeownership is the right call, \u201cI don\u2019t think low-income people should be in private-label subprime mortgages,\u201d she added. That is what the Federal Housing Administration is for.Yet this is a Rubicon that our elected officials are afraid to cross. \u201cOn the margin, regulation does increase the cost of credit in the good times,\u201d Ms. Bair said. \u201cRegulators are battling a political system that wants to let the good times roll.\u201dStill, many experts say Washington is at least moving in the right direction. \u201cRegulations are putting the system in much better shape than it was,\u201d said Douglas J. Elliott, a former banker at J. P. Morgan who is now at the Brookings Institution in Washington.This is not merely a self-serving, American view. Across the Atlantic, John Vickers, a professor at Oxford and the former head of Britain\u2019s Independent Commission on Banking, agrees. \u201cI wish there had been greater steps,\u201d he said. \u201cBut major steps have been made toward a less fragile system.\u201dIs this enough to close the gap between Wall Street\u2019s unbridled appetite for risk and the broader public interest?The problem is, as long as we can\u2019t precisely measure the cost of financial excess, we will be prone to believe that the financial industry is simply too fragile to be meddled with.And with growth disappointing in just about every developed country, many people may be willing, even eager, to roll the dice again.Despite all the new efforts at regulation, Ariell Reshef of the University of Virginia noted, \u201cthere\u2019s maybe a slowdown in the growth of finance, but not a reversal.\u201dProfessor Vickers cited another paradox. \u201cIronically, the macroeconomic damage done by the crisis shows how important a well-functioning banking sector is,\u201d he said.The question is whether our banking sector is well functioning.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberia\u2019s Ebola Crisis Puts President in Harsh Light", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONROVIA, Liberia \u2014 The president waited until her family members were seated around the dining table before announcing, with no fanfare, the latest defection from her cabinet.As the table erupted with questions, the president, having said all that she intended to, finished up her lunch of Libby\u2019s tinned corned beef and rice \u2014 the Liberian equivalent of ramen noodles \u2014 and rose.\u201cWe\u2019re late,\u201d she announced, not mentioning that everyone had been waiting for her for four hours. \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go.\u201dFor the last eight years, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, 76, has walked a precarious political tightrope. As Liberia\u2019s first elected leader after a devastating civil war, she has juggled enemies and allies while pushing this country on its first sustained course of economic growth in decades.Now, Ebola has brought many of those gains to a screeching halt. The foreign investors so lovingly wooed by Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, a former World Bank bureaucrat, have fled. Today, ordinary Liberians on the street fling around the obscure phrase \u201cforce majeure\u201d to describe why businesses have closed, employers have left and road construction has ended.Public schools, in a country where less than 50 percent of primary-school-age children were enrolled, have been shut for months. The World Bank warns that Ebola could slash Liberia\u2019s fragile economy by nearly 12 percent. All but two foreign airlines, which Ms. Johnson Sirleaf had proudly welcomed back to the country after two decades of isolation, stopped flying here.\u201cRight now, all the international attention is on Ebola,\u201d she said of critics, including at the United Nations, who say she has been more worried about the economy than a health catastrophe. \u201cIf we don\u2019t focus on our economy, we will not be able to sustain it when they are gone.\u201dBut Ebola is threatening to derail that legacy. The epidemic has exposed crippling weaknesses in the public health system, decrepit infrastructure that has still not been dealt with more than a decade after the war, and endemic corruption that, despite Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s protestations of \u201czero tolerance,\u201d continue to characterize the interactions between Liberians and their government.\u201cThe international community has arrived and is now seeing our backyard for the first time,\u201d said Francis Dunbar, a former deputy finance minister who now supports Benoni Urey, a Johnson Sirleaf rival who was once a close adviser of Charles Taylor, the former president convicted of crimes against humanity. \u201cThe front yard is clean but the backyard is dirty.\u201dKarin Landgren, the United Nations secretary general\u2019s special representative here, echoed a similar theme. \u201cEbola has shone a very harsh light on the many things that had not been done adequately. Very tangible things, like the health care system.\u201dWith the global spotlight on Liberia, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s many domestic critics have found an international audience. Last month, the asthmatic daughter of Representative Edward Forh, a legislator, died after nurses refused to admit her until Ebola tests were run. Distraught, Mr. Forh took to the airwaves to denounce Ms. Johnson Sirleaf\u2019s government, saying that the president was \u201csurrounded by two groups of people: one group completely ignorant and the other group completely deceitful.\u201dBut just last year, Mr. Forh\u2019s colleagues in the Liberian Legislature voted to arrest one of the president\u2019s allies for releasing a recording in which Mr. Forh suggested that public funds should be given to him in a kickback scheme.\u201cYou eat some, I eat some,\u201d Mr. Forh was recorded saying, meaning kickbacks and bribes.The epidemic has inflamed such longstanding fights. Ms. Johnson Sirleaf says the criticism does not take into account how hard Liberia\u2019s culture of corruption is to overcome, and how widespread the postwar problems she inherited were.When she took office in 2006, unemployment was so high no one bothered to calculate it. There was no running water and no electricity, as gunmen had bombed the country\u2019s hydro plant. Downtown Monrovia at night looked medieval: candles in shopfronts cast their dim glow on the ribbons of dirty water running down the gutters.Children routinely died of curable diseases like tuberculosis, malaria and measles. Even among the unafflicted, few went to schools, and those who did had no textbooks. Liberia was $4.7 billion in debt, no longer considered creditworthy.By just about every economic indicator, the country has come a long way since. Growth shot up to 8.9 percent in 2013, from 5.3 percent in 2006. Ms. Johnson Sirleaf prodded international lenders to forgive Liberia\u2019s debt. Monrovia now has electricity, although many cannot afford it, while running water has been making a slow return around the country.\u201cLook, I know that I\u2019m a soft target for criticism right now,\u201d the president said. Her S.U.V. hit a pothole so deep she had to reach out to grab the armrest. Ms. Johnson Sirleaf glanced out the window, at an enormous pile of trash in front of a long-shuttered paint factory. Muttering \u201ctrash like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d she instructed her security detail to call the property\u2019s owner to clean up.\u201cPeople have forgotten the environment in which we used to live, because things now have become so free,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat moves a lot of the perceptions out there is our free talk on the radio, and in the press.\u201dIn the past, critics of the government were often jailed or even executed. Ms. Johnson Sirleaf was jailed after calling members of the military government of President Samuel K. Doe \u201cidiots.\u201dToday, the radio in Liberia buzzes with critics denouncing Ms. Johnson Sirleaf for nepotism (she appointed her son to run the national oil company), corruption (she has dismissed a string of officials in her government for corruption but has not prosecuted them) and, most recently, for supposedly manufacturing the Ebola epidemic as a ruse to get foreign aid money.Many Liberians, including some critics of Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, say that Liberia has no political leader more capable of steering the country out of its latest crisis, especially given her international reputation. When she sat down on the night of Sept. 9 and wrote a letter to President Obama pleading for help, the response came days later and dwarfed anything that neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea have been able to muster: 4,000 American troops, to build 18 Ebola treatment units in Liberia.Now, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf is trying to leverage Ebola help for broader economic projects \u2014 like fixing the runway at the airport.\u201cThe support that\u2019s coming must not all go into Ebola,\u201d Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said.On a muddy highway, her motorcade came to a small market along the road, with women selling fruits and vegetables.\u201cAye, man, I need to buy those women them bananas,\u201d Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said. \u201cBuy those women\u2019s red potatoes and bananas. And some of those guavas them.\u201d The motorcade stopped, and from one of the cars, an aide jumped out with a wad of cash and cleaned out the market.The weeks since Ebola hit have been dotted by crisis after crisis, some big, many minuscule. Two days before, Justice Minister Christiana Tah had sat unspeaking at a meeting with international donors. Everyone argued around a massive table at the foreign ministry, with Ms. Johnson Sirleaf at the head, looking like a stern teacher trying to rein in a bunch of unruly children.Her health minister harrumphed about international \u201cfree agents\u201d doing as they pleased without so much as a by-your-leave from the Liberian government. The American ambassador shot back that there were plenty of mechanisms to keep aid groups in their proper place.And the minister of defense, Brownie Samukai, was heckled for 15 minutes by a Liberian women\u2019s empowerment leader to pass one of the platters of Spam and cheese offered as snacks. He ignored her, trying to pay attention to the meeting, but his heckler raised her voice louder.\u201cI say, Brownie, you will not pass people de food?\u201d the advocate demanded. \u201cThis how you treat women?\u201dFinally, an exasperated Ms. Johnson Sirleaf called a timeout. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cY\u2019all can take a break to have some chips.\u201dOn the drive to visit Ebola treatment units, she recalled that moment with a shake of her head.\u201cWe\u2019re accustomed to the president being at the pivot of everything, making every decision, because we\u2019ve been used to an imperial presidency,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd even if I\u2019m not so inclined, they almost make you make every decision.\u201dAnd now Mr. Forh was on the radio again, saying her government should take responsibility for his daughter\u2019s death.Her S.U.V. had driven only 44 miles from Monrovia, but the potholes and rain \u2014 the Chinese contractors hired to pave the road left in August along with others fleeing Ebola \u2014 meant the drive had taken an hour and a half. The trip would be an additional 143 miles, on an even worse road. But Ms. Johnson Sirleaf was determined to go and return by the next night \u2014 she had more Ebola-related meetings to manage.\u201cMy adrenaline flows better in a crisis,\u201d Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said as a line of buses \u2014 each stenciled with slogans like \u201cGod\u2019s Appointed Time\u201d and \u201cGod is in Control\u201d \u2014 pulled over to let her motorcade pass.She grinned. \u201cThis will end up as one of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve had in a life of many challenges,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd like all the other challenges, we will overcome this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ending \u2018Poorism\u2019 in Kenya", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 One of the thriving sectors of the tourism industry here is also one that no government would want to put on brochures inviting visitors to the country. For a small fee, companies operated by entrepreneurs like the young rapper Henry Ohanga (Octopizzo to his fans) offer guided walks through Kibera, a sprawling slum in the heart of the capital. Tourists get to see up close the mountains of garbage and dense rows of low-slung wattle-and-mud houses that have made that township one of the most notorious urban settlements on the continent.Mr. Ohanga is an investor in \u201cpoorism\u201d \u2014 the business of taking well-off tourists off the beaten track to see how the destitute of this world live. It is a market niche that has grown a great deal in the past 10 years, and not just in Africa. Visitors to Brazil can join guided walks through Rio\u2019s toughest favelas; tourists in India get to see how Delhi\u2019s street children spend their nights; and in Johannesburg, for a fee, a visitor can explore the inner reaches of Soweto, home to thousands of struggling mine workers and their families.Poorism\u2019s critics are many. Not least among them are the inhabitants of these hard-bitten urban enclaves. Lillian Wambua, who ekes out a living selling mandazi, a local doughnut-like delicacy, from a tiny shack in Kibera, detests having her young son photographed by tourists. But she says she dares not raise her voice because visitors are often accompanied by local toughs working as guards for the tour companies. \u201cI feel bad when people come from other countries to see how poor we are,\u201d she told the Daily Nation recently.But Mr. Ohanga, who himself rose from one of the city\u2019s toughest neighborhoods to become a popular rapper, offers a staunch defense of his tours: \u201cWe don\u2019t bring people to Kibera to show how poor the residents are,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe want them to see the other side of the slum. When they come they realize that locals are clean, hardworking, normal people who simply lack good job openings. As a result of these tours, many projects have been launched to improve their livelihoods.\u201d Both critics and defenders of poorism make fair arguments, but in many ways this debate is beside the point. Kenya isn\u2019t a poor country, it\u2019s the economic powerhouse of the Horn of Africa, with a gross domestic product of $55.2 billion in 2013, classified by the World Bank as a middle-income nation. But our national wealth is very poorly distributed and the political elites who determine national priorities have never made better housing standards a priority. Given that the urban poor, like most Kenyans, vote mainly along ethnic lines, there is hardly any political lobby to press the case for better housing.Still, the Kenyan government has taken modest steps to make its urban slums a bit less distressing. In mid-September, hundreds of young people from the National Youth Service \u2014 a government program that offers high school graduates vocational training \u2014 were dispatched to Kibera to unclog drains, build communal toilets and set up a waste-disposal system. Residents largely welcomed the initiative. \u201cYouths are kept busy,\u201d Sheikh Yusuf Abu Hamza, told journalists, speaking outside a Kibera mosque. \u201cWe have seen a reduction in criminal activities here because the engagement with the N.Y.S. has offered the youth a source of livelihood.\u201dLaudable though that may be, the effort only scratches the surface of the real problem \u2014 a yawning gap between rich and poor.The desolation in our slums is a graphic reminder that the boom that began in 2003 has not raised all boats. According to U.N.-Habitat, an arm of the United Nations that deals with housing, about 60 percent of Nairobi\u2019s inhabitants live in informal settlements that together occupy only 5 percent of the land area of the Kenyan capital. Though new towers dot the skyline and a record number of students are pursuing higher education, Kenya and its neighbors have not managed to follow the trajectory of the many Asian nations that have lifted millions of people out of poverty by attracting industries that spur job growth. The Kenyan economy remains reliant on sectors like real estate and financial services that do not generate high levels of employment. Even earnings from agriculture, a major economic motor here, are primarily derived from a few large, mechanized farms. The top 10 percent of the richest households in the country control 40 percent of the country\u2019s income. A 2008 study by Mwangi wa Githinji of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and Frank Holmquist of Hampshire College, found that while agricultural production grew at 6.9 percent in 2006, 25 percent of that growth was attributable to the flower sector, which is dominated by 10 farms, one of them producing over 50 percent of the output.To address such problems, East African countries with good political and trade ties, such as Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, should pool resources to invest in the sort of major infrastructure projects \u2014 port expansion, efficient transport links \u2014 that attracted investors to Asia. Some efforts have been made in this direction, but clearly not nearly enough.Many Kenyans in rural areas are subsistence farmers. Life on a hard-scrabble farm has little appeal for many young people. Every year, tens of thousands pour into the cities to find work. A visit to Kibera at dawn reveals throngs of workers traveling to low-paying jobs as laborers. Everywhere, there are signs of the bustling economic activity that prompted The Economist to declare that Kibera \u201cmay be the most entrepreneurial place on the planet,\u201d with peddlers selling everything from bananas to phone credit cards to water.This enterprising bent has inspired people like Mr. Ohanga, who says his business is helping others climb out of poverty. \u201cI try to impress upon visitors to start projects here and promote existing ones,\u201d he told me.It\u2019s a worthy enough effort, but it would not be necessary if the government promoted more policies designed to make \u201cpoorism\u201d a thing of the past, instead of a growing concern.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Minding the Transit Gap ", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThomas Prendergast, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, last week described his vast network of subways, buses and commuter trains as the \u201cengine\u201d for a regional economy that accounts for 11 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. Without the M.T.A., he wrote, \u201cNew York as we know it could not function.\u201dMr. Prendergast\u2019s assessment, was the prelude to a plea to city, state and federal officials for more money. The system, which serves 8.7 million customers a day, has many needs, from improved safety mechanisms on suburban trains to new subway cars, additional stations in the Bronx and an extension of the unfinished Second Avenue line north to Harlem. The whole system needs more funds for protection against the next Hurricane Sandy.All that comes with a $32 billion price tag over the next five years, about $15 billion more than the M.T.A. has on hand. Filling that gap will require new thinking about how to cut costs and raise revenues on top of the regularly scheduled fare increases of about 4 percent every two years. The M.T.A. has yet to offer proposals, but its board is expected to ask the city for more than its paltry $100 million annual subsidy. The state may have to increase revenues beyond the real estate and payroll taxes that are levied in the regions where the M.T.A. operates. There may be other useful strategies, like establishing public-private partnerships to help run stations and getting the city to revive a congestion pricing plan to charge for vehicles entering Manhattan during rush hours and diverting some of those revenues to mass transit. Charging on toll-free East River Bridges and using that money for mass transit is another good idea, long overdue but politically difficult. Gov. Andrew Cuomo rode the subway last week to demonstrate how safe it was in the wake of reports that Islamic State terrorists had targeted subway systems here and in Europe. A better measure of his support would be an infusion of state money to keep the M.T.A. running smoothly. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BASF, an Industrial Pillar in Germany, Leans Abroad", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany \u2014 In the 1860s an entrepreneur named Friedrich Engelhorn started a firm here to produce dyes for Europe\u2019s booming textile industry. Almost 150 years later, that company, Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik \u2014 or BASF \u2014 is the world\u2019s largest maker of chemicals.Despite its growth into a global company, BASF has remained an integral part of the industrial base that has helped Germany grow into Europe\u2019s largest economy. And Ludwigshafen remains the company\u2019s hometown. The BASF site, spread over four square miles along the Rhine River, resembles a small city, with 33,000 employees working in 2,000 buildings, crisscrossed by roads and railways.Lately, though, BASF has been investing more of its money and management energy outside Germany, especially in the United States. And the company\u2019s reasons for doing that help illustrate why the German industrial economy has been losing momentum \u2014 and why Germany risks tipping back into recession.BASF executives say that German and European Union policies toward industry, particularly when it comes to energy, are forcing big companies to look elsewhere as they seek to expand.Energy is perhaps BASF\u2019s biggest cost. Tremendous amounts of electricity are required to produce chemical raw materials like ethylene, propylene and butadiene for a range of products like plastics, pharmaceuticals and rubber. And oil or natural gas are the basic feedstocks from which these chemicals are produced.Especially in Germany, energy prices have jumped as a result of the government\u2019s big push for renewable energy sources \u2014 a policy that the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has labeled the Energiewende, or energy transition.At the same time, surging production of natural gas from shale rock in the United States is creating cheap and ever more abundant energy, giving American chemical plants and manufacturing sites a new competitive edge over facilities in Europe.That is a big reason BASF is expanding some of its plants in the United States and looking to build others.Already, BASF has doubled its annual investment in the United States to about $1 billion a year. With its French partner Total, it recently completed an estimated $400 million expansion and upgrade of their petrochemical plant in Port Arthur, Tex., which employs about 250 people.As a result of the modifications, the plant\u2019s main production engine, an installation known as a steam cracker \u2014 which was first fired up in 2001 and previously used feedstock derived from oil \u2014 can now make its chemicals from shale gases, allowing for potentially huge savings.\u201cWe shift investment money from Europe into the U.S. as a consequence of the less competitive environment in Europe,\u201d Harald Schwager, a senior member of BASF\u2019s executive board, said in an interview here.It is a major strategic shift for the company, which had 74 billion euros, or about $94 billion, in revenue last year.Over the next five years, BASF plans to pump a quarter of its planned \u20ac20 billion in investments into North America. For the first time, the company plans to trim its spending in Germany from its traditional level of at least a third of investment to only a quarter.And slightly fewer than half of the company\u2019s approximately 113,000 employees are now in Germany. These days, about 17,000 of them are in North America and about the same number work in Asia.On Friday, the company reported a nearly 5 percent decline in profits for the third quarter, compared with a year earlier, and reduced its earnings forecast for 2015. The company cited the weak European economy as well as slower growth in emerging markets.But while BASF said sales in its core chemicals business had declined by 4 percent in Europe, it added that its North American chemicals business had seen strong growth, as a result of demand for products from the Port Arthur plant. It did not provide a specific number for the North American results.BASF\u2019s overseas expansion comes even as Ms. Merkel\u2019s government pushes corporate Germany to invest more within the country to help revive the flagging economy \u2014 even though her administration so far is declining to commit to any government stimulus investments.BASF is not alone in looking beyond the country\u2019s borders. Since 2011, the chemical industry over all \u2014 Germany\u2019s third-largest industrial sector after automobiles and machinery \u2014 has not increased production or investment in the country, according to VCI, an industry association.And nearly a quarter of all companies in heavy industry are considering reducing production in Germany, according to a survey by the German Chambers of Commerce.The falloff in German investment in industrial sectors, also including aluminum and glass production, is not the only reason for the worrying slowdown in Europe\u2019s biggest economy. But it is certainly a factor.The government recently trimmed its economic growth forecast for 2014 to 1.2 percent, compared with 1.8 percent in April. Berlin also slashed its projection for 2015 to 1.3 percent, down from the previous 2 percent, blaming crises abroad and a downturn in global growth.It could just as well have cited energy costs.\u201cIn a highly competitive world, German industry is at an increasing disadvantage owing to the growing energy price disadvantage that it faces,\u201d the market research firm IHS wrote in a study published this year.Paul Hodges, chairman of International eChem, an industry adviser, estimates that costs for petrochemical companies are now 20 percent to 25 percent lower in the United States than in Europe.Electricity in Germany already costs about 1.2 euro cents more than the average price across the European Union. Although industries deemed energy-intensive are exempt from many of the surcharges that go toward financing the planned transformation of Germany\u2019s energy sector into one largely dependent on renewable resources by 2050, that exemption is not secure.The European Union threatened to overturn the exemption this year on grounds of unfair competition, but decided instead to allow it to continue until 2017. That extension, though, added to the uncertainty for big German industrial companies trying to plan for the longer term.\u201cWe are seeing a shift in investment,\u201d said Hubertus Bardt, head of energy at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research. \u201cWhen we ask big companies what they are doing, about a third say they are holding back on making long-term decisions. They only have security for the next three years.\u201dIndustry leaders criticize Berlin for not adopting policies that might bring down fuel costs, including allowing exploration for shale gas. A big impediment to encouraging shale development is that extracting the gas often involves hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which environmentalists oppose.BASF has a unit, Wintershall, that is the largest oil and gas producer in Germany. The company has large exploration tracts for shale gas in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Mr. Schwager, the BASF executive, estimates that fracking could produce enough shale gas to either satisfy Germany\u2019s own needs for 10 years or maintain current gas production levels for a couple of centuries.But the company has been prevented from drilling for the fuel because of concerns about water pollution and other hazards.Even its conventional gas operations, Germany\u2019s largest, have been hobbled by a moratorium on fracking, Mr. Schwager says.Pending legislation would set the bar for environmental standards so high that it would essentially rule out widespread exploration for shale gas. It would, however, allow the resumption of fracking for the extraction of more conventional gas reserves, after a two-year moratorium.The potential erosion of mainstay industries dismays executives like Mr. Schwager.Mr. Schwager, 54, who has been at BASF for more than a quarter-century, formerly ran all of the company\u2019s European manufacturing sites, including Ludwigshafen. He is now the top executive for Europe, as well as chief of the company\u2019s sizable oil and gas operations.Executives of Mr. Schwager\u2019s pedigree and experience have been integral to the German socioeconomic system for decades, working with government and labor to develop the country\u2019s export machine into the global leader, at least by one key measure: Germany\u2019s exports as a share of gross domestic product, at about 40 percent, are by far highest among the world\u2019s 10 biggest economies, according to IHS.But now, rather than export their products from home, German companies increasingly prefer to make them elsewhere.Mr. Schwager outlined other big investment plans for the Gulf Coast of the United States, including a plant that will make propylene, which is used in a wide range of products including paints, carpets and diapers, from natural gas. The company is still scouting for a site for the plant, which would be its largest investment in the region, costing more than \u20ac1 billion.\u201cThe whole shale gas revolution really has created a renaissance in the petrochemical industry,\u201d said Heidi Alderman, BASF\u2019s senior vice president for North America, who is based in Houston. \u201cInvestments that previously might not be considered in North America are now coming to North America.\u201dOther European companies are also being drawn to the United States.Wacker Chemie, based in Munich, is building a $2 billion plant in Tennessee to make polysilicon, a material that is used to make solar panels. Wacker\u2019s manufacturing process will rely heavily on chlorine, a chemical whose manufacture requires huge amounts of energy.In September, the German industrial giant Siemens agreed to buy Dresser-Rand, a Houston-based maker of equipment for the energy industry, for $7.6 billion. Two Austrian steel makers, Voestalpine and Benteler, are building mills on the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana.\u201cThe bad thing from a European perspective, not from a company perspective but for the region Europe, is it\u2019s not only BASF,\u201d Mr. Schwager said. \u201cIt is many European companies which are energy-intensive. They are finding out that the benefits of shifting investment from Europe to the U.S. are significant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Change Concerns Push Chile to Forefront of Carbon Tax Movement", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreen ColumnAnd yet, for environmentalists, a sliver of hope exists in the shape of Chile, one of Latin America\u2019s fastest-growing economies, which last month approved the first carbon tax in South America. The measure, due to take effect in 2018, was part of a broad overhaul of the tax system.\u201cChile is one of the countries that is getting much more serious about climate change, and developing something that\u2019s much more robust in terms of policies,\u201d said Miguel Pinedo-Vasquez, a forest ecologist at Columbia University.Chile\u2019s tax, which targets large factories and the electricity sector, will cover about 55 percent of the nation\u2019s carbon emissions, according to Juan-Pablo Montero, a professor of economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, who informally advised the government in favor of the tax. At $5 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted, Chile\u2019s tax is lower than the $8-per-metric-ton carbon price in the European Union\u2019s carbon-trading system, which has often been criticized as too lax. But it is higher than a carbon tax introduced in Mexico in January.\u201cWe all understand we need to go way beyond the $5 mark\u201d in order to really reduce carbon emissions, Dr. Montero said. However, he added, \u201cI think this still allows you to start building the institutions that you need in the future, when you start moving forward toward more ambitious goals.\u201dChile\u2019s carbon tax was prompted by concerns about climate change, which is already expanding the nation\u2019s deserts, according to Jorge Valverde Carbonell, an under secretary adviser in the Chilean Ministry of Finance. Asked if the tax could eventually be increased, Mr. Valverdesaid it was possible. However, he added that Chile\u2019s contribution to the world\u2019s greenhouse gas problem is small, and that countries that produce more emissions should take the lead.Some warn that the tax will hurt Chile\u2019s economy, including the energy-intensive mining sector, because electricity prices are already high and because few other nations are taxing carbon emissions. The tax \u201cdefinitely reduces the competitiveness of our industry,\u201d said Luis Felipe Arze, a partner at Carey & Allende, a Santiago-based law firm, who represents a spectrum of energy-related clients.With desert landscapes and winds generated by the Pacific Ocean and the towering Andes Mountains, \u201cthere is no restriction of availability of solar and wind in Chile,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Pica T\u00e9llez, a professor in the department of industrial engineering at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile who supports the tax. However, as renewable energy projects get built, the availability of transmission lines to move power will become an issue, he said.\u201cChile has always been a forward-leaning country on environmental policy,\u201d said Gordon McCord, an assistant professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at the University of California, San Diego. Nations like Chile and Peru, parts of which depend heavily on snowmelt from the high mountains for drinking water and irrigation, are being forced to face the effects of climate change, he said. In recent years, drought has cut into Chile\u2019s hydroelectric production.Chile\u2019s approval of a carbon tax owes much to its positioning inside a broader tax package, experts said. At the same time that it passed the carbon tax, the Chilean government raised corporate taxes substantially, in a bid to increase revenues for education and other projects. As a result, the carbon tax raised less debate within Chile than it might have otherwise, though electricity companies have objected.Power plants of at least 50 megawatts (roughly one-tenth of the size of a typical coal plant) must pay the tax, which will not affect the transportation sector.Mr. Valverde, of the Ministry of Finance, said that the long-term effect on Chileans\u2019 electric bills would be tiny, and that electric companies would absorb the tax in the short term.Once the carbon tax is in place, Chile could eventually connect with other international carbon-pricing systems, Dr. Montero said. Because Chile\u2019s economy is oriented toward exports, he added, the nation will be in a good position if carbon becomes a factor in worldwide trade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Estonians Embrace Life in a Digital World", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTALLINN, Estonia \u2014 The centuries-old city center here looks quaintly antique, with well-worn cobbled streets lined by medieval buildings at nearly every turn.But the people have fully embraced the digital world, enthusiastically adopting public and private online services \u2014 offering a snapshot of a society that lives first and foremost online.Estonians, using a national identity card embedded with a microchip, gain access to some 4,000 services, including banking, business registration and even fishing licenses. They review medical records and order prescriptions on smartphones. Almost everyone files taxes on the web within minutes, and about a third of voters now cast their ballots online.While Europe and the United States debate the role of technology in people\u2019s daily lives, Estonia has welcomed it as a fact of life, largely shooing away concerns about data privacy that have become hot-button issues elsewhere. In the last 23 years, Estonia, a Baltic country, has transformed from being a member of the Soviet bloc to one of the most connected countries, using technology built primarily within its borders.The rest of the world \u2014 particularly Europe \u2014 has taken notice. The country\u2019s former prime minister, Andrus Ansip, has been tapped to become the new European Commission vice president in charge of Europe\u2019s digital future. If he is confirmed for the job by Europe\u2019s lawmakers, he will face pressure to improve online privacy and give people greater control over their information, which stands somewhat at odds with Estonia\u2019s approach to digital services.During a three-hour nomination hearing in Brussels on Monday, Mr. Ansip trumpeted his support for Europe\u2019s privacy agenda.\u201cWe have to protect everyone\u2019s privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cTrust is a basic principle. If people can\u2019t trust e-services, they will never use them.\u201dBut he also pushed the upside of going digital. \u201cI know from personal experience that paperless government can work,\u201d he said.With a population of 1.3 million, about the same as in Dallas, Estonia faces fewer challenges than bigger countries like Britain and the United States when introducing online services. And while it remains uncertain whether other countries can follow Estonia\u2019s path, it is clear Estonia has little desire to turn back.\u201cDigital services have changed our lives,\u201d said Taavi Roivas, who recently succeeded Mr. Ansip as prime minister. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to communicate with the state, and there\u2019s a lot less bureaucracy.\u201dThe transformation has been made on a small budget. The country spends about 50 million euros, or $63 million, a year on information technology, far from the $700 million spent on HealthCare.gov, the online health insurance marketplace in the United States. Most of the money goes to local companies, some of which began in local research centers started in the Soviet era.In large part, Estonia\u2019s decision to go digital also has been driven by one basic fact: It had no other choice.When the Iron Curtain fell, Estonia had few financial resources and a small population to jump-start its economy. Local policy makers also soon realized that they could not offer Western-style services without using new technology, including the Internet, that could keep government costs at a bare minimum. \u201cLuckily, Estonia was never a rich country,\u201d said Priit Alamae, chief executive of Nortal, a local company that built much of the technology powering Estonia\u2019s digital services. \u201cWe\u2019re like a working-class child and had to earn everything on merit.\u201dWhile Estonia\u2019s online services have expanded rapidly, the system still relies on two staples.All Estonians are issued an identity card at 15, which includes a microchip that holds personal information and allows access to government and commercial services. To keep records safe, each card uses a personal identification number that must be correctly entered before using the digital offerings. The numbers are much harder to compromise than signatures and other forms of online security, analysts say.Estonia also relies on a government-run technology infrastructure, called X-Road, that links public and private databases into the country\u2019s digital services. All personal information is kept on separate servers and behind distinct security walls of government agencies, but the system allows the state and businesses like banks to share data when individuals give consent.Estonia\u2019s willingness to use digital products sets it apart from France and Germany, where people have objected to keeping data online. Estonians have embraced the concept. The country\u2019s systems have recorded few serious security breaches that could test people\u2019s faith. And many residents say the online services are more secure and more convenient than traditional methods of dealing with the government.Now, about 98 percent of people file their income taxes online through an automated system that takes roughly five minutes to complete, said Marek Helm, who leads Estonia\u2019s tax and customs authority. That has increased overall tax compliance, cut his agency\u2019s staff in half, to 1,500 employees, and allowed the government to issue tax refunds within a week.The transition to a digital life has come with a few hiccups.Estonia\u2019s online medical portal routinely crashed after digital prescriptions were introduced in 2010 because retirees \u2014 the main users of regular prescriptions \u2014 kept signing into the system to renew their medication on the day they all received monthly social security payments. And some local politicians have voiced concerns that the introduction of Internet voting in 2005 has led to suspicions of election fraud.But Estonians largely view the country\u2019s digital services as the standard way of interacting with the government and local companies \u2014 a far cry from the rest of Europe. Citizens are more concerned about frequent government requests for online information than they are about privacy, said Siim Sikkut, a technology adviser to the Estonian government. To prevent people from being bombarded for information, Estonia passed a law that required the authorities to ask only once for specific data, like someone\u2019s date of birth. That means local agencies and companies are legally obliged to share basic information when requested, to make it easier for people to use online services.\u201cIf we had a centralized system, it would be a privacy concern,\u201d said Taavi Kotka, Estonia\u2019s chief information officer, during a recent walk through the picturesque center of Tallinn. \u201cBut nobody has the whole picture. Everything is separate, but connected.\u201dThe country now wants to take its digital services global by signing up people living outside Europe for so-called \u201ce-residency\u201d that would give people anywhere in the world access to Estonia\u2019s public and private online services.The upside, Estonians say, is convenience.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing things the old-fashioned way,\u201d said Priit Heinla, 27, a project manager for an energy company who regularly signs documents with digital signatures on computers or mobile devices.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sign a mountain of paperwork,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one signature and you\u2019re done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Budget Clearance for France and Italy Comes With an Asterisk", "Date": "2014-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 A day after giving France and Italy a provisional pass on their budget plans for next year, a top European Union official warned on Wednesday that those countries could still face disciplinary action for violating the bloc\u2019s fiscal rules if the revised budgets did not pass muster.\u201cI want to underline that this does not mean that all draft budgetary plans will necessarily be found to be in full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact,\u201d Mr. Katainen said, referring to the European Union\u2019s budget rule book. \u201cWe are not prejudging the outcome,\u201d he said.Mr. Katainen has been walking a tightrope in recent weeks. Cracking down too heavily on France and Italy could have forced more belt-tightening at a time of rising concern about the inability of the European economy to resume growth. Rejecting the budgets outright could have prompted battles with Paris and Rome that Brussels might not have been able to win.But Mr. Katainen was also under pressure to ensure that governments abide by the European Union\u2019s fiscal rules \u2014 routinely flouted over the last decade by large member states, including Germany, which has preached budget discipline to other countries in the eurozone. A failure to police those rules risks making international investors more jittery about Europe\u2019s ability to stave off another sovereign debt crisis.In recent weeks, Germany had indicated that it still expected France and other eurozone countries to do their best to meet the European Union\u2019s deficit targets, even though the German economy has stalled (the weakness of its European Union neighbors is a reason German exports have been falling).The German Finance Ministry declined to comment on Wednesday on the latest turn in the Brussels budget negotiations. \u201cWe have always said this is a matter for the commission,\u201d Nadine Kalwey, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said. She was referring to the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.Once the commission has examined and delivered judgment, she noted, the budgets would go to the Eurogroup, which is made up of finance ministers from countries in the eurozone. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to wait for.\u201dThe European Commission had to decide by Wednesday if it would request that countries found to be widely out of step with the rules redraft their budgets. But promises by France and Italy to make serious budget-cutting efforts defused the standoff.The European rules call for a nominal deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product. As part of that effort, countries are also required to reduce their structural deficits \u2014 the difference between revenue and spending when the effects of the economic cycle are stripped out \u2014 by an amount tailored to each country\u2019s nominal deficit and national debt.France\u2019s revision represents \u201ca significant improvement,\u201d Mr. Katainen said on Wednesday. But he added that the commission needed more time to analyze the numbers and make a final judgment, he said.Mr. Katainen also warned that countries like France that are already under formal scrutiny \u2014 a process known in Brussels jargon as an excessive deficit procedure \u2014 needed to be sure to make corrections. \u201cAt the end of this path is the possibility of fines,\u201d he said.In the case of Italy, Mr. Katainen said that the government had \u201cengaged constructively\u201d with the commission on its budget submission. But he also said that further assessment was necessary and that Italy needed to make good on its promises of overhauls. \u201cGood plans, which would change Italy\u2019s growth \u2014 potentially substantially \u2014 should be adopted by both houses of Parliament and implemented,\u201d he said.The next hurdle for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy is avoiding the watch list of the excessive deficit procedure, which would bring much closer monitoring of his country\u2019s finances. It could also lead to fines if the country was to fail to show it was making enough of an effort to control its debt.Responsibility for future decisions on France and Italy will be shared between Valdis Dombrovskis, a former prime minister of Latvia who will take a senior role overseeing the euro; and Pierre Moscovici, a former French finance minister, who will succeed Mr. Katainen on economic and monetary affairs.Mr. Katainen will stay at the commission, but in a senior role overseeing jobs, growth and competitiveness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Ad in Connecticut Election Puts Focus on Guns", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Mr. Malloy, a Democrat, is not the only candidate shouldering the ambitions of well-heeled national political leaders, and profiting from their largess.His Republican challenger, Thomas C. Foley, a former ambassador to Ireland and private equity investor, has benefited from millions of dollars in outside contributions from the Republican Governors Association. The group\u2019s chairman, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, has seized on an opportunity to show his clout by trying to help Mr. Foley swing a traditionally Democratic state in New England.The infusion of outside money \u2014 and the barrage of negative advertisements it is paying for \u2014 underscores the national implications of the tight race, one that has drawn a parade of party leaders whose charisma often eclipses that of the two candidates.Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s money, part of a broader effort to aid candidates with bipartisan credentials who have made curbing gun violence a priority, is financing an ad supporting a strict gun control bill that Mr. Malloy signed in 2013 with Republican support. The money is coming from Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s Independence USA PAC, which plans to spend about $25 million backing moderate candidates of both parties before the midterm elections.The spending could play a pivotal role in a state that is still dealing with the lingering shock from the 2012 shooting at the elementary school in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 first graders and six school staff members were killed. It is Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s biggest expenditure on any single commercial this fall, said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, though he has spent more overall on the Michigan governor\u2019s race.The gun control law signed by Mr. Malloy required background checks and banned many models of assault-style weapons and large ammunition magazines. Mr. Foley has said he would sign a repeal of that bill, and used his debate appearances to criticize Mr. Malloy for not instead focusing on broader access to mental health treatment.Citing a drop in Connecticut\u2019s homicide rate, the ad, which began running on Friday in the expensive New York City market, says that Mr. Foley is \u201cmaking us less safe.\u201dMr. Wolfson said Mr. Malloy won Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s support by including Republicans in his push for gun safety and by advancing educational reform measures that emphasized teacher accountability.But it was Mr. Foley\u2019s opposition to gun control measures, Mr. Wolfson said, that \u201csurprised\u201d Mr. Bloomberg and sealed his financial involvement in the close race. Referring to Mr. Foley\u2019s support from gun rights advocacy groups like the National Rifle Association, Mr. Wolfson added, \u201cThe N.R.A. is a huge liability for him.\u201dSpeaking about the two candidates, he continued, \u201cThe difference is so clear and so stark that we wanted to get involved.\u201dIn an interview this week, Mr. Foley dismissed the notion that campaign ads on liberal priorities like the minimum wage or gun control would sway voters concerned about the economy.\u201cI don\u2019t think someone coming in and talking about guns is going to change many votes,\u201d he said.But like the governor, who on Friday also released a television ad heralding the support of former President Bill Clinton, Mr. Foley has seen his national profile lifted by the presence of magnetic party leaders. The Republican Governors Association, the largest single contributor to Grow Connecticut, a super PAC that supports Mr. Foley, reported $574,500 in spending this week, pushing its total contributions to $4.8 million.For Mr. Christie, who has made multiple visits to Connecticut to support Mr. Foley and who is expected to make more before the election, a Foley victory could attest to Mr. Christie\u2019s ability to attract moderate voters as he considers a presidential run in 2016.Mr. Malloy, who has feuded publicly with Mr. Christie since early in his term, is unbowed. A super PAC largely financed by the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association, Connecticut Forward, has collected more than $5 million to support Mr. Malloy\u2019s candidacy. He has also benefited from millions of dollars from national labor unions that have returned to the governor\u2019s side after a bruising fight before his first budget, which exacted $1.6 billion in concessions from public sector unions.The concessions, which focused on health insurance and pension contributions, were \u201cfrustrating,\u201d said Lori Pelletier, executive secretary-treasurer of the Connecticut A.F.L.-C.I.O. But the governor has regained the unions\u2019 trust by supporting collective-bargaining rights and trying to expand job opportunities in manufacturing. Of the unions\u2019 relationship with Mr. Malloy, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s like building a stone wall one rock at a time.\u201dThat rapprochement, Mr. Malloy said this week, has vindicated a conciliatory approach to governing that he has long said would prove more effective than his New Jersey counterpart\u2019s more blustery style.Comparing himself to Mr. Christie, he said, \u201cI took a much tougher road when it came to dealing with Connecticut\u2019s problems. I think it was the right thing to do, but it may not be the politically right thing to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Volt is assembled at G.M.\u2019s last assembly plant in Detroit, Hamtramck.Ms. Barra added that G.M. would invest an additional $300 million in Michigan to support its vehicle electrification projects.\u201cWe must provide the breakthrough technology the customers want,\u201d she said.Volt sales have dropped 13 percent in the United States in the first nine months of this year, lagging G.M.\u2019s overall 4 percent sales improvement. By contrast, sales of the all-electric Nissan Leaf have soared 35 percent.G.M. did not provide details on fuel-economy and other improvements planned for the Volt, which has struggled to find buyers partly because cheap gasoline has made conventional cars more attractive to consumers.The current version of the Volt gets between 35 and 40 miles of pure-electric driving range on a single battery charge. When its gas engine provides the power, it has an estimated fuel economy of 35 miles per gallon in city driving.The Volt news is the latest effort by G.M. to draw attention to its products, and away from the safety crisis it has faced this year.Since acknowledging this year that it had failed to fix defective cars for more than a decade, G.M. has issued recalls covering about 30 million vehicles.But Ms. Barra said the frequency of recalls had dropped, mostly because G.M. had reorganized its engineering operations, added more investigators and encouraged workers to report safety problems to top management. \u201cWe have very good sensing mechanisms in place,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve seen a change already.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Debt Collector\u2019s Day", "Date": "2014-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionNOBODY likes debt collectors. But a great many of us have to deal with them. A recent study by the Urban Institute found that roughly one-third of all Americans have a debt in collections reported on their credit file. For many debtors, that means being called, hounded and even threatened on a regular basis. But what\u2019s it like to be the collector? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are roughly 369,000 bill and account collectors in America, and that number is projected to grow. There is a perverse logic at play here. In a stagnant economy, we can barely pay our debts, but we can still pay people to collect on them. For the past two years, I have been working on a book on the debt collection industry and, as part of my research, I spent time at a small agency in Bangor, Me., owned by Brandon Wilson. His collectors tend to be young men, often with troubled pasts. One of them told me, \u201cI had a drug habit, and the only way to support a drug habit is to deal. No one [else] would hire me because of my record.\u201d The first step in collecting, Mr. Wilson told me, is finding the debtor. When creditors can\u2019t collect on unpaid accounts, they often sell them for pennies on the dollar to third-party debt collectors. The seller hands over spreadsheets containing bits of information on debtors. But frequently, those bits are outdated or inaccurate. So collectors have to play detective, searching databases, calling neighbors and contacting family members. The best possible scenario, Mr. Wilson said, is to find a debtor\u2019s scornful ex-spouse: \u201cThey\u2019ll tell you, \u2018Here is his number, here is his mother\u2019s number, here is his slutty girlfriend\u2019s number.\u2019 We will usually put it on mute and say, \u2018We got a rat \u2014 we got a rat!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Once you find debtors, the second step is convincing them to pay. Mr. Wilson insisted that I try it. I wasn\u2019t keen on the prospect of hounding poor people over the telephone. But one collector persuaded me. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll really understand what it\u2019s like,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will give you a pseudonym, like Mark Twain,\u201d Mr. Wilson promised. After consenting to a confidentiality agreement, I put on a headset and logged on to the computer system. On this particular day, the office was using an auto-dialer to call debtors whose contact information had already been verified. On one of my first calls, I connected with a woman who owed money on an old cellphone bill. \u201cI\u2019m calling because I\u2019m trying to follow up on a loan that we had on record for you guys, and I\u2019m wondering whether there\u2019s any way we can set up a payment plan for you,\u201d I told her. As soon as I said it, I knew it was weak. I wouldn\u2019t pay me, if I were her. I tried to recover: \u201cThe balance was at $1,441, which I know is a lot \u2014 there\u2019s a bunch of fees and interest \u2014 but we\u2019re able to...\u201d Mr. Wilson, who was listening in, whispered, \u201cNine hundred dollars.\u201d I continued: \u201c...offer you a settlement fee of 900 bucks, which is about $500 less than the balance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not working right now,\u201d the debtor told me.\u201cWe talk to a lot of folks who are in kind of a similar spot,\u201d I told her. \u201cOne thing that we can work out is a hardship payment plan, where it\u2019s just $50 a month.\u201d The woman told me that she could probably pay me in the middle of the month. She stayed on the line for a few more minutes until, rather abruptly, she hung up.Mr. Wilson launched into his postgame commentary. \u201cYou should have given her our address and made her promise to send the check on the 15th.\u201d This way, \u201cwhen you call her back, you say, \u2018You promised to pay and you didn\u2019t.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Moments later, I was speaking with another woman, who owed several thousand dollars on her credit card. I suggested a payment plan. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to do any of this,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was just answering out of, uh, what would you call it? You know, good manners.\u201d\u201cI really appreciate it,\u201d I told her.\u201cI\u2019m not a deadbeat \u2014 it kind of sounds like I am \u2014 but I just got ill, and that was a long time ago, and I\u2019m barely staying afloat.\u201d She explained that she was bipolar. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to pay other bills either, and then I had no credit.\u201d She told me that she had managed her condition \u201cpretty well,\u201d but added, \u201cI know that I\u2019m getting close to losing it, which would mean going to a hospital and, you know, a recovery period.\u201d Her voice sounded shaky. I forced myself to press on.\u201cIs there any way that you could even set up a modest payment to help pay this off?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you not hearing me?\u201d Then she hung up.I looked back sheepishly at Mr. Wilson.\u201cYou know what you should have said? You should have said: \u2018I understand that these are tough times, and you have been through some hardships, but I got 90-year-old ladies on oxygen who are sending $25 a month, as a show of good faith. So certainly there is something you can do to start paying off this debt.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIt was hard to imagine doing this work full time. On average, bill and account collectors in the United States make $16.66 an hour. Many are in debt themselves. The owner of one agency told me that, quite by chance, he occasionally bought debts that belonged to his own employees. \u201cI call the collector into my office and tell him that he had to start paying me $20 a month,\u201d the owner said. I visited one collection agency, on the impoverished East Side of Buffalo, N.Y., where the employees were paid entirely on commission. One payday, I witnessed two dejected, middle-aged men getting paid for the week: One earned $115 and the other just $88. Inevitably, this induces some collectors to up the ante from persuasion to harassment. According to the Federal Trade Commission, the combined number of complaints about threats of violence and \u201cfalse threats of arrest or seizure of property\u201d from debt collectors more than tripled between 2008 and 2012. It\u2019s tempting to blame the collectors \u2014 and certainly some deserve it \u2014 but the problem is broader. The big banks and other creditors are unloading their unpaid accounts, from their most destitute customers, and selling them on the cheap to debt buyers who, in turn, push their collectors to recoup every last cent. At the corporate level, this can be very profitable. Encore Capital Group, a behemoth in the industry, has seen its revenues soar to $773 million in 2013 from $316 million in 2009. In general, collectors themselves see little of this. Make no mistake about it: This is a battle for scraps. It is middle-class and poor people, being pitted against even poorer people, to the benefit of much richer people. In an attempt to clean up the industry, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is now policing about 175 of the nation\u2019s largest agencies, but according to a recent industry estimate there are 9,677 agencies operating in the country, and roughly 42 percent are small shops with four or fewer employees. The worst actors are often small outfits, which can, if necessary, shut down and open back up, in another place and under another name. In theory, the bureau could go after them, but it doesn\u2019t have the resources to do this on a large scale. This is bad news for consumers, of course, but it\u2019s also bad news for law-abiding collectors because it reinforces the perception that they are ruthless scofflaws. It didn\u2019t take me long to realize that I was a terrible collector. I lacked an easy rapport with the debtors and an innate sense of when to segue from courtship to the unpleasant matter of collecting. Most of all, I lacked something more visceral: the drive and the hunger to make my bonus. I was a comfortable upper-middle-class guy with a house, two cars, and a wife working as a doctor. I knew that if circumstances were different, if I were poorer and worried about my family, then somehow or another I would find a way to collect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When iPhones Ring, the Economy Listens", "Date": "2014-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesGloomy economic news and the wild swings of the stock market may be getting you down. But at least you can count on this: We\u2019ve entered the sweet spot of the iPhone cycle. Since Sept. 19, when the iPhone 6 and its larger sibling, the iPhone 6 Plus, went on sale, consumers have been ordering the gadgets faster than Apple can deliver them. The ripple effects are being felt throughout the economy \u2014 and they have been moving the stock market.\u201cThe iPhone is having a measurable impact,\u201d said Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase. \u201cIt\u2019s a little gadget, but it costs a lot and it seems that everybody has one. When you do the multiplication, it\u2019s going to matter.\u201d He estimates that iPhone sales are adding one-quarter to one-third of a percentage point to the annualized growth rate of the gross domestic product. Whether you love them or not, though, it\u2019s a good moment to recognize their significance as a financial force. This price structure is lucrative for Apple. \u201cThe cost of building a basic phone has stayed at about $200 for years,\u201d said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director for cost benchmarking services, at IHS Technology. That estimate doesn\u2019t include many expenses, like research and marketing costs. But it\u2019s a rough guidepost, and it helps explain how, as Apple disclosed in a court filing two years ago, its profit margins for the iPhone are roughly double those for iPads, which tend to be priced more cheaply. \u201cApple is now so big that it takes a lot to make it grow appreciably,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said. It\u2019s producing an impressive interrelated ecosystem of products and services, including its forthcoming digital watches, its new digital payment system, its revived Mac line, refreshed iPads and new software operating systems. Even if all of its ventures succeed, none are likely in the next year or two to rival the financial impact of the iPhone. \u201cThe iPhone is the core of Apple right now,\u201d he said. In a sense, it\u2019s the core of the stock market as well. Apple is the biggest company, by market capitalization, in the world. Apple accounts for about 3.5 percent of the weighting of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. And, through Thursday, because its stock has performed magnificently while the overall market has not, Apple accounted for 18 percent of the entire rise of the S.&P. 500 index this year, according to calculations by Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. And the engine driving Apple shares is the iPhone. \u201cThe market is obviously counting on another strong sales performance for the new iPhone,\u201d he said. So far, it\u2019s getting that performance. And, he said, Apple\u2019s invigorating effect is likely to continue. Because the iPhone is made mainly overseas and sold worldwide, it is stimulating the economy in other regions, particular in East Asia, Mr. Feroli observed, and it keeps a substantial amount of its cash abroad. Such factors make it harder to assess the company\u2019s impact domestically. \u201cIt\u2019s not like G.M. having a great quarter,\u201d Mr. Feroli said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t translate directly into employment in the United States. It\u2019s a more complex world today, and, in that sense, Apple is representative of that world.\u201dEven people who don\u2019t buy iPhones and don\u2019t own Apple shares have a stake in the company. I don\u2019t own any Apple stock, for example, but I do have a stake indirectly through my 401(k) account. That\u2019s because mutual funds in my portfolio own Apple shares as their biggest holdings. Nearly every pension fund holds some stock, and these days, there\u2019s a good chance the biggest holding is Apple. And the most important financial lever at Apple is the iPhone.All of that helps explain why Apple is such a formidable force, especially at this stage in its product cycle. And as the holiday shopping season approaches, and iPhones keep flying off the shelves, Apple may well keep moving the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Motivational Speaker Finds Eager Audiences in a Struggling Iran", "Date": "2014-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTehran JournalTEHRAN \u2014 Artificial smoke belched from machines and loud house music filled Tehran\u2019s most prestigious auditorium, as Ahmad Hellat, a source of inspiration for many Iranians, appeared simultaneously on three enormous video screens, wearing a blue tracksuit and driving a scooter.Like a latter-day Norman Vincent Peale extolling the virtues of positive thinking, he was there to provide the assembled hope for a happy and successful life, something in short supply for many in the Islamic republic, where rules can be suffocating and economic prospects are grim.\u201cMay a shower of gold rain on your heads!\u201d he told his audience of about 1,800 fans in the videotaped message, as a welcoming introduction. \u201cI am Dr. Hellat and I am handsome, rich and powerful, and you can be too, if you just repeat those magical words. How are you doing?\u201d\u201cGreat,\u201d the audience thundered in unison, a response they had learned during Mr. Hellat\u2019s many seminars. Life, says Mr. Hellat, who is not actually a doctor but is working toward a Ph.D. in psychology, is all about love, positive thinking and prosperity.Iranians, many in dire need of a lift in spirits, are eating it up.Thirty-five years after the Islamic revolution, with the furor and high hopes of that time long since diminished and with an economy seemingly stuck in neutral, life for many, if not most, Iranians has settled into a dreary routine of increasing hopelessness about the future.\u201cWe cannot deny what we see around us,\u201d said Mr. Hellat, 51, during a recent interview in his office. Next to his collection of chrome pipes stood a framed poster of a stack of hundred-dollar bills and reading, \u201cMy First Billion.\u201d\u201cThe basis of most problems is a financial aspiration that cannot be met,\u201d he said. The key to happiness, therefore, is success and money, he concluded.Shiite Muslim clerics traditionally are the ones who advise Iranians on how to eat, pray and love in Iran, and Mr. Hellat is careful to emphasize that his teaching in no way supplants religion. \u201cWhat I do is motivational psychology, this is something completely different,\u201d he said.In the Tehran Milad Tower auditorium last Wednesday, Iranians from all walks of life had paid roughly $20 for four hours of life lessons during \u201cThe Great Festival of Positive Energy.\u201d Most of them were readers of Mr. Hellat\u2019s \u201cMoavaghiat,\u201d or success, magazine, which is one of the most popular in the country.Finally, Mr. Hellat himself strides onto the stage wearing a black suit, shiny shoes and a microphone stuck to his ear so he can gesture freely with his hands. \u201cI want to teach you 30 techniques of success that will explode like a bomb,\u201d he shouts. The stage was designed with \u201cplus\u201d symbols, signs of positivity. \u201cSuccess is waiting for you, you just have to grab it.\u201dThe audience, a wide mix of middle-class Iranians, stared up at him with greedy expectation. Women in traditional chadors, the all-black veil that covers everything but the face and hands, scribbled notes as Mr. Hellat spoke. Young couples held hands tightly when he said that lives can be changed. Friends whispered in each others\u2019 ears as the \u201cDoctor\u201d again urged everybody to clap and shout that they were feeling great.Iranians, during their thousands of years as a civilization, have always looked for leaders to guide them, not only in politics but also in matters of daily life. Mr. Hellat left no detail unmentioned on the road to success.\u201cMen! Shine your shoes, it is the first thing women look at,\u201d he said from the stage. \u201cAre you fat? No problem, but at least wear suitable clothes, so that you look presentable.\u201dBorrowing freely from American motivational speakers like Anthony Robbins, Mr. Hellat managed to get the crowd going wild; at least, as wild as you can get in the Islamic republic, where dancing in public is forbidden. Men wearing bow ties and crisp suits clapped their hands to the beats of a song called \u201cIbiza,\u201d after the Spanish party island, while women covered in colorful scarves moved in their seats.Iranians, skilled in the art of adaptation and survival, immediately stopped clapping, which is considered un-Islamic by some hard-liners. Some women started refitting their headscarves, so that they would not show too much hair.As the music died down, like a deflating balloon, Mr. Hellat disappeared backstage, only to come out half a minute later, sporting a big smile. \u201cWe welcome Hojatoleslam Ali Razini, one of the highest members of Iran\u2019s judiciary,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry people, you are allowed to clap in front of him!\u201d\u201cEverybody praise the prophet!\u201d Mr. Hellat urged in response.A female ventriloquist entered the stage with a doll named \u201cCan Do,\u201d who told the audience that they must always believe in themselves.Mr. Hellat decided it was time to recapture the lost attention. \u201cLet\u2019s all be calm and do a breathing exercise,\u201d he suggested, explaining that it was much better to breathe from the stomach. \u201cJoin me, everybody join me,\u201d he said. \u201cAh, that feels good no?\u201d Soon even the cleric could be seen focusing on the breathing exercise.In the corridors of the auditorium, fans took advantage of the quiet to rush to the bathrooms. \u201cWe tape all his speeches, so we can listen to them over and over again,\u201d said Abuzar Raesi, 34, who had driven for 10 hours from the city of Shiraz with his pregnant wife. \u201cWe felt defeated in our lives before we met the doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we feel full of energy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Megarich Plaintiffs, Legally Adrift", "Date": "2014-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySO this is the thanks that Uncle Sam gets.Six years after a forceful rescue of the financial system (and, derivatively, the economy) by two presidents and the Federal Reserve, a megarich individual and a battalion of investment funds are claiming unfair treatment and trying to extract billions in undeserved riches.Call it by its proper name: extortion.The weapon of choice is litigation \u2014 expensive, time-consuming court battles that have chewed through millions of dollars of taxpayer money in fees and countless hours of government officials\u2019 time.For the past few weeks, a trial has been underway in a Washington courtroom on one suit, the claim of Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of American International Group, that the harsh terms on which funds were provided to the company amounted to an unconstitutional taking of shareholders\u2019 property.His argument, simplified: The federal government saved other institutions on less onerous terms, so A.I.G. should have gotten one of those better deals. As a legal matter, that\u2019s irrelevant. What\u2019s relevant is that in 2008, no private capital would touch A.I.G., and without taxpayer money, A.I.G. would have collapsed, declared bankruptcy and liquidated itself. Mr. Greenberg would have received even less, i.e., nothing.That\u2019s why the directors of A.I.G. voluntarily accepted the government\u2019s rescue package.The litigation against the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are government-sponsored entities, is more complicated but equally meritless.In September 2008, with losses mounting at Fannie and Freddie, the Treasury put the two huge lenders into conservatorship and ultimately pumped nearly $200 billion into them.In 2012, the complex arrangement was restructured to provide that Treasury would forgo dividends and instead receive profits from these companies.Since then, some hedge funds and other investment vehicles have been braying that the original deal should be reinstated, thereby allowing the investor group to collect a share of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s current large profits.But here\u2019s the key point: The 2008 legislation that enabled the conservatorship gave the government sweeping powers and limited the ability of the courts to second guess.From that moment, all investors were well on notice that the companies would no longer be operated for the benefit of private shareholders.Then there\u2019s the ultimate chutzpah: Some of the funds bought their shares after the agreement was amended in 2012 and still expect to reap a windfall at taxpayer expense.The government is also on strong moral ground. All the profits that Fannie and Freddie are now making are thanks to the government, which continues to implicitly guarantee the debt that the companies sell.Happily, none of the cases have gone well for the plaintiffs. Mr. Greenberg has lost at every turn; the Supreme Court wouldn\u2019t even hear his case. Meanwhile, a Federal District Court judge just handed the Fannie and Freddie adversaries a stinging defeat, harshly dismissing four of the suits.Seeking a more sympathetic ear, both sets of plaintiffs also sued in a little-known branch of the judiciary, the Court of Federal Claims.Because the claims court was established in the 19th century as a \u201cpeople\u2019s court,\u201d where individuals or small businesses would have recourse to challenge the government on matters such as taxes and contracts, predicting the outcome of these legally creative cases is particularly difficult.But even if the plaintiffs prevail in the Court of Federal Claims, the government can appeal through the main federal court system, where Mr. Greenberg and the funds have yet to notch a win.These two high-profile cases are not alone; there are at least a dozen related cases against Fannie and Freddie winding through the courts.And lawsuits stemming from the auto rescue have been filed by aggrieved automobile dealers and by pensioners of a formerly bankrupt supplier, Delphi. While the plaintiffs may be more sympathetic figures, having led the president\u2019s auto task force, I believe these claims are equally specious.Like any defendant, the government can compromise and settle litigation. But with the merits so clear, it should remain true to the principle of \u201cmillions for defense, but not one cent for tribute.\u201dAs a longtime denizen of Wall Street, I\u2019m firmly on the side of investors trying to make money.But in this case, Mr. Greenberg and the funds should consider how hard to press on this. Average Americans already feel distaste for Wall Street and rich people; bringing these rapacious lawsuits can only unnecessarily exacerbate class tensions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Malloy and Foley, Nasty Tone in Connecticut Governor\u2019s Debate", "Date": "2014-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisplaying a ferocity that has come to define this razor-thin race, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut assailed his Republican opponent, Thomas C. Foley, in a debate on Thursday night that focused mainly on the issues of taxes, government transparency and the state\u2019s efforts to woo corporations.The hourlong debate \u2014 the fifth in a series of often-stinging encounters \u2014 renewed the tensions of a campaign that has implications for national leaders of both major parties. Already one of the tightest contests for governor in the country, the race has recently narrowed to a draw as party leaders, including Bill Clinton and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, visit the state.Within Connecticut, the campaign is being viewed as a test of President Obama\u2019s agenda on matters such as stricter gun control measures and a higher minimum wage, priorities that Mr. Malloy has championed.The governor, by turns feisty and professorial, fended off Mr. Foley\u2019s attacks over his handling of Connecticut\u2019s economy and his support for one of the nation\u2019s toughest gun laws. While Mr. Foley sometimes appeared more tentative than he had in other debates, he sought again to cast a harsh light on Mr. Malloy\u2019s response to the state\u2019s still-flagging economy, including the governor\u2019s decisions to raise taxes and negotiate $1.6 billion in public union concessions.Chiding Mr. Malloy for Connecticut\u2019s sluggish economic growth, Mr. Foley said: \u201cYou did run this state into a ditch. You\u2019ve broken this economy.\u201d He added, \u201cYou simply don\u2019t have solutions.\u201dThe governor was unbowed. Capitalizing on an opportunity to highlight the callous corporate maneuvers that he has said characterized Mr. Foley\u2019s career as a private-equity manager, Mr. Malloy cast his opponent as out of touch with ordinary residents.\u201cI didn\u2019t lose 3,000 jobs on a company that I owned,\u201d Mr. Malloy said. \u201cI didn\u2019t move jobs to Mexico. I don\u2019t own a $10 million house and a $5 million boat and a $1 million plane and not pay taxes in the state of Connecticut. That\u2019s not who I am.\u201dThe debut of an independent candidate, Joe Visconti, who has run on an anti-gun-control platform and was participating in his first debate, exerted a surprisingly leveling influence on the event, as he doled out complaints to the candidates in almost equal servings. His ominous vision of \u201ctidal waves of deficit\u201d kept attention on the governor\u2019s economic record, an opening that Mr. Foley was quick to exploit.Complaining about what he called overly generous state investments in corporations during Mr. Malloy\u2019s tenure, Mr. Foley said, \u201cThe idea of the governor and his staff negotiating with a very sophisticated group of businesspeople \u2014 I\u2019m a little worried for Connecticut taxpayers.\u201dThe tone of the campaign has grown increasingly nasty lately, both in television commercials and in the debates. Mr. Foley, whose muffled voice has not softened his crisp attack on the state\u2019s slow economic gains, has fixated on a tax increase that he argues hurt middle-class residents badly. Unwilling to yield, Mr. Malloy has portrayed Mr. Foley as a cold and uncompromising former private-equity manager who has kept voters in the dark about his economic plans.Thursday\u2019s encounter \u2014 which was held at the Garde Arts Center in New London and sponsored by WNPR, Connecticut Public Television and New London\u2019s newspaper, The Day \u2014 was only slightly more civil. Mr. Foley, trying to retake the upper hand as polls show Mr. Malloy erasing his slim lead, listing corporations he said had eliminated jobs in Connecticut over the last three and a half years.Mr. Malloy countered that the decision to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in businesses had preserved jobs in the state. Somewhat awkwardly, he specifically defended his dealings with Pfizer by noting that the daughter of the company\u2019s president \u201cwas an intern on one of my campaigns.\u201dMr. Malloy is trying to rekindle support among voters who made him Connecticut\u2019s first Democratic governor since 1986, but have since shown him only tepid affection. Meanwhile, Mr. Foley, who lost to the governor in a close race four years ago, is seeking for a second time to overcome what Democrats portray as the stigma of his wealth and capitalize on continuing frustration over the economy.Mr. Foley\u2019s standing seems to have been hurt most by the race\u2019s negative spiral, if only because Connecticut voters have long been lukewarm to the economic policies that have been a centerpiece of his attacks on the governor.Displaying a doggedness that he honed as a Brooklyn prosecutor earlier in his career, Mr. Malloy used the debate\u2019s loose format to interrogate Mr. Foley directly, especially over dueling accusations about both campaigns\u2019 adherence to clean election laws.His confidence undiminished, Mr. Foley concluded with a broad challenge to the audience. \u00a0\u201cIf you think Governor Malloy is doing a good job and that Connecticut is making progress under his leadership, you should vote for him,\u201d he said.In a sign that the dare did not go over as intended, whoops of applause rose from the crowd.\u00a0Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Brazil\u2019s Election, a Stark Vote on the Nation\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseSunday\u2019s presidential election in Brazil may be too close to call, but investors have already voted with their reais and dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s A\u00e9cio Neves in a landslide.Rarely, if ever, has such a pro-growth, market-friendly candidate emerged as a serious presidential contender in a developing country, let alone one as large and influential as Brazil, which has the world\u2019s seventh-largest economy as measured by gross domestic product. With every twist in the polls, the Brazilian stock market surges (if Mr. Neves is ahead) or plunges (if not) while largely ignoring fundamentals like commodity prices, the faltering Brazilian economy or global crises.Perhaps nothing has more endeared Mr. Neves to investors than his announcement on Oct. 5, right after qualifying for this weekend\u2019s presidential runoff, that he would name Arminio Fraga his finance minister. Mr. Fraga is an unabashed champion of market capitalism and pro-growth government policies. He has a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton and drew international praise as the head of Brazil\u2019s central bank from 1999 to 2002, steering the Brazilian economy through a difficult period that coincided with the implosion of the dot-com bubble and a recession in the United States. He was a managing director at George Soros\u2019s fund in New York, and after leaving Brazil\u2019s central bank, he helped start the hedge fund G\u00e1vea Investimentos. A unit of JPMorgan Chase acquired a controlling stake in 2010.Neither Mr. Neves nor Mr. Fraga is backing down. \u201cBy any standard, we represent a pro-market, pro-growth approach,\u201d Mr. Fraga told me when I spoke with him this week between campaign stops. That this would be resonating with voters in populist Latin America, a region better known for flamboyant leftists like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela and Fidel Castro in Cuba, seems remarkable. But Mr. Fraga said the close race was less a verdict on economic ideology than a strong desire for change. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t motivated by a deep knowledge of economics and what drives growth and productivity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they know that Brazil needs to change to get back on the growth path or it can\u2019t sustain its employment levels and social benefits. And some people are just fed up with all the scandals.\u201dNo wonder investors are applauding Mr. Neves. As governor of Brazil\u2019s second-most-populous state from 2003 to 2010, Mr. Neves cut his own pay nearly in half, balanced the budget and turned years of mounting deficits into a surplus. The World Bank has extolled him as a model of fiscal responsibility and extended his state a billion-dollar loan in 2008. Although he alienated the state teachers union by linking their salaries to performance, Mr. Neves left office in 2010 with a 92 percent approval rating. His telegenic good looks, marriage to a glamorous former model and the birth of adorable twins last month haven\u2019t hurt his appeal.In contrast, the incumbent, Ms. Rousseff, is a former Marxist guerrilla who praises Mr. Ch\u00e1vez as \u201ca great Latin American.\u201d In the four years since she was elected, annual growth in G.D.P. has plunged from 7.5 percent to near zero, and Brazil may already be in recession. Inflation has jumped to 6.75 percent. During her tenure, the Brazilian stock market has dropped about a third after years of robust gains. In 2013, millions took to the streets to protest higher bus fares and government corruption. Ms. Rousseff has promised, if re-elected, to replace her minister of finance, Guido Mantega, but, according to Mr. Marconini, \u201ceveryone knows that the real minister of finance was Dilma herself.\u201dCritics say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s shortcomings have been especially manifest at Petrobras, the giant oil company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian government. Shares in Petrobras have been especially volatile during the campaign, and \u201care basically a call option on the election,\u201d said Allen Good, a research analyst who follows Petrobras for Morningstar.Ms. Rousseff was chairwoman of Petrobras from 2003 to 2010, and as president of Brazil, appoints its chief executive and controls the board. \u201cPetrobras was once highly respected and well run,\u201d Mr. Good said. \u201cIt was technically capable. But the government has pretty much destroyed the company in the past five years.\u201dMr. Fraga said cleaning up Petrobras would be a top priority of a Neves presidency. Ms. Rousseff has imposed price controls on Petrobras to keep retail gas prices and inflation low, but Mr. Fraga said that would change if Mr. Neves were elected. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in price controls, period,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a widespread feeling that the company has been run by political appointees who aren\u2019t competent and are corrupt. There has to be an overhaul of Petrobras to make it well run and transparent. That\u2019s long overdue.\u201dMr. Fraga said Mr. Neves would bring his \u201cshock management\u201d approach to Brazil\u2019s sprawling federal bureaucracy. He would restore fiscal discipline, curb inflation and stop interfering with the central bank, which Mr. Fraga predicted would lead to lower interest rates and renewed economic growth. Mr. Neves has promised major investment in infrastructure, where \u201cthe needs are phenomenal\" Mr. Fraga said. Tax reform is another priority.\u201cThis is very doable,\u201d Mr. Fraga said. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science. We will have to deliver. We need a combination of a market-friendly approach and better execution. It\u2019s a mix of ideology and management.\u201dCan Mr. Neves and Mr. Fraga pull off what would have to be considered a major political upset? In Latin America, incumbent presidents have almost never lost re-election bids, even in the middle of economic and political crises. The most recent polls are mixed.But polls before the first round of voting grossly underestimated Mr. Neves\u2019s support, perhaps because many voters fear retaliation from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ruling Workers Party should she be re-elected.Still, if Mr. Neves loses, \u201cit will be a crushing blow\u201d to investors and business people in Brazil, Mr. Marconini of Teneo Intelligence said, and markets are likely to fall further. \u201cIt will be especially disappointing because he got their hopes up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really looked like he could win.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the law is not a referendum on the independence of Catalonia (as it was in Scotland). The formal request for such a binding referendum was turned down by the Spanish Parliament on April 8. This new law explicitly states that it is a nonbinding consultation of the Catalan people, legal under Catalan law and the Spanish Constitution. It is designed to gauge opinion on three possible alternatives for Catalonia: maintaining the status quo, moving toward a federal-type government or moving toward an independent state.Second, the reasons for the rapidly rising pace of the independence movement in Catalonia go beyond the refusal of the Spanish government to discuss fiscal issues. They also include Spain\u2019s 2010 rejection of the terms of a new Catalan Statute (Constitution) proposing a framework for the satisfactory integration of Catalonia into Spain, the central government\u2019s continued efforts to diminish Catalan educational and language rights and the repeated refusals to allow a vote to take place.Vicen\u00e7 Ferrer, WashingtonWe Brits are in for a wild rideRe \u201cActing like the front-runner\u201d (News, Oct. 7): Steven Erlanger concludes that Britain\u2019s Labour Party \u201cis more likely to provide stability\u201d than the Conservative Party.

That strategy also bolstered our economy and helped our manufacturing base shift from war production to a peaceful one. The result was a booming economy.

The last 10 years have witnessed a very weak dollar in comparison to those golden years. European companies, dependent on exports to the United States, have indeed experienced (and still do) a crippling decline in business due to the weak buying power of the dollar. Perhaps this is all a matter of historical perspective, but to label the dollar as \u201cstrong\u201d right now is to be historically myopic.Catherine Monteiro de Barros, Hawling, EnglandAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the U.S. Has Fallen Behind in Internet Speed and Affordability", "Date": "2014-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the Slow LaneAmerica\u2019s slow and expensive Internet is more than just an annoyance for people trying to watch \u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d on Netflix. Largely a consequence of monopoly providers, the sluggish service could have long-term economic consequences for American competitiveness.The reason the United States lags many countries in both speed and affordability, according to people who study the issue, has nothing to do with technology. Instead, it is an economic policy problem \u2014 the lack of competition in the broadband industry.The situation arose from this conundrum: Left alone, will companies compete, or is regulation necessary?In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission in 2002 reclassified high-speed Internet access as an information service, which is unregulated, rather than as telecommunications, which is regulated. Its hope was that Internet providers would compete with one another to provide the best networks. That didn\u2019t happen. The result has been that they have mostly stayed out of one another\u2019s markets.When New America ranked cities by the average speed of broadband plans priced between $35 and $50 a month, the top three cities, Seoul, Hong Kong and Paris, offered speeds 10 times faster than the United States cities. (In some places, like Seoul, the government subsidizes Internet access to keep prices low.)The divide is not just with the fastest plans. At nearly every speed, Internet access costs more in the United States than in Europe, according to the report. American Internet users are also much more likely than those in other countries to pay an additional fee, about $100 a year in many cities, to rent a modem that costs less than $100 in a store.In certain cities, the threat of new Internet providers has spurred the big, existing companies to do something novel: increase the speeds they offer and build up their own fiber networks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Loss of Altitude at the Quarter\u2019s Close ", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBLACK swans \u2014 those rare, disastrous events that can derail bull markets \u2014 were thought to be lurking everywhere during the third quarter, from China to Ukraine to the Middle East \u2014 even Scotland. Yet stock indexes rose for nearly the entire period, continually setting record highs.The advance all but evaporated in the waning days, however, as some of the swans still threatened to make an appearance and new ones were glimpsed in places like Hong Kong and Newport Beach, Calif. It was no help, either, that the bird-watchers on Wall Street began to focus their gaze on another unwelcome creature: a hawk.Economic growth has been erratic for a long time, with prosperity just around a corner that never seems to be reached. Investors haven\u2019t minded, because companies have taken steps \u2014 cutting costs, executing stock buybacks \u2014 to increase earnings and because the Federal Reserve has maintained an aggressively relaxed monetary policy. But with the Fed expected to end its asset purchases this month and perhaps raise interest rates at some point in 2015, investment advisers say, there is a sense that the economy had better prove soon that it has traction. An apparent willingness to keep giving the Fed and the economy the benefit of the doubt sent the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to a record close of 2,011.36 on Sept. 18. That was the day that Scotland voted not to separate from the United Kingdom \u2014 a relief to investors, as was the absence of appreciable exacerbation of the Ukraine conflict and the economic slowdown in China. Over the final seven trading days of the quarter, the S.&P. 500 erased nearly all of its earlier 3 percent gain, ending at 1,972.29, up just 0.6 percent. Other indexes were mixed. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.9 percent, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies declined 7.7 percent. Treasury yields were flat during the period, with the 10-year note yielding 2.5 percent. Other bonds fared much worse, on price; high-yield instruments had their biggest rise in yields, to 6.3 percent from 5.3 percent, for any quarter since 2011.Portfolio managers and market strategists agree with Mr. Toohey that evidence of a steeper economic growth trajectory will have to emerge soon to keep the rally going in stocks and high-yield bonds. There is little consensus on whether it will.Mr. Toohey occupies the middle ground. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a pickup, but not the acceleration that people on Wall Street are expecting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think there will be some improvements in the labor market and manufacturing, particularly in the energy area.\u201dIf forecasts are all over the place, it could be because recent readings have been, too. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the second quarter after contracting at a 2.1 percent rate in the previous period. Forecasts for the just-ended quarter cluster around 3 percent growth; the Bureau of Economic Analysis will issue its first reading of several on Oct. 30.On the bright side, the number of claims for unemployment benefits continued to decline steadily. Skeptics, however, pointed to persistently lethargic consumer spending, as well as to recent manufacturing and consumer confidence surveys that came in weaker than forecast, and evidence that the recovery in housing has run its course.\u00a0Sales of previously owned homes were 5.3 percent lower in August than a year earlier, with declines for every price group except $1 million-plus homes, according to the National Association of Realtors, though the average sales price was 4.8 percent higher.The picture may be mixed, but fund performance was negative nearly across the board. The average domestic equity fund tracked by Morningstar was down 1.8 percent in the quarter, depressed by declines exceeding 5 percent in the three categories covering small companies. Among portfolios that focus on a single sector, just 3 of 10 groups \u2014 consumer staples, technology and health \u2014 showed an average gain. Bond funds were down 0.8 percent, attributable largely to declines of 2 percent in high-yield portfolios and 2.9 percent in emerging-market portfolios. Municipal bond funds were a bright spot, with an average return of 1.5 percent.THE greater urgency for signs of a perkier domestic economy may stem not only from fears of hawks at the Fed but also from an albatross in Europe. Economic conditions there have been noticeably more feeble than elsewhere through most of the recovery. Recent indications of a new descent toward recession, if borne out, could drag the world economy lower again.In one of the latest signs of deterioration, the European Union reported an increase of 0.3 percent in consumer prices in the 12 months through September, the lowest reading since 2009. Producer prices fell 1.4 percent in the 12 months through August, the most recent reading.Eurozone unemployment was 11.5 percent in August, the same as in the previous two months and higher than at any point in the Great Recession. As the third quarter was ending, Germany, the largest European economy, reported that the number of jobless rose 12,000 in September, above the average forecast of 2,000.Poor performance by European stocks, combined with a sharp decline in the euro, which reduces the dollar value of European assets, resulted in a decline of 7.3 percent for European stock funds in the quarter. It also helped send the average international stock fund to a loss of 4.6 percent. Asia stock funds fared better but still lost 2.2 percent; emerging-market stock funds were down 3.5 percent. The malaise in Europe, and the reduced expectations that it has engendered, could work to investors\u2019 advantage, Mr. Maxwell said.\u201cThere was hope coming into the year that Europe was coming out of recession,\u201d he recalled. \u201cPeople were hoping for 2 percent to 2.5 percent growth. Now they\u2019re facing 1 percent growth, so it\u2019s easier to beat expectations at the margin. The U.S. is probably as good as it\u2019s going to get. Europe seems as bad as it\u2019s going to get.\u201dWith that in mind, Mr. Maxwell encourages investors to consider shares of Europe-based multinational producers of consumer staples. Demand for such staples \u2014 food, drink, tobacco, household items \u2014 tends to remain stable in any economic backdrop, and the cheap euro makes European companies\u2019 products more competitive abroad, helping to bolster earnings at home.He also likes European carmakers and ad agencies. Elsewhere, he is hopeful about Chinese, South Korean and Mexican stocks. He is negative on Japan, but less so than usual, he said, because \u201cthe government is desperate to get asset prices up and valuations have come off quite a bit.\u201d As for bonds, with yields on government issues near historical lows nearly everywhere, he finds them too expensive relative to stocks.\u201cChina is trying to rebalance the economy without causing a recession and finding it impossible to do so,\u201d he said. Nevertheless, for investors \u201cthere are opportunities in areas that the government says it\u2019s going to focus on, related to domestic demand.\u201dEconomic reform is a big theme for Mr. Smithie. He favors markets where strong efforts are being made, as in India and Indonesia, and says he is avoiding laggards like Turkey and Russia.\u201cThe problem right now is where do you invest when nothing\u2019s cheap and cash pays 1 percent,\u201d he said. Stock market valuations \u201care at their highest levels in four or five years,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cHigh-yield bonds have had a very nice run for a long period, but with interest rates as low as they are, there\u2019s probably more embedded risk than in quite some time.\u201d Rather than picking asset classes, Mr. Linehan would assess investments one or a few at a time. He highlighted narrow niches such as refineries, pipeline operators and other beneficiaries of the American energy production boom, as well as firms that can create online brands that successfully challenge the dominance of conventional retailers.Mr. Auth at Federated expressed far more bullishness than others toward stocks. \u201cWe expect the market to go a lot higher, with corrections along the way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very heavily in equities and want to be overweight in names likely to benefit from the economic improvement we see ahead.\u201dExamples include the technology, energy, heavy industrial and consumer-discretionary sectors. By contrast, he would limit exposure to consumer staples, which he finds expensive, and to utilities, because he expects interest rates to rise. He added that \u201cwe\u2019re starting to nibble in Japan and Europe, but we still think the big story is the U.S.\u201dMr. Toohey questions whether the next episode of that story will have the happy ending that Mr. Auth envisions, especially if there is an unpleasant plot twist. He warns investors to remain vigilant for black swans.\u201cAre the economy and stock market in a position to withstand a big shock when one comes?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are, and part of life is surprises and shocks.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To French, Nobel Prizes Show That Talk of Country\u2019s Decline Is Premature", "Date": "2014-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byParis Journal\u201cAfter Patrick Modiano, another Frenchman in the firmament: Congratulations to Jean Tirole!\u201d Mr. Valls wrote. \u201cWhat a way to thumb one\u2019s nose at French bashing! #ProudofFrance.\u201dSome in the country were already giddy after Mr. Modiano, a beloved author, whose concise and moody novels are often set in France during the Nazi occupation, won the Nobel Prize for literature last week. The award helped to raise the global stature of Mr. Modiano, whose three books published in the United States \u2014 two novels and a children\u2019s book \u2014 before the Nobel had collectively sold fewer than 8,000 copies.Joining in the chorus, Le Monde suggested in an editorial that at a time of rampant French-bashing, Mr. Modiano\u2019s achievement was something of a vindication for a country where Nobel Prizes in literature flow more liberally than oil. Mr. Modiano was the 15th French writer, including Sartre and Camus, to win the award.Even Mr. Modiano may have unintentionally captured the national mood when, informed of his prize by his editor, he said he found it \u201cstrange\u201d and wanted to know why the Nobel committee had selected him.Alain Finkielkraut, a professor of philosophy at the elite \u00c9cole Polytechnique, who recently published a book criticizing what he characterized as France\u2019s descent into conformity and multiculturalism, said that rather than showing that France was on the ascent, the fetishizing of the Nobel Prizes by the French political elite revealed the country\u2019s desperation.\u201cI find the idea that the Nobels are being used as a riposte to French-bashing idiotic,\u201d he said. \u201cOur education system is totally broken, and the Nobel Prize doesn\u2019t change anything. I have a lot of affection for Mr. Modiano, but I think Philip Roth deserved it much more. To talk that all in France is going well and that the pessimism is gone is absurd. France is doing extremely badly. There is an economic crisis. There is a crisis of integration. I am not going to be consoled by these medals made of chocolate.\u201dRobert Frank, a history professor emeritus at the University of Paris 1 \u2014 Sorbonne, and the author of \u201cThe Fear of Decline, France From 1914 to 2014,\u201d echoed that the self-aggrandizement that had greeted the prizes among the French establishment reflected a country lacking in self-confidence. In earlier centuries, he noted, the prize had been greeted as something obvious.When French writers or intellectuals won Nobels in the mid-20th century, \u201cthere was no jolt at that time, because France still saw itself as important, so there wasn\u2019t much to add to that,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, it may help some people to show that France still counts in certain places in the world. This doesn\u2019t fix the crisis of unemployment, however, that is sapping this society.\u201dMr. Tirole\u2019s work gained particular attention after the 2008 financial crisis, which revealed problems in the regulation of financial firms in the United States and Europe.But some noted the paradox of the award going to an economist from a nation where the economy was less than shimmering, and where many businesses and critics bemoan a culture of excessive red tape.Others like Sean Safford, an associate professor of economic sociology at Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris, the elite institute for political studies known as Sciences Po, said the awarding of the prize to Mr. Tirole, a professor of economics at the University of Toulouse in France, was notable for coming at a time of economic malaise and brain drain, when so many of the country\u2019s brightest are emigrating elsewhere in Europe or to the United States. \u201cThe average French person, who is struggling to pay the bills, is not going to rejoice,\u201d he said.At a time when France is trying to overhaul its social model amid withering resistance to change, others said the award had laid bare the country\u2019s abiding stratification between a small, hyper-educated elite and the rest of the country.Peter Gumbel, a British journalist living in France who most recently wrote a book on French elitism, said that while the prize would provide some sense of national validation, the two men did not reflect the country as a whole.\u201cUndoubtedly the French ecosystem produces incredibly smart people at the very top end, who are capable of winning prizes, and who fall into a grand tradition, and that is what the French school system is geared to produce,\u201d he said.As for the prizes countering French-bashing, he added, \u201cThe French are the biggest bashers of France themselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And because it\u2019s well broken in, she doesn\u2019t worry that he will ruin it. \u201cI have to have a home that is not too precious, with a son and two dogs,\u201d she said.Ms. Dameron and her husband, Keven Matsuzaka, 34, a one-time sushi chef who is now a stay-at-home dad, moved recently from a one-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace to their two-bedroom walk-up because they wanted Otto to have his own room.\u201cThat was paramount,\u201d she said, adding that good light was a requirement and the washer/dryer and bathtub were an added bonus. \u201cHis room is just big enough for a crib and a changing table, but I love that he has a window that looks out on treetops.\u201dAmong the few other modernist elements in her apartment are the sleek Vitsoe 606 library-style bookshelves designed by Dieter Rams of Germany in 1960. \u201cI\u2019ve long coveted them and I finally had the space,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a serious collector of books and magazines, bookshelves are very important to me.\u201dMs. Dameron worked from 2001 to 2005 at Architectural Digest, and she has filled several shelves with issues from the 1970s and 1980s. \u201cI refer to them all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are a great record of an important era.\u201dThe bookshelves are punctuated with things that remind her and Mr. Matsuzaka (who is half Japanese) of their childhoods in Cincinnati, such as wooden kokeshi dolls that belonged to his paternal grandmother and the Kodak Brownie Fun Saver movie camera that belonged to his maternal grandfather, who was an engineer with Kodak. \u201cWe have a lot of objects from our grandparents because we are very close to them and we don\u2019t have any family in New York, so they\u2019re important for Otto and ourselves.\u201d There is also a traditional Uncle Sam mechanical bank that belonged to Ms. Dameron\u2019s father. \u201cWhen you put a penny in his hand it drops immediately into the U.S. bag and his chin starts wagging,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had that everywhere I\u2019ve ever lived. We put it in our history and philosophy section.\u201dOn a lower shelf, a copy of the children\u2019s book \u201cThe Snowy Day\u201d by Ezra Jack Keats is displayed on an easel like a work of art. \u201cI love the graphics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was one of my favorite books growing up, and seeing it always takes me back to my childhood.\u201dBefore moving to New York, Ms. Dameron lived in other hot neighborhoods \u2014 Silverlake in Los Angeles and the Mission in San Francisco \u2014 and she\u2019s besotted with Park Slope. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live anywhere else,\u201d she said. \u201cI love how in a block I can walk to get my shoes fixed, go to a hardware store, get an orange or have a painting framed.

It makes me feel good to support the local economy.\u201dAs for residential design, Ms. Dameron thinks honesty is the best policy. She stresses that Dwell strives for verisimilitude by never styling the homes it photographs. \u201cWe tell the people not to spend $1,000 on flowers and not make it look like they don\u2019t live there,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tell them to make it look like they\u2019re having a good friend over for dinner.

{"Headline": "Who Will Lead the Senate? Follow the Prediction Markets", "Date": "2014-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThere\u2019s a lot of upside for Republicans in this election cycle, and very little downside, as eight Democrats are defending winning margins from the last election of 10 points or less. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, is the only Republican in this perilous position.In addition, midterm elections typically spell bad news for the party in control of the White House. Ever since World War II, the president\u2019s party has, on average, lost a net four Senate seats in midterm races.To be sure, there\u2019s debate about how much the economy has improved. Even as unemployment has fallen, the proportion of the population with a job has barely risen, gross domestic product is merely puttering along, and wages are barely rising for most workers.Of course, these economic fundamentals matter only to the extent that they affect voters, which raises the question of how best to make sense of polls. The basic rules for interpreting economic statistics also apply to polling data: Big samples beat small samples, and a dashboard of indicators is more convincing than any single survey, which is why it\u2019s important to aggregate information from many pollsters.How should you combine insights from the basic political factors \u2014 the state of the economy, opinion polls and voter expectations? Economics doesn\u2019t provide a formula, but rather a suggestion: Turn to political prediction markets where people trade securities linked to election outcomes. When many people make trades based on their individual perspectives, the price comes to reflect each of the most relevant factors, effectively weighting each by the confidence that traders have in them.This economist\u2019s bottom line, then, is that there\u2019s a 69 percent chance that Republicans will win the Senate. This forecast is clear, it\u2019s precise, it\u2019s quantitative (in that it acknowledges and specifies uncertainty), and it\u2019s easily evaluated. In other words, it\u2019s terrible punditry, but good economics.

{"Headline": "Secret Deficit Lovers", "Date": "2014-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat if they balanced the budget and nobody knew or cared?So where are the ticker-tape parades? For that matter, where are the front-page news reports? After all, talk about the evils of deficits and the grave fiscal danger facing America dominated Washington for years. Shouldn\u2019t we be making a big deal of the fact that the alleged crisis is over?Well, we aren\u2019t, and once you understand why, you also understand what fiscal hysteria was really about.First, ordinary Americans aren\u2019t celebrating the deficit\u2019s decline because they don\u2019t know about it. Why doesn\u2019t the public know better? Probably because of the way much of the news media report this and other issues, with bad news played up and good news downplayed if it\u2019s reported at all. But what about people who pay a lot of attention to the budget, the self-proclaimed deficit hawks? (Some of us prefer to call them deficit scolds.) They\u2019ve spent the past few years telling us that budget shortfalls are the most important issue facing the nation, that terrible things will happen unless we act to stem the flow of red ink. Are they expressing satisfaction over the fading of that threat?All of which demonstrates a truth that has been apparent for a while, if you have been paying close attention: Deficit scolds actually love big budget deficits, and hate it when those deficits get smaller. Why? Because fears of a fiscal crisis \u2014 fears that they feed assiduously \u2014 are their best hope of getting what they really want: big cuts in social programs. A few years ago they almost managed to bully the nation into cutting Social Security and/or raising the Medicare eligibility age; they even had hopes of turning Medicare into an underfinanced voucher program. Now that window of opportunity is closing fast.So let\u2019s say goodbye to fiscal hysteria. I know that the deficit scolds are having a hard time letting go; they\u2019re still trying to bring back the days when Bowles and Simpson bestrode the Beltway like colossi. But those days aren\u2019t coming back, and we should be glad. Advertisement"}

The focus instead has been more on tethering Democratic candidates to Mr. Obama with a broad-brush condemnation of his policies.A year after it was fully in place, the Affordable Care Act has largely succeeded in delivering on President Obama\u2019s main promises, even as it fell short in some ways and gave birth to a new and powerful conservative movement.\u201cThe A.C.A. is bad policy, but it was passed because of legitimate concerns about the affordability and accessibility of health care coverage,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said in an interview. \u201cAnd we need to show we share those concerns.\u201dWithout stronger voices and a more robust policy debate, Tuesday\u2019s results are likely to leave no one to claim a mandate for a new direction if Republicans win control of the Senate.\u201cI\u2019m here raising my hand saying we\u2019ve got a health care problem in this country. I want straight talk,\u201d Mr. McFadden said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThe idea that you repeal, everything goes away and we go back to the old system? The old system is bad. We have to address it.\u201dEven though Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who could become the majority leader if he wins re-election and his party nets six seats, has stuck by his promise to repeal the law \u201croot and branch,\u201d he has conceded that is quite unlikely to happen. Still, the outcome of the election will mean, particularly if Republicans do as well as forecast, that the debate over health care is not over.For the past year, The New York Times has asked readers to share their experiences purchasing and using health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Here is a selection of their stories.But Mr. Obama would veto any attempt to repeal the law, so Republicans are left with lesser options.Under Mr. Gillespie\u2019s plan, tax credits would be used by those without access to employer-provided health care to buy insurance on the individual or small-group market. People with an existing medical condition could not be dropped or see premiums rise as long as they maintained constant coverage. Those with existing health problems who could not find health plans would go to \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d run by the states but financed with $7.5 billion in federal funds, an amount that would rise 3 percent a year.\u201cIn order to repeal Obamacare, we must present an alternative that is both practically effective and politically viable,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said when he unveiled his plan. \u201cRepeal efforts in the absence of an alternative plan have repeatedly fallen short.\u201dUnder Mr. McFadden\u2019s plan, states that have established insurance exchanges under the health care law could keep them, and some federal subsidies could be available in the form of block grants to state governments. He, too, would establish state-run high-risk pools for people with existing conditions, at a cost he estimated to be $15 billion a year, much of which would come from Washington.Unlike Mr. Gillespie, Mr. McFadden explicitly calls for maintaining the health care law\u2019s ban on lifetime coverage limits by private insurers.At this point, the argument over whether to repeal and replace the health care law or change it is \u201clargely semantic,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican member of the Center for Health Economy board who assessed Mr. Gillespie\u2019s plan. There are now at least five Republican replacement plans, and almost all of them share elements with the Affordable Care Act: tax credits to buy health insurance, protections for people with existing medical problems, a cap on the tax deductibility of employer-provided health insurance, and some definition of the kinds of health plans eligible for federal subsidies.Senior Senate Republicans are already examining how they could use a parliamentary budget rule called reconciliation to gut the health care law, by curtailing or eliminating tax credits used to purchase insurance on the law\u2019s health exchanges and repealing its tax increases. Under reconciliation, such a move could not be filibustered by Democrats, but it could be vetoed by the president.And reconciliation could not be used to alter parts of the law, such as regulations and mandates, that do not affect federal spending or revenues.\u201cIt would take 60 votes in the Senate,\u201d Mr. McConnell told Fox News. \u201cNo one thinks we\u2019re going to have 60 Republicans, and it would take a presidential signature.\u201dWith millions of Americans already covered under the law and the second open-enrollment period beginning Nov. 15, it is unclear how forceful a Republican-controlled Congress would be.If Republicans approach health care modestly and seek changes with bipartisan support, such as a repeal of the law\u2019s tax on medical devices, Democrats say they will be put in a difficult spot. If Republican leaders give their conservative voters what they want, it could enable the president\u2019s party to stage a comeback in 2016 by creating a clash over insurance coverage that Democrats think they could win.\u201cWhen I\u2019m sitting in Washington in January, that means there\u2019s something like 10, 11, 12 new Republican senators,\u201d said Mr. McFadden, who, if he wins, will have caught a very large Republican wave. \u201cI guarantee you we will believe we have a mandate to reform health care.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated one of the positions of Ed Gillespie, the Republican Senate candidate in Virginia. He is a former lobbyist, not a lobbyist.An earlier version of this article misidentified the source of a survey in which 83 percent of likely Republican voters said they wanted the health care law repealed or scaled back. It is the Harvard School of Public Health, not the Pew Research Center.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone\u2019s Drop in Inflation Carries More Fears of Another Recession", "Date": "2014-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The drop in eurozone inflation reported Tuesday was, in one sense, just a decimal point, another digit in the daily flow of depressing economic data. Yet it raised an increasingly urgent question: What will it take to arrest the Continent\u2019s slow-motion descent toward another recession and, possibly, a renewed existential crisis?Inflation is at a five-year low, leading many economists to warn that the eurozone economy is in danger of officially tipping into deflation. But even the current low level of inflation can cause consumers to delay making purchases, companies to lose revenue and unemployment to soar from already high levels.The figures came two days before the European Central Bank is scheduled to discuss monetary policy, and they are sure to increase calls for more aggressive stimulus action. But analysts are nearly unanimous that none will be coming when the central bank\u2019s governing council convenes in Naples on Thursday during one of its twice-yearly road trips outside Frankfurt.The central bank faces an array of obstacles preventing it from undertaking the same kind of broad-based asset purchases that the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have used to revive their economies.Since the financial crisis began in 2008, so-called quantitative easing has become a standard weapon in the central banking arsenal, except in the eurozone. That is true even though the central bank has consistently underestimated the severity of the decline in inflation.Mario Draghi, the central bank president, remains constrained by divisions on its governing council, the fragmented structure of the eurozone financial system, and political resistance in Germany.The central bank has offered banks four-year loans that are practically interest-free in an effort to restart lending, and it plans to begin buying private-sector assets in October. Mr. Draghi has promised to offer more details on the asset purchases on Thursday.Purchases of government bonds, an essential component of full-blown quantitative easing, remains taboo for many Germans, who regard it as a way of transferring wealth from richer countries to poorer ones. They fear that, if any countries defaulted on their debts, the central bank would pass on the losses to other member countries.\u201cThat\u2019s the big question \u2014 if the E.C.B. can deliver something substantial,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cMy theory is that they won\u2019t.\u201dTo be sure, inflation could pick up in the coming months because of the decline in the value of the euro, which on Tuesday sank below $1.26 for the first time since September 2012. A weak euro makes imported fuel and other goods more expensive for residents of the eurozone and contributes to higher inflation.Slumping energy prices were one reason for the decline in inflation in September. But there was also a decline in the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes prices for food and energy because they tend to fluctuate often. Core inflation fell to 0.7 percent from 0.9 percent, Eurostat said.The decline in that rate is potentially more worrying for the central bank because it is a more direct reflection of slack demand and the poor health of the eurozone economy.\u201cThe E.C.B. will hardly be pleased at the outlook of very low inflation rate for a longer period of time,\u201d Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients.The decline in the overall inflation rate to 0.3 percent was a preliminary estimate by Eurostat. The figure, which could be revised, was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations but still well below the bank\u2019s target of just under 2 percent.The decline in consumer prices has been greater than the central bank expected. As recently as March, central bank economists forecast that inflation this year would average 1 percent. In June, they lowered the forecast to 0.7 percent, and in September, to 0.6 percent.Gains in recent state elections by a conservative anti-euro party, the Alternative for Germany, could make the central bank even more cautious in the coming months. More aggressive monetary policy might nourish support for populist right-wing parties in Europe, which have fed on resentment toward European institutions like the bank.\u201cThe E.C.B. is ready to do everything but buy government bonds,\u201d Joachim Fels, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley, said last week during a meeting with a small group of journalists. \u201cThat shows how great the resistance is to this normal and widely used measure.\u201dTo return to meaningful growth, economists say, the eurozone probably needs a combination of measures, including more-powerful stimulus from the central bank, like government bond buying; more government spending by countries that can afford it, like Germany; and deep changes in the regulations that govern business and labor in France and Italy.The European Central Bank is preparing to buy so-called asset-backed securities, bank loans that have been bundled for resale on financial markets. It also plans to buy covered bonds, which are similar. The purchases are seen as a preliminary form of quantitative easing and a way to arrest a decline in bank lending.By selling off existing loans, banks would raise money to issue new ones. But analysts doubt that the central bank would be able to find enough asset-backed securities and covered bonds that meet its quality standards and allow it to achieve the larger goal \u2014 pumping more money into the eurozone economy.The region registered zero growth in the second quarter, threatening to interrupt a tentative decline in joblessness.Although the unemployment rate in the eurozone was unchanged at 11.5 percent, the absolute number of jobless people fell by 137,000 to 18.3 million, Eurostat said. The incremental decline suggests that unemployment will fall in the coming months but at a painfully slow pace.\u201cWe continue to expect only a modest and gradual fall in unemployment rate in the coming quarters,\u201d analysts at Barclays said in a note to clients.As in previous months, Greece and Spain had the highest unemployment rates, with 27 percent and 24.4 percent. In both countries, though, the rate has been edging slowly downward. The rate for Greece is from June, the most recent reported.Austria, with 4.7 percent, and Germany, with 4.9 percent, had the lowest unemployment rates in August.Unemployment among those under age 25 remained at 23.3 percent in the eurozone. In Greece and Spain, the jobless rate among youths remained above 50 percent, while in Italy and Croatia, it was over 40 percent.Mr. Draghi has emphasized in recent weeks that he cannot solve such economic problems alone. He has pleaded with eurozone leaders to cut taxes and red tape and to remove impediments to entrepreneurship and hiring.\u201cNo monetary \u2014 and also no fiscal \u2014 stimulus can ever have a meaningful effect without such structural reforms,\u201d he told members of the European Parliament on Sept. 22.Indeed, there is evidence that bank lending is held back not by a shortage of credit but by a dearth of creditworthy borrowers who are confident enough about the future to want to invest in new employees and in expanding their businesses.\u201cThere is no demand, because nobody is doing anything,\u201d said Stefano Micossi, director general of Assonime, an Italian business group. \u201cEverybody is waiting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dark Visions", "Date": "2014-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScience Fiction and FantasyUntil this point, Bennett\u2019s novel is an interesting but not especially riveting exploration of fallen empire and political intrigue. The city of Bulikov was once the seat of a superpower spanning the Continent, which went on to conquer the rest of the world. Bulikov\u2019s weapon was its Divinities: literal, incarnate gods who wielded phenomenal power on the Continent\u2019s behalf. When Bulikov\u2019s Divinities were killed, however, the oppressed rose against their oppressors, and now Bulikov has become a resentful colony to one of its former vassal states, Saypur. The people of the Continent suffered much in this reversal \u2014 and so, generations later, when the Saypuri master spy Shara Thivani arrives in the city to investigate a murder, she finds a hotbed of colonial politics and historico-religious echoes, all set against a memorably surreal urbanscape.That urbanscape is the best part of this essentially set-piece novel, and it\u2019s what makes the whole thing worth reading. The book is labeled epic fantasy, but there\u2019s no hint of staid European medievalism in its pages, and its root cultures are (refreshingly) secondary-world variants of czarist Russia and Mughal India. Bulikov is an ancient city trying to reinvent itself amid the ruins of its past, and it is very much a character in its own right. The city teems with leftover magic, warped and decaying from its heyday: walls that aren\u2019t quite real, endless twisting stairways to nowhere, shifting monuments to forgotten heroes. Bulikov is old, and it is mad, in multiple senses of the word. Despite its current squalor, it remembers the glory days, and wants that glory again \u2014 but old glory recreated, or new, modern glory? All of the novel\u2019s characters seek to answer this question in their own ways.The espionage and police-procedural components are the story\u2019s least interesting, which is frustrating because they make up its bulk. Thivani is another weak point. Her back story is enlivened by her lifelong friendship and rivalry with Vohannes Votrov, a dissolute Continental aristocrat, and by her more enigmatic relationship with Sigrud, the Viking-like barbarian who works, and kills, for her \u2014 but while these side characters make her more interesting by their reflected quirkiness, Thivani herself never quite leaps off the page. She is instead a cipher, evading the reader\u2019s eyes and wits as she delves into the city\u2019s deeply strange secrets.Those secrets are more than interesting enough to carry the tale all by themselves, however, so readers seeking a truly refreshing fantasy milieu should travel to Bulikov, and welcome its conquest.For anyone raised on a steady diet of dystopian Y.A. fiction, in other words, there\u2019s nothing fresh here. Yet the novel has one saving grace: It\u2019s magnificently written. Marshall evocatively captures James\u2019s confusion as he tries to reconcile his institutionalized worldview with the contradictions and grotesqueries of normal society. When he\u2019s drugged and thrown into a \u201cLord of the Flies\"-style hellhole, Marshall depicts James\u2019s dissociation and flashbacks to an earlier trauma in a powerful, blurring stream of consciousness:\u201cAnd the violins were sawing away and we were all sweating in the little church and then we were on fire, choking, clawing at each other. And there was that breath on the back of my neck: The white-haired man had found me and was going to open the back of my head. He was checking his gun. What was taking him so long?\u201dSadly, the beauty of the writing isn\u2019t quite enough to redeem a clunky plot. James meets a manic pixie dream girl who\u2019s possibly more of a sociopath than he is; he faces enemies inside and outside the Goodhouse who are virtually mustache-twirling caricatures; and no one seems to question the extremely questionable science that justifies the Goodhouse boys\u2019 imprisonment. (Girls, apparently, can\u2019t be genetically predisposed to criminality, so they aren\u2019t tested. The book is full of implausible whoppers like this.) It\u2019s probably for the best, then, that the book is aimed at an audience that might find more value in its style than its substance.Octavia\u2019s character growth is the hook for this secondary-world Victorian fantasy (only lightly flavored with steampunk, despite the \u201cclockwork\u201d in the title). Initially she\u2019s many kinds of clich\u00e9: intrepid, dangerously na\u00efve for a woman who\u2019s grown up with war and privation, more devoted to her faith than others of her order and more powerful because of it. Her competence is the first clue that she\u2019s anything more than an ing\u00e9nue in distress, but over the course of the novel, as her tragic back story is revealed and she faces stunning betrayals, she leaves the clich\u00e9s behind. Unfortunately Alonzo \u2014 her love interest, and the Clockwork Dagger of the title \u2014 is less frame-breaking. Apparently the only man of color named or noted in Caskentia, he bears an unavoidable whiff of tokenism and fetishization. Though he turns out to be an intriguing character in his own right, it\u2019s tough to get past his role as the exotic interracial romance object \u2014 a device that has become frustratingly commonplace in this kind of neo-Victorian tale.More refreshing is the world Cato weaves. Caskentia is at war with a land called the Waste, in a conflict that has lasted so long and with such atrocities on both sides that there\u2019s no clear \u201cgood guy,\u201d and no visible path to peace. There are more systems of magic at work here than just the medician\u2019s art, and many of those arts have been turned to nefarious purposes, as with any weapon in war. Octavia\u2019s horrified realization that she is such a weapon, at least in the eyes of those who would wield her, forms the emotional core of the book.There\u2019s a lot of fascinating world-building here and, despite the problems, a delightful \u00adespionage-inflected adventure.Flynne isn\u2019t an engaging enough protagonist to keep readers\u2019 attention, but the world she discovers and the events swirling around her are more than enough to make up for this. Gibson fans will be absolutely thrilled. Other readers might wish to visit some of his earlier works instead of onboarding with this one.\u201cAncillary Justice,\u201d the first novel in Ann Leckie\u2019s far-future posthuman space opera series, recently became the first novel to win the \u201ctriple crown\u201d of the genre (the Hugo, Nebula and Arthur C. Clarke awards), but not without controversy. The central question is whether the story\u2019s structural gimmick \u2014 the protagonist\u2019s tendency to refer to all people as \u201cshe\u201d regardless of actual gender or even humanity \u2014 is sufficiently mind-blowing as to merit all the accolades. It isn\u2019t a gimmick, though; it\u2019s a coup. Rather than seriously entertain the endless, if stupid, debate on whether women have a place in stories of the future, Leckie\u2019s book does the literary equivalent of rolling its eyes and walking out of the room. Her refusal to waste energy on stupidity forces her audience to do the same: A few pages into the first novel, the reader gives up trying to guess each character\u2019s actual gender, and just accepts that this will be a story full of interesting women doing awesome things.This is the most powerful element of the story. Where the first novel explored the consequences of a human transcending individuality (namely Anaander Mianaai, whose thousands of minds have split and brought the Radchaai to civil war), here we see the consequences of a many-minded entity being reduced to simple humanity. Throughout the novel, even as she struggles to unify her crew and the Athoeki, Breq shows the strain of her tremendous loss. In the process, Leckie thumbs her nose again at science fiction tradition, which abounds with disabled people being made whole by technology, and with nonhumans inexplicably yearning for humanity. The technology of the Radchaai is miraculous, but it cannot repair identity. And why would any entity with a truly nonhuman identity ever crave humanity? Where Leckie poked holes in sexist thought in the last book, here she attacks the self-absorption of science fiction itself. After all, is the genre truly meant to explore new ways of thinking? Or should it just endlessly stroke the egos of its assumed audience? Leckie once again makes it delightfully clear that one of these questions is just too stupid to be worth her time.N. K.

{"Headline": "What China Means by \u2018Rule of Law\u2019", "Date": "2014-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW HAVEN \u2014 Two weeks ago, with the democracy protests in Hong Kong in full swing, China\u2019s official People\u2019s Daily newspaper labeled them \u201cillegal\u201d and called for protecting \u201cthe rule of law\u201d in Hong Kong. Such statements left observers with little doubt about a central meaning \u201cthe rule of law\u201d has in the People\u2019s Republic: the Communist Party\u2019s use of law to control and regulate society.Yet there\u2019s plenty of evidence that China sees the rule of law in far more nuanced and complex ways. Today the Communist Party\u2019s 18th Central Committee starts its Fourth Plenum, and the main topic will be the rule of law in China \u2014 the first time in party history that a meeting with the authority of a plenary session will focus on the rule of law. And there are reasons for a measure of optimism that the plenum will demonstrate more complex views about the roles law can play and also take meaningful steps to advance new legal reforms.Of course, legal reform has major limits in China\u2019s one-party authoritarian system. There won\u2019t be true judicial independence. All bets are off whenever the party sees a threat to its continued power; steps toward the rule of law don\u2019t mean steps toward multiparty political democracy, which China\u2019s current leaders totally resist. When the plenum issues its report, it will surely underscore that one central role of law is to maintain social order.But, contrary to what pessimistic observers have predicted, the plenum is not likely to treat law as merely a tool for the party to control Chinese society, a throwback to the \u201cLegalist School\u201d of philosophy from 2,200 years ago which President Xi Jinping seems fond of quoting. Chinese society and its legal system have already changed too fundamentally for that, and the current regime led by Mr. Xi has already signed onto many reforms and even adjustments in ideology that represent positive steps toward a modern system of rule of law. These changes aren\u2019t just window-dressing; they reflect the leadership\u2019s recognition that it needs to improve governance, address widespread public grievances, and respond to public opinion.Consider some legal reforms that have been made in just the last few years. Use of the death penalty has been cut roughly in half, with improved procedures for deciding on its use. A new Criminal Procedure Law has been adopted, providing significantly more protections to suspects and defendants. The odious system of \u201cre-education through labor\u201d has been abolished (though, to be sure, what will replace it is still not clear).A sea change has taken place in government transparency, with important requirements of open government information changing the relationship between the state and citizens. Zhou Qiang, the strong new president of the Supreme People\u2019s Court, recently issued a five-year judicial reform plan promising to enhance court independence from interfering local governments, increase judicial openness and transparency, improve fairness to individual litigants, and further professionalize judging.Some critics point to recent official statements demonizing \u201cconstitutionalism\u201d and ask how can China be serious about legal reform if it denigrates or sidelines its own Constitution. In fact, \u201cconstitutionalism\u201d has become a code word for a specific idea: importing Western political democracy, which China\u2019s leaders will not accept. But as for the Constitution itself, Mr. Xi recently called it China\u2019s \u201cfundamental law\u201d and said that to \u201cgovern the nation by law means to govern in accordance with the Constitution.\u201d China currently has no effective mechanism for enforcing its Constitution \u2014 a major deficiency \u2014 but at least that crucial topic is now being openly discussed.China\u2019s leaders see improving the legal system not simply as a way to control society but as a way to rein in wayward bureaucrats, insist that local officials carry out national policies, establish rules of the road for a more robust economy, provide peaceful ways for citizens to resolve disputes and seek redress for grievances, reduce the corruption that\u2019s seen as the greatest threat to the Party\u2019s continued hold on power \u2014 in short, to constrain government itself, not just to control society and contain social unrest. Mr. Xi may have been playing to the crowds when he recently spoke of \u201clocking power in a cage,\u201d but it was a recognition that the party needs to constrain some of its power in order to keep it.Moreover, China\u2019s maturing legal community, as well as ordinary Chinese citizens, follow these developments carefully, so expectations have been raised. Failure to deliver and actually enforce reforms would create a destabilizing pushback on China\u2019s leaders. The most convincing reason for outsiders to be cautiously optimistic about these developments is that many legal figures within China, like the revered legal scholar and reformer Jiang Ping, have written about the plenum with cautious optimism.This is not to say that China is about to abandon its preoccupation with \u201csocial stability,\u201d which too often means silencing or imprisoning peaceful dissenters and activists who blow the whistle on some of the country\u2019s many woes, including environmental degradation, abuses of power and needless policies against Tibetans and Uighurs.. But in the eyes of China\u2019s leaders, social stability is what enabled China to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in a mere few decades, generate huge economic growth, and peacefully re-establish China as a major power among nations. The prospects for legal reform will be greatly enhanced if China\u2019s leaders come to see how the rule of law itself contributes to social stability.Above all, we should recognize that every reform made or promised in China, even in a regime that contains factions opposed to reform, provides an opening for a large group of scholars, activists, reform-minded officials, as well as ordinary citizens to push to implement the changes and to find new openings for reform. The constraints are real, but so are the dynamics for producing ongoing reforms. Advertisement"}

Telecom Companies Look for Room to Grow", "Date": "2014-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust weeks before the new European Commission starts work, the lobbying efforts from the region\u2019s telecommunications operators are already hard at work.On Wednesday, senior executives of many of Europe\u2019s largest telecoms, including Orange of France and Deutsche Telekom of Germany, called on local regulators to cut back on red tape and allow consolidation within the sector as a way to jump-start Europe\u2019s economy.\u201cWe desperately want growth in Europe,\u201d said Dominique Leroy, head of the former Belgian monopoly Belgacom, at an industry conference in Brussels on Wednesday. \u201cIndustry players are willing to invest billions of euros. But we can\u2019t do it because we can\u2019t monetize our investments.\u201dThe push to persuade the new European Commission, which takes over as the European Union\u2019s new executive arm on Nov. 1, to cut back on regulation follows a lengthy stand-off between consumer groups and industry trade bodies over how to promote investment in Europe\u2019s telecommunications sector.Unlike in the United States, where national carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless now dominate, Europe has more than 100 telecommunications operators that often compete within national borders.Consumer groups and some national regulators assert that this domestic competition has kept prices low and given Europeans greater choice. The average European pays $38 for a monthly cellphone contract, or roughly half of what the typical American pays, according to GSMA, an industry group.But telecommunications executives say the cutthroat national competition among carriers has limited the investment that companies can make to upgrade their networks. Tough antitrust regulations have limited the ability of companies to buy competitors in other areas of Europe to create pan-regional mobile and broadband networks, according to analysts.\u201cThere\u2019s a very different way of approaching competition in the U.S. compared to Europe,\u201d David Bailey, global head of telecommunications, media and technology at HSBC, said at the conference in Brussels. \u201cCompetition, however irrational from a corporate perspective, is seen as something that will continue forever in Europe.\u201dAs part of efforts to lift investment, the new European Commission is expected to finish new rules as soon as early next year to create a single European market for electronic communications \u2014 called the \u201cConnected Continent\u201d proposals.The long-awaited changes could potentially increase consolidation in Europe\u2019s telecom sector. It may also create a central E.U. regulator; each of Europe\u2019s 28-member states now regulate the sector.A new round of consolidation also has started to take shape. The likes of Telef\u00f3nica of Spain and Vodafone of Britain have spent billions of euros recently to acquire mobile carriers and cable providers from Germany to Spain to strengthten their pan-regional networks.Europe\u2019s telecommunications operators also got a helping hand on Wednesday from Lowell C. McAdam, chief executive of Verizon Communications, who said at the Brussels conference that the creation of one set of American rules had helped the country\u2019s carriers invest billions in mobile and cable infrastructure.\u201cThe digital economy isn\u2019t limited by geographical borders,\u201d Mr. McAdam said. \u201cRegulation must protect consumers and enable investment, while avoiding regulation that tries to outsmart the dynamic ecosystem.\u201dYet while Europe\u2019s telecom executives are unified in their goal to reduce the region\u2019s strict rules on market consolidation and investment, the same cannot be said about their approach to Internet companies like Google and Facebook.Pierre Louette, deputy chief executive at Orange, the French carrier, on Wednesday took a swipe at these American companies, which have faced fewer regulations and greater freedoms to expand across Europe compared to traditional carriers.\u201cWe always pay taxes in Europe,\u201d said Mr. Louette, in a jibe at the likes of Google, which have used complicated tax structures to reduce their tax global burdens. \u201cWe can\u2019t be put together in the same categories. We can\u2019t continue to be over-regulated, while they are not regulated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Problem With Energy Efficiency", "Date": "2014-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 ON Tuesday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics to three researchers whose work contributed to the development of a radically more efficient form of lighting known as light-emitting diodes, or LEDs.In announcing the award, the academy said, \u201cReplacing light bulbs and fluorescent tubes with LEDs will lead to a drastic reduction of electricity requirements for lighting.\u201d The president of the Institute of Physics noted: \u201cWith 20 percent of the world\u2019s electricity used for lighting, it\u2019s been calculated that optimal use of LED lighting could reduce this to 4 percent.\u201dThe winners, Shuji Nakamura, an American, and Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano, both from Japan, justly deserve their Nobel, and should be commended for creating a technology that produces the same amount of light with less energy.But it would be a mistake to assume that LEDs will significantly reduce overall energy consumption.LED\u2019s are but the latest breakthrough in lighting efficiency. Consider the series of accelerated lighting revolutions ushered in by the Industrial Revolution. In the early and mid-1800s, for instance, \u201ctown gas\u201d made from coal was developed and used to illuminate streetlights. Whale oil became the preferred indoor lighting fuel for upper-income Americans until it was replaced by more efficient kerosene lamps. And then, finally, in the late 19th century, the electric light bulb emerged.Along the way, demand would rise for these new technologies and increase as new ways were found to use them. This led to more overall energy consumption.From outer space, you can see the results of this long progression of illumination. More and more of the planet is dotted with clusters of lights.There is no reason to think that the trend lines for demand for LED lighting will be any different, especially as incomes rise and the desire for this cheaper technology takes hold in huge, emerging economies like China, India and Nigeria, where the sheer volume of the demand will be likely to trump the efficiency gains.Energy-efficient lighting has been, without question, a boon for economic development. Over the past two centuries, the real cost of illumination in Britain has declined by a factor of 3,000, largely because of efficiency improvements, according to the researchers Roger Fouquet of the London School of Economics and Peter J. G. Pearson of Imperial College, London. This cheap lighting technology is used today not just to light our streets, workplaces and homes but for televisions, computers and cellphones.These productivity improvements are a primary driver of long-term economic growth. Especially in developing economies, cheap, energy-efficient lighting will almost certainly allow poor people to bring modern lighting into their homes much faster than they otherwise would. And that will almost certainly result in faster growth in energy demand globally.The growing evidence that low-cost efficiency often leads to faster energy growth was recently considered by both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency. They concluded that energy savings associated with new, more energy efficient technologies were likely to result in significant \u201crebounds,\u201d or increases, in energy consumption. This means that very significant percentages of energy savings will be lost to increased energy consumption.That\u2019s not a bad thing. Most people in the world, still struggling to achieve modern living standards, need to consume more energy, not less. Cheap LED and other more efficient energy technologies will be overwhelmingly positive for people and economies all over the world.But LED and other ultraefficient lighting technologies are unlikely to reduce global energy consumption or reduce carbon emissions. If we are to make a serious dent in carbon emissions, there is no escaping the need to shift to cleaner sources of energy.An opinion article on Oct. 9 about LED lighting incorrectly described an estimate that over 50 percent of the global energy reductions made possible by new, more efficient technologies could be negated by a corresponding rise in energy consumption. Estimates of that magnitude have been cited in reports by the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but have not been endorsed by either entity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil Stays With Rousseff as President After Turbulent Campaign", "Date": "2014-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazilian voters re-elected Dilma Rousseff as president on Sunday, endorsing a leftist leader who has achieved important gains in reducing poverty and keeping unemployment low over a centrist challenger who castigated her government for a simmering bribery scandal and a sluggish economy. Ms. Rousseff of the Workers Party took 51.4 percent of the vote in the second and final round of elections, against 48.5 percent for A\u00e9cio Neves, a senator from the Social Democracy party and scion of a political family from the state of Minas Gerais, electoral officials said Sunday night with 98 percent of votes in the country counted. While Ms. Rousseff won by a thin margin, the tumultuous race was marked by accusations of corruption, personal insults and heated debates, revealing climbing polarization in Brazil. Mr. Neves surged into the lead this month in opinion surveys, only to be eclipsed by Ms. Rousseff as the vote on Sunday approached. \u201cPeople without much money have seen their lives improve during recent years,\u201d said Liane Lima, 62, a secretary in S\u00e3o Paulo who voted for Ms. Rousseff. \u201cI think we should let Dilma finish what she started.\u201d Indeed, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s victory reflects broad changes in Brazilian society since the Workers Party rose to power 12 years ago with the election of her predecessor and mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who chose Ms. Rousseff as his successor to run in the 2010 election and campaigned for her again this year. Building on an economic stabilization project put in place by the Social Democrats in the 1990s, Ms. Rousseff and Mr. da Silva aggressively expanded social welfare programs, lifting millions of Brazilians out of poverty. Pointing to the popularity of the antipoverty spending, Mr. Neves, the challenger in the race, said he would not scale it back. In addition to facing turbulence in the markets, Ms. Rousseff will deal in her next four-year term with a sprawling scandal involving testimony of bribes and money laundering at Petrobras, the national oil company, which has eroded confidence in the Workers Party. A former high-ranking executive at Petrobras has testified that he channeled bribes to the party and its allies in Bras\u00edlia.\u201cI always voted for the Workers Party, since I was a teenager, but this government hasn\u2019t done anything different,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Abel, 48, who runs a tourist agency in Bras\u00edlia and voted for Mr. Neves largely out of concern over corruption in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government. \u201cThey\u2019re just the same as other parties now.\u201d Still, with the unemployment rate remaining near historical lows even during a recession, economic stability seemed to trump corruption as a major issue among voters. Many people who cast ballots on Sunday expressed concern that a change in government could erode welfare benefits which are now a fixture of society. \u201cMy life is stable thanks to Dilma\u2019s government,\u201d said Diogo Bernardo, 28, an installer of telephone lines in Rio de Janeiro who voted for Ms. Rousseff, referring to her by her first name, as is common in Brazil. \u201cShe\u2019s not great, but A\u00e9cio would have been worse since he cares less about the rights of working people. I voted for the lesser of two evils.\u201d Mr. Neves, in a televised speech conceding defeat, said that he had spoken with Ms. Rousseff and congratulated her. \u201cThe largest of all priorities now is to unite Brazil,\u201d he said. In her victory speech, Ms. Rousseff also called for reconciliation. \u201cThis president here is open to dialogue,\u201d she said.The thin margin of victory for the Workers Party revealed rifts in the country, with Ms. Rousseff winning easily in the relatively poor northeast while Mr. Neves comfortably won in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s richest and most populous state. Ms. Rousseff also won in Minas Gerais, Brazil\u2019s second most populous state, where Mr. Neves was recently the governor.With Ms. Rousseff set to govern for another term, the leftist Workers Party, which was created in 1980 in opposition to the military dictatorship ruling Brazil, is also poised to be in power for 16 years. Moreover, the party\u2019s leaders have already said that they want Mr. da Silva, who served as president from 2003 to 2010, to run again in 2018.While many Brazilians are clearly content with giving Ms. Rousseff another term, others are not so sanguine about one party being in power for so long.Juliana Ribeiro Lima, an artist in S\u00e3o Paulo, said Sunday night after the results were announced that she was concerned about the possibility that the Workers Party could deepen its control of public institutions, as other political movements have done in Argentina and Venezuela.\u201cThis creates doubts for me about staying in Brazil,\u201d said Ms. Ribeiro Lima, 42. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way now to go abroad.\u201dCl\u00f3vis Rossi, a columnist for the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, pointed out that Ms. Rousseff faced two options after her win. \u201cDilma can more or less think like this: I won the election with the country in a technical recession and inflation above the targets, so I\u2019m going to continue down the same path and to hell with the critics,\u201d he wrote on Sunday night.He continued, \u201cOr she can take note of strong opposition vote, and change her course.\u201d Lucy Jordan contributed reported from Bras\u00edlia, Mariana Sim\u00f5es from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Ramon from S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Brutal Process", "Date": "2014-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.For residents of the world\u2019s pre-\u00ademinent capitalist nation, American historians have produced remarkably few studies of capitalism in the United States. This situation was exacerbated in the 1970s, when economic history began to migrate from history to economics departments, where it too often became an exercise in scouring the past for numerical data to plug into computerized models of the economy. Recently, however, the history of American capitalism has emerged as a thriving cottage industry. This new work portrays capitalism not as a given (something that \u201ccame in the first ships,\u201d as the historian Carl Degler once wrote) but as a system that developed over time, has been constantly evolving and penetrates all aspects of society.Slavery plays a crucial role in this literature. For decades, historians depicted the institution as unprofitable and on its way to extinction before the Civil War (a conflict that was therefore unnecessary). Recently, historians like Sven Beckert, Robin Blackburn and Walter Johnson have emphasized that cotton, the raw material of the early Industrial Revolution, was by far the most important commodity in 19th-century international trade and that capital accumulated through slave labor flowed into the coffers of Northern and British bankers, merchants and manufacturers. And far from being economically backward, slave owners pioneered advances in modern accounting and finance.Edward E. Baptist situates \u201cThe Half Has Never Been Told\u201d squarely within this context. Baptist, who teaches at Cornell University, is the author of a well-\u00adregarded study of slavery in Florida. Now he expands his purview to the entire cotton kingdom, the heartland of 19th-\u00adcentury American slavery. (Unfortunately, slavery in the Upper South, where cotton was not an economic staple, is barely discussed, even though as late as 1860 more slaves lived in Virginia than any other state.) In keeping with the approach of the new historians of capitalism, the book covers a great deal of ground \u2014 not only economic enterprise but religion, ideas of masculinity and gender, and national and Southern politics. Baptist\u2019s work is a valuable addition to the growing literature on slavery and American development. Where Baptist breaks new ground is in his emphasis on the centrality of the interstate trade in slaves to the regional and national economies and his treatment of the role of extreme violence in the workings of the slave system. After the legal importation of slaves from outside the country ended in 1808, the spread of slavery into the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico would not have been possible without the enormous uprooting of people from Maryland and Virginia. Almost one million slaves, Baptist estimates, were transported to the cotton fields from the Upper South in the decades before the Civil War. The domestic slave trade was highly organized and economically efficient, relying on such modern technologies as the steamboat, railroad and telegraph. For African-Americans, its results were devastating. Since buyers preferred young workers \u201cwith no attachments,\u201d the separation of husbands from wives and parents from children was intrinsic to its operation, not, as many historians have claimed, a regrettable side effect. Baptist shows how slaves struggled to recreate a sense of community in the face of this disaster.The sellers of slaves, Baptist insists, were not generally paternalistic owners who fell on hard times and parted reluctantly with members of their metaphorical plantation \u201cfamilies,\u201d but entrepreneurs who knew an opportunity for gain when they saw one. As for the slave traders \u2014 the middlemen \u2014 they excelled at maximizing profits. They not only emphasized the labor abilities of those for sale (reinforced by humiliating public inspections of their bodies), but appealed to buyers\u2019 salacious fantasies. In the 1830s, the term \u201cfancy girl\u201d began to appear in slave-trade notices to describe young women who fetched high prices because of their physical attractiveness. \u201cSlavery\u2019s frontier,\u201d Baptist writes, \u201cwas a white man\u2019s sexual playground.\u201dThe cotton kingdom that arose in the Deep South was incredibly brutal. Violence against Native Americans who originally owned the land, competing imperial powers like Spain and Britain and slave rebels solidified American control of the Gulf states. Violence, Baptist contends, explains the remarkable increase of labor productivity on cotton plantations. Without any technological innovations in cotton picking, output per hand rose dramatically between 1800 and 1860. Some economic historians have attributed this to incentives like money payments for good work and the opportunity to rise to skilled positions. Baptist rejects this explanation.Planters called their method of labor control the \u201cpushing system.\u201d Each slave was assigned a daily picking quota, which increased steadily over time. Baptist, who feels that historians too often employ circumlocutions that obscure the horrors of slavery, prefers to call it \u201cthe \u2018whipping-machine\u2019 system.\u201d In fact, the word we should really use, he insists, is \u201ctorture.\u201d To make slaves work harder and harder, planters utilized not only incessant beating but forms of discipline familiar in our own time \u2014 sexual humiliation, bodily mutilation, even waterboarding. In the cotton kingdom, \u201cwhite people inflicted torture far more often than in almost any human society that ever existed.\u201d When Abraham Lincoln reminded Americans in his Second Inaugural Address of the 250 years of \u201cblood drawn with the lash\u201d that preceded the Civil War, he was making a similar point: Violence did not begin in the United States with the firing on Fort Sumter.Baptist has a knack for explaining complex financial matters in lucid prose. He relates how in the 1830s Southern banks developed new financial instruments, bonds with slaves as collateral, that enabled planters to borrow enormous amounts of money to acquire new land, and how lawmakers backed these bonds with the state\u2019s credit. A speculative bubble ensued, and when it collapsed, taxpayers were left to foot the bill. But rather than bailing out Northern and European bondholders, several states simply defaulted on their debts. Many planters fled with their slaves to Texas, until 1845 an independent republic, to avoid creditors. \u201cHonor,\u201d a key element in Southern notions of masculinity, went only so far.By the 1850s, prosperity returned to the cotton economy, and planters had no difficulty obtaining loans in financial markets. As the railroad opened new areas to cultivation and cotton output soared, slave owners saw themselves as a modern, successful part of the world capitalist economy. They claimed the right to bring their slaves into all the nation\u2019s territories, and indeed into free states. These demands aroused intense opposition in the North, leading to Lincoln\u2019s election, secession and civil war. Baptist clearly hopes his findings will reach a readership beyond academe \u2014 a worthy ambition. He pursues this goal, however, in ways that sometimes undermine the book\u2019s coherence. The chapter titles, which refer to parts of the body, often have little connection to the content that follows. Presumably to avoid sounding academic, he sprinkles the text with anachronistic colloquialisms (\u201cthe president was all in\u201d is how he describes Franklin Pierce\u2019s embrace of the Kansas-Nebraska bill in 1854) and with telegraphic sentences more appropriate for Twitter. Occasionally, he deploys four-letter words that cannot be reproduced in these pages. This is unnecessary \u2014 his story does not require additional shock value.It is hardly a secret that slavery is deeply embedded in our nation\u2019s history. But many Americans still see it as essentially a footnote, an exception to a dominant narrative of the expansion of liberty on this continent. If the various elements of \u201cThe Half Has Never Been Told\u201d are not entirely pulled together, its underlying argument is persuasive: Slavery was essential to American development and, indeed, to the violent construction of the capitalist world in which we live.

{"Headline": "Federal Housing Finance Agency Unveils Plan to Loosen Rules on Mortgages ", "Date": "2014-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, politicians, housing advocates and potential home buyers have complained that tight credit policies after the housing market crash have kept too many deserving people from qualifying for mortgages.Now the government is taking steps that it says it hopes will allow more first-time buyers and lower- and middle-income Americans to get home loans at low rates.On Monday, Melvin L. Watt, the nation\u2019s chief housing regulator, announced a program offering more reassurances to mortgage banks that fear they could suffer unpredictable losses on the loans they sell to the government.Separately, he disclosed that efforts are underway to allow borrowers to receive government-backed loans with much smaller down payments than are now required. But contrary to early expectations, he offered few details on such plans.\u201cWe know that access to credit remains tight for many borrowers, and we are also working to address this issue in a responsible and thoughtful manner,\u201d said Mr. Watt, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The move in large part is intended to reassure banks that have had to pay tens of billions of dollars to settle legal cases arising from the housing boom and bust and buy back bad loans sold to Fannie and Freddie. To avoid having to make those payments again, many lenders now demand that borrowers meet stricter requirements for loans, known in the industry as overlays.Some economists, with mortgage bankers, welcomed the new plan, saying that it, with more gains in the job market and a recent dip in mortgage rates, could put the housing recovery back on track. Ben S. Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, recently told an audience that even he could not get a loan to refinance his mortgage.\u201cCreditworthy borrowers who have been locked out of the housing market will finally have an opportunity to become homeowners,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.But some housing finance analysts contend that tight credit does not sufficiently explain the weakness in the housing market. Instead, they say, an aging population, stagnant wages and a wariness of taking on new debt have all reduced demand for mortgages.\u201cThe reality is that this is as much a demand-driven drought as it is a credit-driven drought,\u201d said Joshua Rosner, of Graham Fisher & Company, a research firm.With the new plan, the government is trying to strike a balance between the frenzied years of the housing bubble, when mortgages were approved with little regard for the ability of borrowers to repay them, and the tight grip on mortgages after it burst.\u201cIt requires a lot of fine-tuning to get a national mortgage market that achieves all the objectives we want,\u201d said Stan Humphries, chief economist for Zillow, a real estate website.To reassure mortgage lenders, the housing finance agency intends to further relax the agreements that determine when Fannie and Freddie may require banks to buy back bad loans. The terms that are being loosened involve loans that show evidence of fraud or other flaws in the underwriting process.Under the new agreements, for instance, Fannie and Freddie would demand buybacks only when there was a pattern of misrepresentations and inaccuracies in the loans. In addition, if problems are later discovered in loans, the deficiencies would have to be significant enough to have made the loans ineligible for purchase by Fannie and Freddie in the first place.These changes follow other recent adjustments by the housing finance agency to calm mortgage lenders. But mortgage banks did not increase lending to less creditworthy borrowers.Now, some housing specialists are more hopeful that the overhaul announced on Monday will prompt the banks to lend more. \u201cIt will be helpful in moving the needle,\u201d Jim Parrott, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said.Mr. Watt said he would give specifics in a few weeks about a plan for borrowers that could include down payments of as little as 3 percent.Borrowers can already apply for low down-payment loans that are backed by the Federal Housing Administration. But housing specialists said that some borrowers who qualified for loans backed by Fannie and Freddie were being directed to the F.H.A., which backs loans that have much higher interest rates.\u201cYou want people to get the loan they qualify for,\u201d said Michael D. Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending.Advertisement"}

He wants to refinance his mortgage, but the bank won\u2019t give him a loan.It is perhaps not the most shocking story in the world, but it becomes so when you learn that the think tank employee is Ben S. Bernanke, who was until earlier this year the chairman of the Federal Reserve, charged with setting the course of interest rate policy for the United States economy.So what\u2019s going on?The problem probably boils down to this: Anybody who knows how the world works may know that Ben Bernanke has vast earning potential, and that he is as safe a credit risk as one could imagine. But he just changed jobs a few months ago. And in the thoroughly automated world of mortgage finance, having recently changed jobs makes you a steeper credit risk.That would seem to fit Mr. Bernanke to a tee. He recently ended 11 years of steady employment with the federal government, during which he earned a steady salary. Now, while his earning potential is vast, it is irregular, with an unpredictable stream of revenue from speeches and book advance payments.At the event in Chicago, Mr. Bernanke was using his own refinancing difficulties to make a point that mortgage credit may still be tighter than it should be. But rather than a simple matter of tight versus loose, the real dynamic in the mortgage market right now may be one of a lack of flexibility.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage companies, now dominate the market for loans, so banks must meet their strict standards for any loans they wish to sell off to them at favorable interest rates. And banks themselves are under pressure from regulators not to take major risks on their balance sheets.More broadly, the old-school model of what it means to apply for a mortgage \u2014 go down to your local bank and have a loan officer meet with you and try to judge whether you are likely to repay the mortgage \u2014 is very much a thing of the past.The more automated mortgages have become \u2014 based on formulas tied to credit scores and employment histories \u2014 the less room individual lenders have to use sensible judgment to conclude that, just maybe, the nice man with a beard who looks vaguely familiar and seems quite certain he will make plenty of money to make his mortgage payments might be a good credit risk, no matter what his employment status says.

In the deal that allowed Mr. Abadi to take office, Mr. Maliki was given the largely ceremonial post of vice president. But according to politicians in and outside their party, Dawa, and their bloc, State of Law, Mr. Maliki has not gone quietly.During a closed-door meeting of State of Law last month, Mr. Maliki, its leader, seemed intent on humiliating Mr. Abadi, several participants said, granting him only several minutes to address the assembled politicians and frequently interrupting him.During one interruption, Mr. Maliki suggested that Mr. Abadi did not have a firm grasp on which foreign forces were operating in Iraq and questioned his protection of the country\u2019s sovereignty, participants recalled. Mr. Abadi said that the country\u2019s sovereignty was ceded in June, under Mr. Maliki\u2019s watch, when Mosul fell to Islamic State fighters. Mr. Maliki has also refused to give up his prime ministerial offices, in one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s former palaces in the Green Zone, several politicians said.Neither Mr. Abadi nor Mr. Maliki responded to requests for interviews.Supporters of Mr. Maliki have enjoyed drawing a contrast between the personalities of the two men, asserting that Mr. Abadi lacks Mr. Maliki\u2019s decisiveness, resolve and charisma \u2014 necessary qualities, they say, to lead a country as tumultuous as Iraq.\u201cAbadi has a weak personality, not a strong personality,\u201d said Hanan Fatlawi, a Shiite parliamentarian and member of the State of Law bloc, who is close to Mr. Maliki. \u201cHe has no courage to decide about important things.\u201dShe added, \u201cHe is really in a lot of trouble.\u201dMr. Abadi\u2019s critics also point to several early missteps, including his failure to win approval, even within his own bloc, for his nominees for defense and interior ministers. Weeks later, the positions still remain unfilled in the middle of war.\u201cWhen he brought the candidates and he was crushed, he was really downgraded,\u201d said one Shiite parliamentarian critical of Mr. Abadi. Like several others interviewed, he requested anonymity so as not to be seen publicly criticizing the prime minister.Mr. Abadi\u2019s detractors, the politician said, \u201creally want to give him a bloody nose.\u201dSome of Mr. Abadi\u2019s Shiite critics seem particularly frustrated by his approach toward Sunnis and Kurds, saying that in seeking to adopt a more conciliatory and less sectarian posture than his predecessor, he risked forsaking his Shiite brethren.Mr. Abadi\u2019s supporters, however, and even some of his critics, commend him for having an open mind and for listening to a broad range of viewpoints.\u201cLook at the country, at what has happened to Iraq over the last few years!\u201d exclaimed one Shiite parliamentarian and supporter of Mr. Abadi who requested anonymity so as not to damage fragile political alliances. \u201cPrime Minister Abadi wants to unify the country and change the previous policy of divisiveness.\u201dMr. Abadi\u2019s early gestures of reconciliation have pleased many Sunni leaders, who had grown disenchanted with Mr. Maliki\u2019s highly sectarian approach.In interviews, several Sunni leaders offered guarded praise of Mr. Abadi\u2019s early moves, including his decision to block attempts to nominate as interior minister Hadi al-Ameri, the head of the Badr Organization militia, which is loathed by many Sunnis.They also commend him for his promise to release thousands of prisoners, mostly Sunnis, being held without charges; for his decision to stop the shelling of urban areas where Islamic State fighters were operating, a practice that resulted in many civilian deaths; and for retiring underperforming generals who Mr. Malaki had protected.\u201cAbadi realized the dangers of continuing Maliki\u2019s path,\u201d said Mithal al-Alusi, a Sunni member of parliament. \u201cI think he\u2019s trusting people outside his party. I think this requires a more supportive environment.\u201d\u201cThe first deeds are very clear,\u201d added Maysoon al-Damluji, another Sunni parliamentarian. \u201cBut still there\u2019s a lot of road to cover.\u201dBahaa al-Aaraji, a deputy prime minister of Iraq and a Shiite, said in an interview that he hoped the discord within the Shiite bloc could be put to rest. Getting Mr. Malaki and Mr. Abadi to engage in constructive, face-to-face dialogue was crucial.\u201cThey don\u2019t talk, they don\u2019t meet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe succeed when all the parties are sitting at the same table.\u201dThen, using Arabic shorthand for the Islamic State, he added, \u201cWe can\u2019t succeed against Daesh if we can\u2019t sort out the problems among us.\u201dOmar al-Jawoshy and Falih Hassan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "4 Decades of Inhaling Deeply: A History of \u2018High Times\u2019", "Date": "2014-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The Times9 PhotosIn college dorm rooms in the 1970s and \u201980s, High Times magazine was famous for the same reason Playboy was: its centerfolds.Where Playboy delivered brazenly exposed totalities, the centerfolds in High Times depicted feats of horticulture: close-up photographs of plump marijuana plants and glistening buds. Hang a High Times centerfold on your wall, acquire a few Grateful Dead concert tapes, tie-dye a T-shirt and you could plausibly reinvent yourself as a hippie.High Times turns 40 this year, and with marijuana laws loosening in America, it\u2019s easy to forget how radical an outrider of the counterculture this magazine was. Its editors were (and are) brave, subversive and funny. They\u2019ve tended to take nothing seriously except for one crucial thing: the way so many lives have been destroyed by an inept and misguided war on drugs.To celebrate the magazine\u2019s anniversary, we have \u201cHigh Times: A 40-Year History of the World\u2019s Most Infamous Magazine,\u201d a coffee table book for low, sticky coffee tables. It\u2019s a lot of fun, this volume, packed with toasted social history and stoner wit. But it also bangs home, again and again, a righteous moral point.It\u2019s a point that Michael Kennedy, the magazine\u2019s longtime general counsel, puts this way in his introduction: \u201cAt High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees, and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlessly.\u201d Fun fact: Mr. Chong has appeared on the magazine\u2019s cover eight times, more than any other human. After starting High Times, Mr. For\u00e7ade ran the Underground Press Syndicate, later called the Alternative Press Syndicate. He was also a fairly serious pot smuggler, according to Dan Skye, a longtime High Times editor Mr. For\u00e7ade\u2019s sideline may explain his magazine\u2019s early focus on news you can use, trafficking division. High Times headlines included \u201cBest Smuggling Ships,\u201d \u201cA Consumer\u2019s Guide to Scales\u201d and (my favorite) \u201cHow to Fly Low.\u201d Mr. For\u00e7ade committed suicide in New York in 1978, when he was just 33. By this time, though, High Times was an obvious success. Circulation numbers are hard to come by, but Mr. Skye cites an article saying that in 1978, the magazine had four million readers a month. The celebrities on its covers in the 1970s included Bob Marley, and Truman Capote grinning next to Andy Warhol. Gregg Allman and Cher made a more ignominious appearance on a 1978 cover as \u201cinformer couple of the year.\u201d The essays and journalism in High Times were not mere bong water. William S. Burroughs, Charles Bukowski and Tom Robbins wrote regularly for the magazine. You flip through the covers reprinted here (this book has more images than text) and see headlines like \u201cAldous Huxley on Moksha Yag\u00e9\u201d and \u201cPaul Bowles on Kif.\u201d There were interviews with Susan Sontag and Noam Chomsky. High Times brought an entire underground economy (pipes, rolling papers, elaborate bongs, Pocahontas headbands) out of the closet. If this book has a narrative arc, it\u2019s in watching the editorial focus switch from garish travel stories (\u201cSecret Hash-Making in Mexico\u201d) to a cheerful Home Depot-like do-it-yourself ethos.During the 1980s, a High Times editor named Danny Danko writes, the word \u201chomegrown\u201d went from \u201ca term of derision to one of praise.\u201d You began to see headlines like \u201cLight Intensity: How Much Is Enough?\u201d and \u201cHow to Grow 10-Pound Monster Plants.\u201dThere were dark times. In 1989, the Drug Enforcement Administration raided the shops of many retailers that advertised in the magazine and seized customer lists. In 2004, High Times briefly (and disastrously) tried to drop marijuana coverage and become a literary magazine, under a new publisher and editors who included John Buffalo Mailer, Norman Mailer\u2019s son. After a few months of this dire experiment, a headline read: \u201cThe Buds Are Back!\u201d This book circles repeatedly around to the subjects of race and class. The war on drugs was always really a war on marijuana, Mr. Kennedy suggests, because it was easier for cops. \u201cCriminals dealing drugs like heroin and cocaine,\u201d he writes, \u201cwould actually shoot back.\u201d Thus the war on drugs was waged mostly on hippies and slackers and the underprivileged. \u201cWe were dirty and disposable,\u201d Mr. Kennedy writes, \u201cand tens of millions of us were incarcerated for having fun.\u201d It\u2019s probably time to confess a personal debt to High Times. I\u2019m not a pot smoker. Weed often makes me paranoid, and in the evenings, I\u2019d rather sip from a kylix of cold gin. Once or twice a year at a party, though, standing in someone\u2019s backyard, I\u2019ll take a hit or two of a joint that\u2019s going around, just so I don\u2019t feel like a dweeb. One of these occasions turned out to be just before I learned I\u2019d have to take a urine test to be hired by The New York Times. I was terrified and later outraged that a tiny indiscretion, if that\u2019s the correct word, might prevent me from getting a job I badly wanted.So I purchased my first-ever issue of High Times. This was 1999. I scanned the rainbow assortment of ads, and I phoned for a mail-order shipment of detox tea with which I power-flushed my kidneys for a miserable week. Would I have passed the urine test anyway? Almost certainly. Was not doing the cleanse a risk worth taking? Definitely not. It was a moronic close call that gave me increased sympathy for people who had their lives upended for little good purpose, butterflies of a thousand species, each broken on the same wheel. So thank you, High Times, for fighting a long and lonely fight. Count me in with Bob Marley, who says in an interview printed here: \u201cOoo-eee! Ooo-eee! High Times!\u201d He adds, \u201cHigh Times only de bes\u2019.\u201d HIGH TIMESA 40-Year History of the World\u2019s Most Infamous MagazineIllustrated. 298 pages. powerHouse Books. $45.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Translating Moneyspeak Into English", "Date": "2014-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfHERE\u2019S a pop quiz: Can you define the following terms and explain why they are important to your investment portfolio?\u25a0 Dead-cat bounce.\u25a0 Inverted yield curve.\u25a0 Quantitative easing.If you aren\u2019t a full-fledged investing hound, you may have answered one or more with something like, \u201cI sort of know, I think.\u201dBut in light of all the upheaval since the Great Recession, Mr. Lanchester contends that you need to understand what financial experts mean when they use terms like the ones above. And, more important, you should see if you agree with their analysis of what these situations could mean for your investments.To help you, Mr. Lanchester, a British novelist and journalist, has written what amounts to a clever moneyspeak-to-English dictionary.And, for the most part, he succeeds quite well.The book divides neatly into two parts. He begins by explaining why it\u2019s important to understand financial terminology. From there, he creates a witty glossary. (Mortgage, he says, \u201cliterally means \u2018dead pledge.\u2019\u00a0\u201d He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a classic example of a financial entity that would scare people off if they thought more clearly about what it is: A highly leveraged form of long-term borrowing,\u201d one that is secured by \u201can illiquid asset known to be even more illiquid in difficult times.\u201d)Along the way, he sprinkles in fun facts \u2014 like the reason Alfred W. Jones, the man credited with creating the first hedge fund, chose to pay himself 20 percent of the fund\u2019s profits. (It was what \u201cPhoenician sea captains paid themselves after a successful voyage.\u201d) That 20 percent figure is now the industry standard, although many managers take 2 percent of the money under management as well.There are whimsical touches throughout. For example, in the glossary he includes \u201cC.R.E.A.M.\u201d This, he notes, is the title of \u201ca song by the Wu-Tang Clan that should be on the required-listening playlist for all who are or want to be in business for themselves.\u201d The title, he adds, is an acronym for \u201cCash Rules Everything About Me.\u201dAll this is entertaining even if you don\u2019t spend most of your day thinking about your finances.Oh, about those terms in the quiz above:A dead-cat bounce is Wall Street shorthand for \u201can apparent but illusory recovery in a falling market,\u201d Mr. Lanchester writes.\u201cIt\u2019s the same kind of bounce a dead cat would give if you chucked it out a window: not a very big one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re wondering who on earth would be so sick as to come up with a metaphor like that, greetings and welcome to the world of money.\u201d An inverted yield curve occurs when \u201cthings are weird and the economy is hitting hard times,\u201d he explains. When the times are tough, investors sometimes buy significant amounts of long-term debt to lock in higher interest rates, or yield. Thirty-year Treasury bonds are often in favor at moments like this. But the demand for that long-term debt drives up its price. Since price and yield are inversely correlated, rising prices cause yields to fall. \u201cThat can mean the longer-term debts end up with a lower yield than short-term debts\u201d like a one-year Treasury, he writes. The reason that\u2019s \u201cweird,\u201d to use Mr. Lanchester\u2019s word, is that long-term rates should be higher to compensate for the increased time the money is at risk. The aberration, he says, \u201cis a sure sign the market thinks there is severe trouble ahead.\u201d Finally, he says quantitative easing occurs when the government buys back its own debt. (Really, a quasi-independent central bank, like the Federal Reserve, is buying debt issued by the Treasury, which is without question a branch of the government. But Mr. Lanchester likes to keep things simple.) He explains this circular borrowing this way: \u201cThere\u2019s no particular benefit to that: It\u2019s like borrowing money from your neighbor and then paying the neighbor back the exact same amount. Nothing has changed. The trick in this case is that the money the government uses to buy back the debt is newly created. It\u2019s money that simply didn\u2019t exist before. It\u2019s like typing 100,000 at a keyboard and magically having $100,000 added to your bank account. Then you use that newly created money to pay off your debts.\u201d Introducing more money is supposed to stimulate the economy.Now you know.For all the appeal of his droll definitions and trenchant commentary, there are a couple of things that the author could have done better. The glossary feels a bit padded. I\u2019m in favor of overcommunicating, but I am not sure he needed to define such things as dividends, life expectancy and socialism. And the book would have benefited from a wider use of simple charts and graphs to better explain some of the terms, like the aforementioned yield curve. But these are small complaints. Mr. Lanchester provides a useful service in an amusing way. And it seems only right to give him the last word: \u201cThe bafflement that people feel at the language of money contains a note of outrage \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be this complicated \u2014 and a note of self-doubt \u2014 I should be able to understand this on my own. Both are misplaced. The language isn\u2019t impossibly complicated, but it isn\u2019t transparent and nobody understands it automatically and innately. Once you learn it though, the world does start to look different.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video: The Mercedes-Benz C300 is Upwardly Mobile", "Date": "2014-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has been speculated that premium automotive brands are in a race to the bottom with entry-level cars like the Audi A3 and the Mercedes-Benz CLA. The job of these small upmarket sedans is to seduce younger buyers away from mainstream brands with starting prices in the $30,000 range. But good luck finding those unicorns: Adding destination and options to the A3 and the CLA easily pushes them into the mid-30s.Mercedes has used this strategy before, bringing the diminutive 190E to the United States in 1983. Popular in Europe, the so-called Baby Benz was mostly sneered at here (perhaps because of the lingering bad taste left by the Cadillac Cimarron). Eventually, the 190E grew into the respectable sedan that we now know as the C-Class.The 2015 C-Class is all grown up and bears a strong physical resemblance to the Mercedes family patriarch, the S-Class sedan. The interior, filled with premium materials, appears fully German, tangibly luxurious and authentically Mercedes-Benz. Watch your back, E-Class.Choosing between the C300, which comes with a 241-horsepower turbo-charged 2-liter 4-cylinder engine, and the C400, which packs a 329-horsepower twin-turbo V6, means picking a distinct character. The C400\u2019s deep reserve of power is reassuring when passing on two-lane mountain roads. The lighter C300 is more deft and nimble in the urban slalom.The C300 scoots to 60 miles per hour in around 6.5 seconds. The cabin is quiet and the car comfortably gobbles up highway miles. It\u2019s good fun when the roads turn twisty, too. Most likely, few owners will push their cars hard enough to discover the difference between the C-Class and the perceived handling champ in the luxury small car segment, the BMW 3 Series. Truth be told, for hard romps I prefer the Cadillac ATS over both.The biggest barrier to ownership is price. The C300 4Matic begins at $41,325, thousands more than a comparably equipped 3 Series, Audi A4, Cadillac ATS or Lexus IS; the C300 tops out at just over $58,000. But climb into the infinitely adjustable driver\u2019s chair and survey the world from the car\u2019s well-appointed cabin and that fee seems justified. Now that the CLA is holding down the marque\u2019s bottom slot, the C-Class has permission to move upscale.Advertisement"}
