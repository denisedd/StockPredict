{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Playing Marbles Now?", "Date": "2014-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHmmm. Marbles. That\u2019s an interesting metaphor. Actually, it turns out that Obama was the one playing chess and Putin was the one playing marbles, and it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say today that Putin\u2019s lost most of his \u2014 in both senses of the word.Let us not mince words: Vladimir Putin is a delusional thug. He created, fell in love with and is now being disabused of a fantasy notion of his and Russia\u2019s power. Might he lash out militarily now to distract his people with more shiny objects? Yes, he might, but then he\u2019d only be violating another rule of geopolitics: \u201cThe First Rule of Holes\u201d \u2014 when you\u2019re in one, stop digging. I say that with no satisfaction. In fact, I say it with deep regret. I opposed NATO expansion and our unilateral ripping up of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, when Russia was weak. I wanted \u2014 and still want \u2014 to see America partner with Russia to help stem global disorder, because in many places in the world we can\u2019t be effective without a Russian partner. Alas, we expanded NATO \u2014 and unintentionally helped to foster the political conditions in Russia for Putin\u2019s xenophobic, grievance-based politics to flourish.But Putin also went nuts. Oil at $110 a barrel went to his head. He thought all of this was about him, his decisions, the economy he and his cronies built and on some Russian geopolitical entitlement based on history. In reality, he had bet everything on drilling oil and gas, not on building his people and their talents. He rode the price up and now it is riding him down.Putin cast all of that as a C.I.A.-NATO plot in order to rally the Russian people to his side and justify his ugly grab of Crimea and his Ukraine intervention, which included indirect involvement in the shooting down of a Malaysian civilian airliner. The real truth is that Putin is not afraid of NATO expansion to Ukraine. That was never in the cards. He is afraid of European Union expansion. He does not want Ukraine to join the European customs union, adopt its anti-corruption and transparency regulations and begin to build a successful economy on European principles that every day would stand as a contrast to and critique of the nontransparent kleptocracy Putin and his oil-and-gas clique have built in Russia.His big delusion is that his mind-set is trapped in a 19th-century worldview, where Russia is entitled to and will always have \u201cspheres of influence\u201d on its borders. But spheres of influence are not like some honorary degree you get from Moscow University and can keep forever. Today, spheres of influence have to be earned and re-earned. Because, today, thanks to technology, emergent citizens are able to articulate and organize for their own aspirations much more effectively. These are \u201cpeople of influence,\u201d and they\u2019ve asserted themselves in squares from Tahrir to Taksim to the Maidan in Kiev. Ukraine may be the first battleground in history where people of influence have squared off against a sphere-of-influence thinker. I am still betting on the people.Russia\u2019s decline is bad for Russians, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is good for us. When the world gets this interconnected and interdependent, you get a strategic reverse: Your friends, through economic mismanagement (see Greece), can harm you faster than your enemies. And your rivals falling (see Russia and China) can be more dangerous than your rivals rising. If Russia, an economy spanning nine time zones, goes into recession and cannot pay foreign lenders with its lower oil revenues \u2014 and all this leads to political turmoil and defaults to Western banks \u2014 that crash will be felt globally.Warren Buffett observed during the 2008 economic crisis that \u201conly when the tide goes out do you find out who is not wearing a bathing suit.\u201d Well, the oil tide has gone out, and it revealed that Putin was swimming naked. In doing so, the country he threatens most today is Russia \u2014 but not Russia alone. A triumphant, oil-fueled Russia riding a petro-surge is dangerous; but a defeated, angry, increasingly impoverished Russia is dangerous as well. So despite all of the above, I\u2019d be willing to see the West work with Putin to ease the sanctions on Russia, but only if Putin is ready to stop stealing other people\u2019s marbles, only if he is truly ready to be part of the solution in places like Ukraine \u2014 not the problem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quit Whining About Your Sick Colleague", "Date": "2014-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWE all know the type: the colleague who comes in to work, red-eyed and drippy, and puts his germy fingers on the handle of the coffeepot or the button of the microwave door. He could have called in sick, but that would take a modicum of decency. No, this guy is a \u201cteam player.\u201d He\u2019s a cubicle Cal Ripken Jr., the office iron man with Sudafed.We may hate him for his selfish play at martyrdom, but we\u2019re too polite to say so. Instead we squirt Purell on our hands and feign concern: \u201cYou seem a little under the weather. Why not take the rest of the day off?\u201d Behind his back it\u2019s an open season of sniping and reproach: He\u2019s the one who\u2019s feverish and suffering, but we can\u2019t stop ourselves from taking umbrage at his grief. His zeal for overwork is putting us at risk.Or is it? You may have seen reports about the spread of germs at work. (The media love these tales of viral diaspora.) One of the latest comes from Charles P. Gerba, a University of Arizona microbiologist who placed a (harmless) tracer virus on the front-door handle of an 80-person office. Within four hours, he found the virus on more than half the workers\u2019 hands and more than half the common surfaces. That fact, widely covered in the press, makes it sound as if we should impose a policy of office-worker quarantine. But this was more a gross-out stunt than a risk assessment. The mere presence of a marker virus doesn\u2019t tell us which, if any, office workers might be likely to contract a real infection. In fact, there\u2019s not much evidence that office cubicles are any more infectious than, say, subways or supermarkets. Hospitals, day care centers, cruise ships, senior homes: These are places where people interact with body fluids, and transmission risk is high. In office buildings, we just don\u2019t have the same degree of contact. The studies of productivity do hint at a deeper problem, though \u2014 one that has less to do with public health than mass psychology. What motivates our colleague to show up in an unwell state, and why should his presence in the office make the rest of us so edgy, sometimes to the point of anger? Perhaps we all share a common ailment of the workplace, a condition whose major symptom is the morbid fear of downtime. Maybe we\u2019re afraid of staying home because we\u2019re so well-trained to stay at work.If overwork can be taken as a sickness in itself, then America is a bastion of infirmity. We clock in some 1,788 hours a year, 120 more than our counterparts in Britain, 300 more than our counterparts in France and 400 more than our counterparts in Germany. (Workaholism is most acute among people with at least a college education \u2014 i.e., the office type.) America, notoriously, does not require employers to offer paid sick leave. Employers grant new employees just eight sick days, on average, down 20 percent since 1993, and that\u2019s only what we have on paper. In other words, the American workplace has gotten tangled up in endless searches for a dose of extra credit. Since we\u2019re all in competition \u2014 if I slow down, you get ahead \u2014 no one has an incentive to untie the knot. When we see a colleague with a runny nose, it only makes that conflict more explicit. We act as if we\u2019re worried for his health, or troubled that his work-life balance might be out of whack, but in truth we\u2019re just as driven by the mania for overwork. We\u2019d prefer for him to take his sick days now only so that we won\u2019t have to, down the line.The problem is, putting pressure on the presentee only serves to fortify the status quo. It treats illness as a threat to productivity rather than a source of suffering. Let\u2019s try to have a bit more empathy. Instead of raging at officemates who try too hard, praise the ones who do their part to slow the rat race down. Support the slacker \u2014 or better yet, be a slacker. Take some extra time. Stay home. That\u2019s how we can show that it\u2019s O.K. to take it easy, and that a happy, healthy life needn\u2019t be a source of shame.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Is Ordered by Spain and Thailand to Halt Operations", "Date": "2014-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A run of bad news for Uber continued on Tuesday, when Spain and Thailand ordered the ride-sharing service to cease operations in the two countries.Also on Monday, a Dutch appeals court upheld that Uber drivers who transport passengers without a taxi license are violating Dutch law. The court said the company would be subject to immediate fines if it continued to operate its UberPop service, which enables any licensed driver with a car and Uber-issued device to pick up passengers.Uber, which is based in San Francisco, said in a statement Tuesday that the Madrid judge\u2019s ruling was \u201cinconsistent with broad political acknowledgment in Spain and across the European Union on the benefits of sharing economy services.'\u2019\u201cWe\u2019ll defend ourselves in anyway we can legally,\u201d Susanne Elias-Stulemeijer, an Uber spokeswoman in London added in a phone interview.

{"Headline": "Oil Falls to 5-Year Low, and Energy Companies Start to Retrench", "Date": "2014-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 The price of crude oil continued to collapse on Monday, plunging to a five-year low, as oil giants began to scale back their drilling ambitions and pare the ranks of their workers.On the same day that the American oil benchmark traded around $63 a barrel, down more than 4 percent, ConocoPhillips announced it would cut investment spending in 2015 by 20 percent, the biggest sign yet that major oil companies are contracting.The announcement came on the heels of BP\u2019s notice that it would cut middle management and other jobs in the months ahead.Both moves suggested that the 40 percent drop in oil prices since July had spread pain beyond small exploration companies that were highly leveraged and most vulnerable to oil price swings.\u201cWe are setting our 2015 capital budget at a level that we believe is prudent given the current environment,\u201d said Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips\u2019s chairman and chief executive.But even with the sharp cut in investments, the company projected that its oil and gas production would grow 3 percent next year because of recent start-ups of major projects in Canada, Europe and Asia, as well as increasingly productive wells being drilled in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale fields of Texas and North Dakota.Energy experts say that more production will most likely lead to even lower oil prices, unless the economies of Europe and Asia recover more quickly than expected or if there is a major new political disruption in the Middle East or North Africa.Wall Street analysts continued to lower their predictions of where oil prices are headed in 2015, with some projecting that global oil prices could break below even $50 a barrel \u2014 the biggest collapse since prices briefly plunged by about two-thirds during the most recent recession.\u201cWith OPEC on the sidelines, oil prices face the greatest threat since 2009 and appear to be on track for a volatile 2015,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a commodity report on Monday. But the report added that \u201coversupply is likely exaggerated and the market may be complacent about upside risks.\u201dSo far, the drop in oil prices has been a boon for consumers. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $2.67 on Monday, according to the AAA auto club, 27 cents lower than a month ago and 59 cents below a year ago. Energy experts say that every 10-cent drop in gasoline prices translates into a $120 in annual savings for the typical family that consumes 1,200 gallons a year.But economists say the full consequences of the oil price drop, while positive over all, are hard to predict fully. Several oil-producing states, including Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Alaska, are bound to be hurt since so much of their employment and tax revenue are based on oil and gas. Already in Oklahoma, monthly energy tax revenue in November declined from the year before by more than 5 percent, the first time there had been a drop in nearly two years.And beyond the recent announcements of cutbacks, companies like ConocoPhillips are considering deferring investments in oil fields around the globe, especially in high-priced offshore and shale fields. The Norwegian oil giant Statoil has announced job cuts, and suspended or canceled rig contracts. Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron cut jobs in their North Sea operations even before oil prices plunged.Precision Drilling, Canada\u2019s largest oil and gas drilling contractor and a global player, announced Monday that it was cutting its capital spending next year by 44 percent.Raymond James on Monday issued a report highlighting budget reductions of oil field service companies. \u201cPeak to trough, we think the total U.S. rig count will decrease by 587 total rigs (or nearly 30 percent) by mid-2016,\u201d Raymond James projected.\u201cIn a low-price environment, investments are harder to justify,\u201d said Michael E. Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. Mr. Webber added that what was happening had occurred repeatedly in the oil business over the last century.\u201cThis is what commodity markets do,\u201d Mr. Webber said. \u201cThey go to high price, and high price inspires new production and also inspires consumers to use less. After a couple of years of that, prices collapse. Then low prices inspire consumers to consume more and encourage suppliers to turn off production. Then you get a supply shortage and prices go back up.\u201dGlobally, economists project that countries with high fuel import bills like Japan and China should benefit from lower energy costs. China\u2019s trade surplus soared in November to a new high because of steeply falling prices for oil and other imported commodities. India and Indonesia have already been able to shave subsidies on gasoline to reduce their burdensome fiscal deficits.The drop in oil prices may even hurt natural gas exporting countries since gas prices are often tied to oil prices in European and Asian markets. Along with a projected supply surge between 2015 and 2019, lower prices could jeopardize several large proposed liquefied natural gas export projects in the United States and Canada.The Malaysian national oil company Petronas last week announced that it was delaying a final investment decision on a $36 billion liquefied natural gas project it was leading in British Columbia.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stockholm\u2019s Housing Shortage Threatens to Stifle Fast-Growing Start-Ups", "Date": "2014-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTOCKHOLM \u2014 Tyler Faux thought finding a place to live in New York City was tough.Faced with Sweden\u2019s labyrinthine rules on renting apartments and a decades-long waiting list for government housing, Mr. Faux, a Harvard computer science graduate, repeatedly came up empty when hunting for housing \u2014 no matter how much he was willing to spend.\u201cIn New York, there are ways to find a good apartment if you\u2019re willing to pay,\u201d said Mr. Faux, who eventually signed a short-term lease for a one-bedroom apartment in the center of Stockholm for $1,700 a month, much less than what most New Yorkers pay for a similar apartment. \u201cBut in Sweden, that doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s difficult to find a place here.\u201dMr. Faux\u2019s housing troubles are becoming a common refrain in Stockholm and other technology hubs around the world. The Swedish capital has emerged as one of Europe\u2019s most attractive tech centers in recent years, luring thousands of workers and developers to companies like Spotify, the popular music-streaming service that was started here.But the city also has become a cautionary tale about the troubles that arise when a booming tech sector runs head-on into city planning rules that have not changed for decades.Swedish rent controls and other housing restrictions in place since the 1960s make it almost impossible for people to lease out apartments to foreign tech workers. And a backlog of new construction means that only 10,000 new homes are expected to be built annually over the next 15 years, though Stockholm\u2019s local government has fast-tracked some new residential developments.In contrast, roughly 40,000 people \u2014 both from inside Sweden and outside the country \u2014 are now moving to the city to work for tech companies, financial firms and other Swedish businesses each year, according to Stockholm\u2019s city government.\u201cThe system is completely broken,\u201d said Billy McCormac, an American who moved to Sweden in the 1990s and now campaigns for housing reform as head of the Stockholm branch of the Swedish Property Federation, an industry group. \u201cWe can\u2019t build a tech cluster here if people don\u2019t have anywhere to live.\u201dThe lack of housing was a regular hot topic of discussion at one of Stockholm\u2019s co-working spaces \u2014 where early-stage tech companies swap ideas over games of Ping-Pong. On the fifth floor of a modern building in the main shopping district here, engineers at the space, called SUP46, grumbled that they could not find places to live.\u201cRenting something is almost impossible,\u201d said Fritjof Andersson, 33, over a cup of coffee at the shared office. Mr. Andersson started his first tech company more than a decade ago, but now cannot afford to bring international developers to the Swedish capital to expand his small team.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the financial muscle to help them find an apartment,\u201d he said, adding that he was recently forced to limit a search for new coders to people already living in Stockholm. \u201cIf the city wants to attract start-ups, someone needs to fix the housing problem.\u201dMany people in Stockholm welcome the new workers. But critics say the newly arrived, who often have salaries that dwarf local residents, should not be given priority over people who have lived in neighborhoods for decades.\u201cRents going up will only force people to move out of their homes,\u201d said Marie Linder, chairwoman of the Swedish Union of Tenants, which represents the rights of existing renters, many of whom live in low-cost government housing. \u201cPeople will have to leave their apartments, but where will they go?\u201dThe complaints are echoed in other cities with a heavy concentration of tech companies. In San Francisco, local residents have complained bitterly that 20-something engineers and developers have transformed entire neighborhoods, where upmarket wine bars and expensive yoga studios have replaced down-on-their-luck bookstores and family-run coffee shops.Yet as the average salary rises in many cities, local planners say the often-rapid gentrification can benefit the majority of a city\u2019s population.In London, one of Europe\u2019s largest technology centers, local tech companies are expected to create almost 50,000 jobs and add $19 billion to the local economy over the next decade, according to Oxford Economics, which provides economic forecasting.Some of that money, though, is returned to the tech industry in the form of tax breaks for people starting businesses and government grants for local start-ups. That has led some urban policy researchers to argue that a level of inequality is inevitable if policy makers focus their attention on attracting people from a single industry over other priorities.\u201cIn cities, competition for space and resources is fierce,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, who tracks how cities like New York, Berlin and London have handled the tension between new industries and existing residents. \u201cIf you want to offer the right incentives to attract tech companies, you\u2019re not going to maintain an equitable society.\u201dLocal residents have felt the pinch in many cities with a growing tech industry.In Shoreditch \u2014 a once run-down working-class community in East London \u2014 house prices now regularly top more than $1 million, roughly a 50 percent increase over the last decade. And as Berlin continues to be hit with a steady tide of tech workers, the country\u2019s government has said it will now set price caps on rental apartments to protect existing tenants.\u201cIn Berlin, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of grumbling about foreigners moving in,\u201d said Alex Farcet, a co-founder of Startupbootcamp, which offers short-term mentorship programs for tech entrepreneurs in places like Berlin, Amsterdam and London. \u201cIt can be super-difficult for people to find housing.\u201dThe tension between the so-called global technorati and cities\u2019 residents is a relatively new phenomenon. Tech giants like Apple, Microsoft and Nokia have long operated primarily in business parks located in the suburbs, or on the outskirts of a city.\u201cI want to live close to where I work. I don\u2019t want to commute very far,\u201d said Lovisa Nilsson, who traveled from Uppsala, a city roughly an hour north of Stockholm, to her tech job in the Swedish capital for more than a year before finally securing a short-term contract for a small apartment here that she now shares with her boyfriend.\u201cI was lucky to find somewhere to live,\u201d Ms. Nilsson said. \u201cI wanted to move a lot earlier, but had almost given up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018SoHo\u2019 Lofts Go to China", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig DealThey sound like an old-school SoHo artist\u2019s dream: large unfinished lofts with double-height ceilings, oversize windows and access to a private garden. The duplex units come with industrial-chic accents like exposed cement and hardwood floors, and their layouts are ideal for living on one floor while creating a work studio below.\u00a0But they are not in SoHo. They are not even in New York City, or, for that matter, the United States.\u00a0These lofts are underway in Shenyang, a large industrial city of about 8 million in northeast China, not far from the North Korean border. Rather than touting a proximity to the Bleecker Street subway, the apartments are being built atop a 12-line bus depot, and instead of bohemian artists, their residents will likely be Internet-savvy Chinese millennials.\u00a0They are being designed by a California architectural firm.These Chinese \u201cSoHo lofts\u201d \u2014 or SOHO, all caps, in the marketing materials \u2014 are not just distinctive for their moniker. That they are live/work units suggests a shift in China, an acknowledgment by developers there that some of the younger generation are eschewing more traditional roles and venturing into entrepreneurialism and creative fields.\u00a0In China, generations are defined by the decades in which they were born, and those born in the 1980s are among the first to struggle to find jobs and follow the strict path that was prescribed for them. \u201cThis generation started to question if they really wanted to get married, or buy a house or work in an office,\u201d said Mary Bergstrom, the founder of the Bergstrom Group, a consulting firm based in Shanghai and San Francisco. \u201cThose born in the 1990s have taken that a step further, with a lot of freelancers or entrepreneurs with start-ups. In China, the word Soho also means a small home office, so it is clear that the developers are tapping into this.\u201dAnd it isn\u2019t just the project size that is enormous. Shenyang, an ancient city with more than 2,000 years of history that was the birthplace of the Qing dynasty in the 17th century, has the same population as New York City. Yet despite its size, Shenyang is considered a second- or even third-tier city, an industrial and transportation center that is about an hour\u2019s flight from Pyongyang and two hours from Beijing.\u00a0\u201cWhat would be an enormous project in the States barely raises an eyebrow in China,\u201d said Joel H. Rothstein, a partner in the real estate group at the law firm Paul Hastings, who splits his time between Los Angeles and Beijing. \u201cYou walk through these real estate fairs and everywhere you look, there are models of enormous condominium tower after enormous condominium tower for sale.\u201d\u00a0In smaller cities like Shenyang, this slowdown has been particularly acute. \u201cCities that have been hurt the most by the cooling of the residential market are these second-, third- and fourth-tier cities where there has been a lot of overdevelopment,\u201d Mr. Rothstein said.\u00a0In light of the increased competition for residential housing, appealing to young Chinese buyers may be a useful strategy.\u00a0\u201cYoung Chinese, those born post-1990, are becoming much more individualistic,\u201d said Eric Fish, a freelance journalist who covers China and whose book\u00a0\u201cChina\u2019s Millennials: The Want Generation\u201d\u00a0will be published by Rowman & Littlefield next summer. \u201cShows like \u2018Friends\u2019 are hugely popular, so they have seen apartments like Rachel and Monica\u2019s, so I can see these kind of lofts as being immensely appealing.\u201dBy several measures, the live/work lofts will be a strong selling point. \u201cThe younger generation in China are becoming more entrepreneurial and they want something that is more modern, that is nontraditional,\u201d Mr. Li said. According to the bank\u2019s research, the target buyers will be entrepreneurs in their late 30s and early 40s who will live there and house their businesses there. They could also be investors who will buy the units and then rent them out to people in their 20s and 30s.\u00a0Diamond Hill, which is scheduled for completion in the first half of 2017, had several design complexities aside from its sheer size. Perhaps most challenging was a Shenyang building code that stipulated condos must receive a minimum of two hours of sunshine on the shortest day of the year, and across from Diamond Hill are several condominium towers whose light must be protected. Protecting daylight can be a tall order in this northern city, where winter lasts from November until April, with temperatures that can reach minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit.\u00a0To comply with the code, the architects analyzed the sun\u2019s path across the site and combined the results with the development\u2019s height restrictions and zoning. The results are towers of varying heights, shaped in an elongated hexagon. The buildings circle an interior atrium with skylights to allow light to filter through as well as a roof garden.\u201cWe had to create an envelope, under which the project had to fit,\u201d said Ram\u00f3n Hone, a principal at 5+design, which has 16 projects completed or near completion in China. \u201cIt dictated the shape of the building and helped inform the unique design.\u201d\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Missing Its Own Goals, Germany Renews Effort to Cut Carbon Emissions ", "Date": "2014-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new plan was unveiled by a country eager to retain a leadership position in international talks to address the threat from global warming. The plan underscored Ms. Merkel\u2019s commitment despite the problems it has caused her at home.The plan calls on Germans to cut an additional 62 million to 78 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the annual output of about seven million German households. That would triple emission reductions from current levels, spreading the cuts across sectors like agriculture and automobiles.The program, which would be established by laws to be passed by Parliament, rests on improved energy efficiency, with 3 billion euros, or $3.7 billion, in tax breaks and other incentives.Roughly a third of the cuts are to come from the power industry, even as coal-fired plants continue to play an essential role.Germany\u2019s predicament reflects the difficulty faced by modern economies in reducing carbon as an energy source. But polls show that most Germans favor reducing emissions.\u201cIf we want to keep our promise, we need to close this gap, and that is what we are doing,\u201d Barbara Hendricks, Ms. Merkel\u2019s environment minister, said at a news conference on Wednesday.Ms. Merkel made her debut on the international stage as Germany\u2019s environment minister by marshaling support for the Kyoto agreement in 1997, and has made it clear that she wants Germany to remain at the forefront of efforts to combat climate change.Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s announcement, members of the union had gathered thousands of signatures demanding German leaders provide \u201caffordable electricity and good jobs.\u201d Sigmar Gabriel, the minister for economic affairs and energy, has pledged to give utilities free rein to decide where and how they make further emissions cuts, with an eye to unions\u2019 close ties to his center-left Social Democratic Party.Last year, 45 percent of Germany\u2019s power came from hard coal and the soft brown coal known as lignite, the highest level since 2007, according to data from AG Energiebilanzen, a group of energy lobbying firms and economic research institutes. That compares with 25 percent of energy from renewable resources.Since Germany began shutting down its 17 nuclear power plants, a drive that gained speed after the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, it has increasingly depended on coal-fired plants for the flow of power needed by the country\u2019s large industrial base. Its dependence on coal is the highest in nearly 25 years, when many of East Germany\u2019s worst-polluting factories and plants were shut down after reunification with the West.Soft coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel to burn, is Germany\u2019s cheapest and most abundant natural resource. Hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on the lignite mines and the power industry they support, and workers are growing increasingly fearful that Germany\u2019s energy revolution will cost them their livelihoods.Frank L\u00f6llgen, the head of the trade union\u2019s western North Rhine region, said the trend worried the 107,000 workers he represented. The union has been urging the government to remember energy\u2019s role in the economy\u2019s continuing the success it has had in recent years.\u201cWe already are on the edge of what is possible,\u201d Mr. L\u00f6llgen said in an interview at his D\u00fcsseldorf office. \u201cIs it worth it if we as a country succeed in reaching our targets in reducing carbon emissions, but sacrifice good jobs and our industrial base?\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an outdated title for Sigmar Gabriel. He is currently Germany\u2019s minister for economic affairs and energy, and no longer the environment minister.

{"Headline": "Anthologies", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a group of people band together to start a magazine, they are sure to make purring noises about creating \u201ca space for dialogue\u201d or \u201ca forum for voices that are not being heard,\u201d but the voices they really want to hear are their own. And usually they\u2019re prepared to spend someone else\u2019s money on it.When Herbert Croly teamed up with a wealthy couple to launch The New Republic, he told them: \u201cThe whole point is that we are trying to impose views on blind or reluctant people.\u201dFour important journals that range the American landscape of ideas have published anthologies in recent months, The New Republic the eldest among them. A century ago, the views its founders wanted to impose represented a synthesis of political ideas that were then often in conflict. Big business was compatible with the public interest, the theory went, as long as it was counterbalanced by a strong and active central government. Today this is no longer a novel doctrine: It is modern liberalism, more or less.A succession of exacting minds including Malcolm Cowley, Edmund Wilson, Alfred Kazin and Leon Wieseltier has kept West\u2019s ideal in sight while overseeing the magazine\u2019s books coverage. Though the literary section has championed a long line of writers, it has become better known for deflating prominent figures with conspicuous glee. Franklin Foer, until recently the magazine\u2019s editor, collects some of the best takedowns here, such as the brilliant 1986 skewering of the pundit George Will by Henry Fairlie and Hendrik Hertzberg\u2019s hilarious 1991 review of two books about Ronald Reagan. But the anthology would probably better reflect the history if it gave a bit more play to pieces about literature and the arts. We get none of Wilson\u2019s criticism, nor any of Kazin\u2019s. We get James Wood\u2019s evisceration of Norman Mailer\u2019s \u201cThe Gospel According to the Son\u201d (not one of the Mailer books that would make for a truly worthy adversary), but missing is Wood\u2019s landmark 2000 essay diagnosing a trend of \u201chysterical realism\u201d in fiction, a term Zadie Smith called a \u201cpainfully accurate\u201d description of her early work.Foer could have created the space by sacrificing the more windy pieces from the early decades, a few of which read like speeches from a Democratic National Convention. The book is also light on female contributors, a fault that lies with the publication itself, which has long favored young white guys and is hardly alone among political outlets in having done a poor job of cultivating and retaining female talent.The anthology nevertheless provides a spirited intellectual tour of the century. In his lucid introduction and in editorial notes, Foer is laudably candid about the magazine\u2019s failings at a number of historical junctures, even referring to several \u201cdisgraceful contributions to American life,\u201d including Betsy McCaughey\u2019s influential and profoundly misleading 1994 attack on President Clinton\u2019s health care reform proposal.Foer nonetheless poses The New Republic as a consistent vehicle of liberalism and the anthology as \u201ca refutation of liberalism\u2019s critics,\u201d but in so doing he defines the term rather broadly. As he notes, the magazine has published figures as conservative as Irving Kristol and Charles Krauthammer and wholeheartedly supported, for instance, President Reagan\u2019s backing of the contras in Nicaragua. (That position was attacked, however, within the pages of the same issue.) Part of The New Republic\u2019s value lies in its inconsistency. Some of its most celebrated work grew out of the kind of intramural dissension that held sway in the \u201980s, when Hertzberg and Michael Kinsley, as editors, chafed under the active ownership of Martin Peretz, who had taken a rightward turn, particularly on the subject of Israel. George Will deemed The New Republic \u201cthe nation\u2019s most interesting and important political journal\u201d in 1984 \u2014 and two years later, Fairlie expertly filleted his work in the magazine. Don\u2019t get too comfortable.The New Republic has made some egregious missteps. Its mockery of antiwar voices under the heading \u201cIdiocy Watch\u201d during the run-up to the Iraq war, for example, should be a lasting source of embarrassment. But complaints of incoherence or confusion often read as masks for the true complaint \u2014 that unlike many of its rivals, the magazine does not indulge a reader\u2019s desire to encounter only the views he already has.While The New Republic tacked to the right under its editor Andrew Sullivan, a new journal called The Baffler was throwing bombs from its left-hand side. Started by recent college graduates in 1988 and most closely associated with the founding editor Thomas Frank, The Baffler hit its stride in the \u201990s. The Berlin Wall had come down, the American economy was steadily expanding, and Bill Clinton was leading the Democrats to the center. We were hearing that it was the end of history, that the free-market system had won. The Baffler was having none of it. What was the almighty free market doing but letting the strong crush the weak, co-opting all resistance and repackaging it as a consumer good? \u201cCommodify Your Dissent\u201d was the delicious title of the journal\u2019s first collection of greatest hit jobs, published in 1997.The Baffler bears something in common with Ethan Hawke\u2019s character in the 1994 movie \u201cReality Bites,\u201d who sneered at the squares while sitting out the whole career thing to read Heidegger, but the magazine is angrier, funnier and a lot smarter. It\u2019s also a little juvenile, but that\u2019s the idea.In a 1994 issue, Frank nailed a certain kind of youthful despond, prevalent in the grunge era but timeless too: \u201cEven while we are happily dazed by the mall\u2019s panoply of choice, exhorted to indulge our taste for breaking rules and deluged with all manner of useful \u2018information,\u2019 our collective mental universe is being radically circumscribed, enclosed within the tightest parameters of all time. In the third millennium there is to be no myth but the business myth, no individuality but the 30 or so professionally accepted psychographic market niches, no diversity but the happy heteroglossia of the sitcom, no rebellion but the preprogrammed search for new kicks.\u201dThe trouble isn\u2019t the writing, which remains uncommonly fresh and stylish. Standouts collected in these pages include David Graeber\u2019s provocative and original exploration of the once-\u00adpredicted technological innovations that have not come to pass (\u201cWhere, in short, are the flying cars?\u201d); a bravura Heather Havrilesky performance that frames the \u201cFifty Shades\u201d series of erotic novels as a fairy tale of class ascendancy; and Evgeny Morozov\u2019s mercilessly precise dissection of the Silicon Valley thinker Tim O\u2019Reilly.But the rhetoric-to-fact ratio is too high in this book. Pieces stray from analysis into harangue with little groundwork underlying bold claims. When the opening paragraph of an essay characterizes Harvard as \u201cAmerica\u2019s most highly self-regarded institution of advanced credentialing,\u201d it\u2019s good for a laugh, but we get the sense the author is more interested in venting than probing or persuading. Graeber describes antidepressants and Ritalin as if they were corporate tools for social control, meant to placate the workers. One writer picks on one of those glossy free magazines that cheer on local businesses, an easy target, and another zeros in on the banal, misspelled remarks of unnamed Facebook commenters to make a point about Sheryl Sandberg and her following. It\u2019s a little like critiquing capitalism by punching a hapless banker.During the decade when The Baffler lay mostly dormant, two significant journals arrived. Both were founded by people around the age of 30, but they adopted quite different stances toward their generation and toward the culture at large. The divide between the two has generated a larger continuing debate concerning the tone of literary discourse.In 2003, the first issue of The Believer came off the presses, another hopeful offering from the publishing mini-empire of Dave Eggers, whose memoir \u201cA Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\u201d had made him something of a cult hero among the young and bookish. The cover of the magazine, then as now, presented a riot of colors and skillful illustrations in a grid, a visual vocabulary reminiscent of the graphic novel. The following year, n+1 showed its severe face. The debut looked vaguely Russian, a no-frills solid red with black and white text. Drawings are for kids, it seemed to say, and in fact the arrogant opening pages criticized The Believer for being fixated on childhood.Which was unfair, but not untrue. The Believer is interested in many things, childhood among them (and what\u2019s wrong with that? the editors might ask), and it seeks to channel the youthful openness to wide experience that tends to decline with age. Its new anthology, collecting work published in the last five years, leads us by the hand through vistas of oddball endeavors, comic failures and emotional pain. The ideal audience might be the well-educated cubicle-dweller who is bored by an unchallenging job and wants to be reminded that the world can be mysterious and beautiful.The editors, Heidi Julavits and Ed Park, have also gathered more forceful work, including Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah\u2019s searching profile of the comedian Dave Chappelle, which examines the roots of his race consciousness and his decision to step away from a major career. And in a short but potent piece, Susan Straight weaves an affecting portrait of her mixed-race family into an unsentimental account of a charged encounter they had with the police.Although some writers have appeared in both venues, the dichotomy between the aims of The Believer and n+1 remains steadfast. A working title for The Believer was The Optimist, and it often seeks to share enthusiasms and counter the elitism of literary culture. The editors have announced their view that \u201cbooks are inherently good.\u201d The spirit of n+1 implicitly rejects that notion, suggesting instead that books are situated on a battleground; some of them are misguided or dangerous and must be fought.In recent years, n+1 has become involved in political activism \u2014 it produced a spinoff gazette during the Occupy movement \u2014 but its biggest contribution lies not in advancing a particular set of ideas but in promoting a certain way of thinking, wide-ranging and curious but demanding and rigorous.The style of the journal is disputatious, sometimes downright mean. Even the fiction is aggressive. The stories collected here, a strange and darkly funny piece by Rebecca Curtis and a look into Baltimore gang life from Lawrence Jackson, are the kind that make other writers wonder if they\u2019re doing it wrong.For n+1, the ideal audience might be the self-serious comp-lit graduate student who is committed to the life of the mind but suspects that the world of the pop-culture Internet she encounters while procrastinating might be more urgent than the concerns of the campus. n+1 resides somewhere between the academy and the society, and it pushes both the upper and lower bounds of typical intellectual discourse. It has provoked eye-rolls by knowingly name-dropping impenetrable works of critical theory, and it\u2019s provoked eye-rolls by devoting extended attention to the Octomom, the history of Gawker and extreme online pornography.Every generation is embarrassed by its own cultural phenomena \u2014 significant things happen in the past or the White House; n+1, meanwhile, is almost bizarrely unembarrassed to take seriously the ephemera of the times. This is a risky act. It does not always work, but when it does, it\u2019s something to see.A roundup review of literary anthologies on Page 70 this weekend contains outdated information about Franklin Foer, who edited the anthology \u201cInsurrections of the Mind: 100 Years of Politics and Culture in America.\u201d After the issue had gone to press, Mr. Foer, who had been editor of The New Republic, abruptly resigned the post in the face of a disagreement about the magazine\u2019s direction.Evan Hughes is the author of \u201cThe Trials of White Boy Rick\u201d and \u201cLiterary Brooklyn.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Luxury Buyer: Younger, Richer and Well-Wired", "Date": "2014-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 For decades, it seemed, the most avid patrons of exclusive boutiques around the world sprang from a predictable, almost monolithic, caste of global elites: Prominent men and women of the baby-boom generation, who traveled extensively \u2014 and at a high standard \u2014 for both business and leisure, and whose appreciation of the quality and heritage of top luxury brands had been cultivated across generations.But in recent years, this reliable core of the luxury consumer base has become a shrinking force in the global marketplace as the newly wealthy economies of China, India, Brazil and Southeast Asia have churned out young buyers with a hunger for markers of status and sophistication. Last year, more than 330 million people consumed luxury products worldwide, representing 217 billion euros, or about $270 billion, according to Bain & Company, a Boston-based consulting firm. Of those consumers, around 150 million are considered to be \u201ctrue luxury\u201d buyers, who consistently spend an average of \u20ac1,250, or about $1,560, a year on products such as perfume, fashion and fine jewelry.\u201cWe are in the midst of a generational shift,\u201d said Claudia d\u2019Arpizio, who specializes in luxury goods as a partner with Bain in Milan. \u201cToday\u2019s luxury consumers are a very diverse crowd, representing many different segments of people.\u201dThat crowd is only going to get larger and more heterogeneous \u2014 both geographically and demographically, analysts say. By the end of this decade, the global luxury consumer base will probably reach 400 million people, according to Bain, and climb to 500 million by 2030. Most of that growth will be fueled by steady economic growth in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, as well as the proliferation of digital and mobile technologies that enable consumers and brands to connect with one another in new and different ways. It is a development that has added enormous complexity to the customer relationship, but also creates competitive opportunities for brands that are prepared to adapt to this new landscape, luxury analysts say.\u201cThe population of high-net-worth individuals is going to expand globally,\u201d said Doug Gollan, editor of the magazine Elite Traveler. \u201cThe big question is, how deep into the pockets of these super-rich people are the luxury brands going to be able to get?\u201dThe key, Mr. Gollan and others say, may be in better harnessing the smartphones and other digital devices that are already nestled in these consumers\u2019 silk-lined pockets and crocodile handbags.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that access to big data from the Internet is reducing any gap in terms of education of consumers and information about luxury goods,\u201d Ms. d\u2019Arpizio said. In addition to creating new virtual \u201ctouch points\u201d for these affluent, hyper-connected consumers, analyzing the way people interact with apps and online stores can help educate brands about what she calls the \u201cdeep why\u201d \u2014 the emotional, rather than the rational, drivers of luxury purchases.\u201cTechnology and the Internet are enlarging the range of opportunities for creating a dialogue with customers,\u201d Ms. d\u2019Arpizio said.Worldwide, luxury consumers are increasingly emerging from a class that is accumulating wealth at a younger age than their parents or grandparents did. These consumers, now in their 30s and 40s, have grown up with the Internet and mobile technology and are accustomed to using digital tools and social networks to educate themselves about brands, which in turn allow brands to establish emotional connections with them.Ms. d\u2019Arpizio said such experiments showed that the fashion world already had learned a lot from technology and lifestyle brands about the transition taking shape in customers\u2019 expectations. For example, \u201cApple has taught a big lesson to the luxury industry,\u201d she said, \u201cmaking the industry understand that people want a different kind of relationship with brands.\u201dIt is these young consumers who will drive brands\u2019 revenue in coming years, predicted Hana Ben-Shabat, a partner who specializes in luxury retailing at A.T. Kearney, a global management consulting firm in New York. \u201cThe average luxury consumer is more connected than the mass-market consumer, and already purchases far more online\u201d in both volume and value terms, Ms. Ben-Shabat said. While they have significant disposable income, their busy work and travel schedules often leave limited time for shopping and reading about current fashion trends, which drives them to do more of their research and ordering online.E-commerce still represents a small fraction of luxury transactions \u2014 about 4.5 percent last year, according to a survey published by the Italian trade association Altagamma \u2014 but it is growing fast. By the end of this year, that figure is expected to climb to 7 percent, and Ms. d\u2019Arpizio said that by 2025 she expected that more than one-fifth of all luxury purchases would be take place online. By then, even most transactions that are concluded in a physical store will have been influenced by what people have experienced on a website, mobile app or through their social network.\u201cThat changes completely the rules of the game,\u201d she said.And not only will the proliferation of digital and mobile sales and marketing channels continue to transform customer behavior, it also will have a drastic effect on the life cycle of luxury brands.\u201cYou no longer need a long heritage to be credible,\u201d Ms. d\u2019Arpizio said. \u201cThe ability to become relevant now is not a question of years, but of months.\u201dThat will create an ever-more heated race among brands for the attention of luxury customers.\u201cThere are now hundreds of equally compelling brands, such that we have reached a situation of competitive congestion,\u201d said Robin Lewis, a former editor at Women\u2019s Wear Daily who is now a retailing and fashion industry consultant. \u201cIncreasingly, brands will need to figure out how to get out in front of the consumer ahead of their competitors.\u201dMs. Ben-Shabat said technology would be a key way for brands to reach customers on multiple platforms. \u201cYou can target and optimize your offering on an individual basis,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will be able to opt in or opt out as they find your content interesting.\u201dBut for all the advantages these new technologies are expected to bring, maintaining a customer\u2019s interest will remain a challenge for luxury brands.\u201cYou can speed up the process of becoming relevant, but you cannot reduce the complexity,\u201d Ms. d\u2019Arpizio said. \u201cYou have to work very hard to keep the momentum.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Mexico\u2019s President Must Do", "Date": "2014-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has shown remarkable leadership in passing key reforms to reanimate the economy and further the development of Mexico. But now he must act quickly to re-establish his political credibility and limit damage to his moral standing. The present crisis requires it.Thousands of young people have been marching in the streets of Mexico since the kidnapping and murder of 43 students (now confirmed by the DNA of a burned body) from a college in Ayotzinapa in the state of Guerrero. According to Mexico\u2019s attorney general, the crime was committed by professional killers working for a narco- gang and under the orders of the former mayor of the town of Iguala, who was a member of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Although most of these criminals, including the mayor and his wife, have been arrested, the student protesters are blaming the Pe\u00f1a Nieto government of the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and questioning its legitimacy. They are even demanding that the legally elected president resign from office.Although most Mexicans may not support so extreme a demand as resignation, the popularity level of the president has sunk quite low, and not only because of the slow response to this atrocious crime. The suspicion of a conflict of interest over his wife\u2019s partial purchase of a luxury mansion has further clouded the situation for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Distrustful of government and fed up with the violence and insecurity unleashed by the drug cartels, Mexicans feel a profound moral and political resentment at a situation that those of us who struggled for the coming of democracy at the turn of the millennium never expected to confront. While there have been incidents of violence among the protesters, most of the demonstrations have been peaceful but intensely angry. And their anger is justified.\u201cNo vale nada la vida, la vida no vale nada\u201d (Worth nothing is life, life is worth nothing) goes a famous Mexican song whose subject is macho boastfulness but whose words sadly reflect the deadly realities in my country. There have been about 100,000 deaths from criminal violence in this new millennium. In the state of Tamaulipas on the northeastern border, civil authority is almost nonexistent, and journalists, bloggers and even tweeters are routinely assassinated. In Guerrero, more than a dozen criminal gangs are operating, and mayors and local police often collaborate with them. In entire areas of the states of Michoac\u00e1n, Morelos and Mexico (a state adjacent to the capital), kidnappings, assaults and extortion are endemic. Ninety-eight percent of the crimes have gone unpunished. It is this near-total impunity that is the country\u2019s foremost problem.The violence recalls earlier periods of Mexican history, as during the war against bandits initiated by the dictator Porfirio D\u00edaz (who ruled from 1876-1911) and fought by a merciless mounted police force, the Rurales. It even reminds us of the Mexican Revolution itself, which left a long trail of blood until a new dictatorship was imposed by the PRI, founded in 1929. The long rule of the PRI became a source of corruption that led, in the final decades of the 20th century, to the enrichment of politicians with ties to major drug traffickers.Many of us believed that all this would disappear with the advent of democracy in 2000, when the PRI fell from power after 71 years. We were wrong. The sudden limitations put on the near-monarchical powers of the president had the positive effect of liberating legal local powers (governors and mayors), but it also gave new strength to illegal local powers (drug traffickers and organized crime operatives), who recognized and utilized the weakness of control within the new democratic state to expand their national influence.How can the violence and crime be driven back and defeated? The old means of dictatorship are not desirable \u2014 nor even thinkable. Freedom of expression, social networking and a solid belief in human rights won\u2019t allow it. Instead, the government must forge a political and social consensus to greatly strengthen the rule of law within the framework of our young and fragile democracy.But to do so, it must possess political and moral credibility \u2014 and at the moment it is precisely this credibility that is in question.To try to ease the crisis, President Pe\u00f1a Nieto has proposed a series of measures that would recentralize power. He wants to eliminate more than 1,800 local police forces (to be integrated into the police forces of our 32 states) and to legally remove municipal governments linked to organized crime. Some of these proposals point in the right direction, but much more is needed, especially a greater professionalization of all services connected with the rule of law, from criminal investigation to the courts and prisons.Right now the president must make changes in his cabinet, for example by removing the secretary responsible for the awarding of a lucrative high-speed rail contract that many of the president\u2019s critics claim was granted as a quid pro quo to the builder of the mansion that the first lady was buying as their home. Although she is now selling the property and the rail contract has been canceled, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto must acknowledge the shadows that have been cast over his administration by the appearance of scandal.This is perhaps the most difficult request I would make: that the president appear before the nation, recognize his errors and offer an apology to the people of Mexico. Nothing lends more nobility to a person in power than recognizing his own humanity. And no strategy of reforms, even the most rational, can replace the legitimacy of ethical leadership, especially in times of crisis. Incarnating such leadership should be Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s immediate priority.Leer en espa\u00f1ol (Read in Spanish) \u00bbAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aleksei Navalny, Putin Critic, Is Spared Prison in a Fraud Case, but His Brother Is Jailed", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Hours after being spared prison on Tuesday in a criminal fraud trial widely viewed as political revenge, the Kremlin\u2019s chief antagonist, Aleksei A. Navalny, broke out of house arrest and tried to join an unsanctioned antigovernment rally, daring the authorities to throw him in jail.They refrained, but in a twist that clearly caught Mr. Navalny, the normally unruffled political opposition leader off guard, the court ordered that his younger brother, Oleg, who was also charged in the fraud case, serve three and half years in prison.The jailing of the brother, a former postal worker generally viewed as a pawn in a larger battle, signaled that the Kremlin was adopting a heavy-handed strategy in seeking to suppress Mr. Navalny\u2019s political activities by sidelining him without transforming him into a martyr.\u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed?\" Mr. Navalny cried out in dismay at the young judge, Yelena Korobchenko, as she read the verdict.\u201cWhy are you jailing him?\u201d Mr. Navalny shouted, with tears in his eyes. \u201cThis is a dirty trick. To punish me more?\u201dSome analysts said that was precisely the goal.\u201cKremlin liberalism,\u201d Lilia Shevtsova, an expert on Russian domestic politics at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a post on Facebook. \u201cLet\u2019s put him on a long leash. We can always shorten it. And the brother gets a real sentence. This means that we take a family member hostage! And we can make his life in prison unbearable.\u201dA trenchant critic of Russia\u2019s rampant corruption, Mr. Navalny became a hero to the tens of thousands of Muscovites who took to the streets to protest vote rigging in parliamentary elections in 2011. Mr. Navalny, whose politics combine liberalism with an earthy nationalism, refused to back down when Vladimir V. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012 determined to suppress the incipient democracy movement and reduce individual and news media freedoms.Over the last two years, the government has harassed him, filing corruption charges in several cases, none of them justified, independent legal analysts said. But the Kremlin has been leery of treating him too harshly, wary of provoking a backlash.\u201cYou just asked about house arrest; well, house arrest is irrelevant in comparison with what is going on in our country,\u201d he said in a brief phone interview with the Echo of Moscow radio station as he walked along. \u201cIt\u2019s not about my brother, my family or myself, or any other concrete person. It\u2019s about the disgusting, mean things happening now, happening for years now, because we have just been sitting at home.\u201dHe was seized by the police outside the Ritz Carlton Hotel on Tverskaya Street, which he had just joked that his supporters should take by storm because it would be more comfortable than where he would probably spend the night. In the end, though, the authorities seemed equally determined to avoid further confrontation and returned him to his apartment, though they posted five officers outside the door.Not long after he was seized, the riot police moved in to disperse the rally on Manezh Square, where the crowd had dwindled to about 1,500. More than 200 people were arrested, but there were no reports of violence.The Kremlin\u2019s relatively cautious treatment of Mr. Navalny may have been reinforced lately by the country\u2019s mounting economic problems. Although the annexation of Crimea last spring pushed Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity to stratospheric heights, the ensuing Western sanctions and a simultaneous worldwide drop in oil prices have battered the Russian economy \u2014 and the fortunes of average Russians, whom the Kremlin is anxious not to antagonize.Larger economic and geopolitical concerns may have also factored into the decision to keep Mr. Navalny out of jail, to avoid yet another point of contention with the West.The suspended sentence will keep Mr. Navalny out of prison, but under Russian law, his felony conviction makes him ineligible to seek public office for 10 years after the sentence is completed. And even if he intended to make a swift return to the political arena, his actions would now be shadowed by fear of harm befalling his brother in prison.In a recent interview published in the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Oleg Navalny, who, like his brother, is married and has two young children, said he understood the risks of his brother\u2019s political activism.Aleksei A. Navalny rose to prominence as an anticorruption blogger with a special knack for turning a memorable phrase.\u201cWe absolutely knew that sooner or later this all would touch us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is easy to influence a person through his family.\u201dOutside the courtroom, several dozen supporters of Mr. Navalny said they believed that his brother\u2019s sentence was meant to punish him.\u201cSo they have taken him hostage,\u201d said Vera Kashtanova, a 70-year-old retiree huddled in a heavy fur coat against the morning frost.Ms. Kashtanova said that she had not joined in protests, either during the Soviet era or under Mr. Putin, until this year, after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.\u201cI am a Sovok,\u201d she said, using slang that means an old-fashioned Soviet person. \u201cBut I am an enlightened Sovok.\u201d\u201cWhat are we going to go out on the streets for?\u201d he asked in a recent interview. \u201cThere are no elections at all anymore. Talking about falsifications is absurd because none of us are allowed to run.\u201dFar from cowering, Mr. Navalny has publicly and repeatedly accused Mr. Putin and his closest associates in and out of the government of theft and corruption on a vast scale. More recently, he accused them of fomenting war in Ukraine to secure and expand power.He has also made no secret of his presidential ambitions. And though he has lived for years on the brink of lengthy imprisonment, he has shown no willingness to leave Russia the way other prominent critics of Mr. Putin have done in recent years.\u201cPutin supports Kadyrov\u2019s idea of punishing relatives,\u201d Mr. Gudkov said.Mr. Navalny\u2019s Twitter account, which has at times been managed by his wife or supporters after a court order prohibited him from using the Internet, featured a message after the ruling saying, \u201cOf all possible sentences, today\u2019s is the most vile.\u201dThe fraud case against Mr. Navalny that was decided Tuesday is just one of numerous criminal prosecutions that have been brought against him in recent years. All of them are generally regarded as a response by the authorities to his political activism.In a dramatic scene, he was sentenced to five years in prison and led from the courtroom in handcuffs, only to be released the next day by a judge who agreed to hear an appeal in the case.It was while free from prison in that case that Mr. Navalny ran for mayor of Moscow. He drew a surprisingly strong 27.2 percent of the vote despite facing overwhelming obstacles in standing against the Kremlin-backed incumbent, Sergei S. Sobyanin.In Kirov, the charges were considered baseless by many legal experts and had been thrown out after a local investigation. The case was resurrected by federal officials in Moscow, and the Kremlin made little effort to mask the political motivation of the prosecution.An article on Wednesday about the jailing of the brother of the prominent Russian dissident Aleksei A. Navalny, in what was seen as an effort by the Kremlin to silence Mr. Navalny, gave an outdated affiliation for Lilia Shevtsova, an expert on Russian politics. She is now with the Brookings Institution, no longer the Carnegie Moscow Center.Andrew Roth, Andrew Kramer and Alexandra Odynova contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Indefinitely Bans Drilling in Alaskan Bay", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Tuesday again used his executive authority to enact an environmental priority as he indefinitely barred oil and gas exploration of Alaska\u2019s picturesque Bristol Bay to protect some of the nation\u2019s most productive commercial fisheries.Mr. Obama first put the ecologically sensitive area of the Bering Sea \u2014 home to an important population of whales, seals and sea lions \u2014 off limits to oil rigs in 2010, but that restriction was set to expire in 2017, several months after he leaves office. With the new executive memorandum that he signed in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Obama made the ban permanent unless a future president acts to reverse it and allow leasing of the waters of the bay.Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, said she did not oppose the decision. \u201cGiven the lack of interest by industry and the public divide over allowing oil and gas exploration in this area, I am not objecting to this decision at this time,\u201d she said in a statement.But she added that \u201cit is incredibly frustrating that this administration looks at Alaska\u201d and \u201cdecides that conservation is our most pressing need,\u201d rather than supporting an oil-based economy threatened by plunging prices. \u201cWe are not asking to produce everywhere,\u201d she added, \u201cbut right now, we are not being allowed to produce anywhere.\u201dEnvironmentalists hailed the decision to ban offshore drilling in the area. \u201cThe president has shown wisdom and vision in protecting this amazing region of the world from drilling,\u201d said Peter Lehner, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.Bristol Bay is home to a variety of marine life, including beluga and killer whales and the endangered North Pacific right whale. It also hosts one of the largest runs of sockeye salmon in the world, supporting a $2-billion-a-year fishing industry that provides 40 percent of the wild-caught seafood in the United States, according to the White House.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Merkel to Attack Anti-Immigrant Movement in Germany", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will use her New Year\u2019s speech to make her most direct plea yet to Germans to stay away from the recent protests against a supposed \u201cIslamization\u201d of Europe. Ms. Merkel warned that the organizers of such protests often intended them to whip up hatred against nonwhites or non-Christians.Ms. Merkel has spoken on the issue before, saying that there is no place in Germany for prejudice and lies and warning citizens not to let themselves be used by the protest organizers.But her New Year\u2019s appeal is much clearer, and comes from someone who grew up in East Germany and can remember the Monday marches that helped topple the Berlin Wall in 1989.\u201cToday, some people are again shouting on Mondays, \u2018Wir sind das Volk!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Merkel says, according to the text of her remarks released by the government. \u201cBut what they really mean is, \u2018You don\u2019t belong, because of the color of your skin, or your religion.\u2019 That\u2019s why I say to all who go to such demonstrations: Don\u2019t follow those who call for this! Too often, there is prejudice, coldness or even hatred in their hearts.\u201dThe chancellor, 60, opens her remarks, recorded in advance for broadcast as 2014 melts into 2015 at midnight Wednesday, by noting that the year just passed would be remembered as one filled with events that one would not have predicted last New Year\u2019s, particularly Russia\u2019s challenge to the European order in Ukraine.\u201cThere is no question that we want security in Europe together with Russia, not against Russia,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there is also no question that Europe cannot and will not accept a supposed right of the mightier, which does not respect international law.\u201dEurope, she adds, has proved that it can resist attempts to divide the Continent and can act together with \u201cits trans-Atlantic partners.\u201d\u201cThis unity of Europe is not an end in itself, but it is the key to overcoming the crisis in Ukraine and applying the might of the law,\u201d Ms. Merkel says, according to the released text.She also defends immigration as \u201ca win for us all,\u201d bringing in workers whom the German economy, the largest in Europe, needs to thrive.Political circles in Berlin have been consumed by the debate over immigration and refugees since the Dresden protests began, and several prominent commentators have suggested that the government needs to do a better job of explaining its policies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congressional Roadblock Upends Market for Terrorism Insurance", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On Jan. 1, thanks to an unanticipated legislative roadblock as Congress adjourned, insurers will no longer be required to provide federally guaranteed financial protection from terrorist attacks.Then the cascade is expected to begin.Most existing terrorism insurance policies will turn into pumpkins, thanks to clauses that say those policies exist only because the federal government backed them. Many insurers will stop offering terrorism insurance at all. Some will continue, but at much higher rates. Planned developments will be mothballed; some risky public events might be canceled. The Super Bowl, however, will be played, the National Football League said Wednesday, contrary to the rumor mill.\u201cI am comfortable saying on Jan. 1, we will see a major market disruption,\u201d said Howard Mills, the chief adviser to Deloitte\u2019s insurance industry group and a former superintendent of the New York Insurance Department.Virtually no member of Congress \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 wanted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to lapse at the end of this year. The Senate had passed a revamped version in July, 93-4. The House passed a new compromise last Wednesday, 417-7. Then the bill died \u2014 over an objection by a single senator, in large part to a provision unrelated to the federal financial backstop for terrorism recovery.\u201cThis is taking people by surprise, quite frankly,\u201d said Robert P. Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute in New York. \u201cIt won\u2019t have an instantaneous effect, the economy grinding to a halt, cancellation of the Super Bowl. The effects will be more gradual, but in many ways more insidious.\u201d For the real estate industry, especially in places like New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas or anywhere that could be considered a terrorism target, the adjournment of the 113th Congress late Tuesday night left a changed world. Congress first wrote the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act in 2002 after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, froze construction and development. Suddenly, banks were demanding broad insurance against terrorism before they would finance any project, and private insurers were not about to write those policies.Congress stepped in, promising that the government would help recoup losses for terrorism destruction over $100 million. Without the federal statute, known as TRIA, Lower Manhattan would look nothing like it does today, real estate experts said on Wednesday. One World Trade Center, the shining new symbol of post-9/11 recovery, would not exist, since the Port Authority would not have built a tower that size if tenants could not insure their space. \u201cI can tell you the building I\u2019m in right now, 1 Bryant Park, would never have been built without TRIA,\u201d said Douglas Durst, one of the prime developers of Manhattan after 9/11. Private insurers might have provided some terrorism coverage for top dollar, but not nearly enough to ensure the financing of a $2.5 billion building.\u201cEverybody expected this would get done,\u201d he said, fuming. \u201cThese actions make it impossible to make investments in this country.\u201dSenator Tom Coburn, the Oklahoma Republican most responsible for the impasse that prevented the law\u2019s renewal, was unmoved by such lamentations.\u201cWhile many members of the industry will tout Chicken Little scenarios related to the temporary lapse of TRIA, it\u2019s important to temper these dire predictions with the fact that property/casualty has $600 billion in reserves \u2014 15 times the insurance losses related to 9/11,\u201d Mr. Coburn said in a statement, perhaps his last before he retires with the 113th Congress. \u201cTRIA is a flawed program that shifts most of the risk to the taxpayers, but keeps all of the profits with the insurers.\u201dSean McGovern, chief risk officer and general counsel of Lloyd\u2019s of London, the largest insurance market, said Mr. Coburn\u2019s statement was simply not true. Even for an insurance giant that prides itself on insuring things no others will, global terrorism is too big a threat for the private sector to handle on its own, he said. Virtually every developed economy has a government backstop to help insurers cover terrorism, he said. \u201cThe frustration is they had a bill that passed the House 417-7, 93-4 in Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare to have any bill get that level of support.\u201dMr. Coburn\u2019s statement aside, the collapse of terrorism coverage had nothing to do with the debate over whether it should exist. Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, had expressed misgiving about a federal role in the private insurance market, but after difficult negotiations, he and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the Democrats\u2019 main champion of the provision, compromised on a six-year extension that raised the damage threshold to $200 million before federal assistance kicked in.The problem came elsewhere. The Senate-passed bill included an unrelated provision creating a federal registry to license insurance agents and brokers, but at Mr. Coburn\u2019s insistence, that registry would expire in two years. The House took that so-called sunset provision out, and Mr. Coburn blocked the bill.Hensarling aides on Wednesday put the blame on Senate Democratic leaders, who they said could have waited Mr. Coburn out, even if it meant keeping the Senate in session almost to Christmas \u2014 and long after the House had adjourned.But Mr. Schumer said that was never going to happen.\u201cThe best way to deal with this lapse is to assure the markets immediately that we will pass TRIA right when we return,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, adding, \u201cThe chances of that happening are 95 percent.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Energy Agency Cuts Oil Demand Forecast, Adding to Pressure on Prices", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The downdraft in oil prices showed no sign of abating on Friday.The main international benchmark, Brent crude, fell about 3 percent to about $61.80 barrel, a five-year low. That dip came a day after the American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude, fell below the psychologically significant $60 a barrel level in the United States for the first time since 2009.For now, analysts say, there seems to be no safety net for oil prices.\u201cIn the very short term prices can go lower; the market is weighted to very bearish sentiment,\u201d Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based research firm, said Friday.European stocks fell on Friday, posting their biggest weekly loss since mid-2011 as energy stocks were hurt by the slide in oil prices. The broad Stoxx Europe 600 index lost 5.8 percent for the week. On Wall Street, stocks were lower around midday in New York.\u201cThis is a blood bath,\u201d said Pierre Martin, a trader at Saxo Bank. \u201cAfter such a negative week, there\u2019s not even a rebound into the close. The fact that oil can\u2019t find a floor is spooking market players.\u201dDespite the continued fall in prices since then, OPEC shows little sign of uniting to make production cuts. \"Why should we cut production?\u201d Ali Al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister, said Wednesday on the sidelines of a climate-change conference in Lima, Peru.A test of strength appears to be occurring among the Saudis and their equally prosperous Gulf allies, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and other producers like Venezuela and Iran, which can much less easily afford a long bout of low prices. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the U.A.E. have about $1.5 trillion in financial assets among them, which is \u201cplenty to meet their spending needs for the next few years,\u201d said Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in London.On the other hand, Venezuela, Nigeria and others are \u201cgoing to have to cut back on spending,\u201d said Ms. Ziemba. Already, Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister and main oil policy maker has said it may be necessary to call an emergency OPEC meeting if the price rout continues.The Saudis and their allies argue that to cut production now to raise prices would be to subsidize competitors like the companies extracting oil from shale in the United States, which are responsible for recent big additions to world oil supplies. The Saudis, whose costs for producing oil are low, are betting that low prices will lead to a shakeout of higher-cost producers like the shale companies. At the least, the Saudis appear to want all of OPEC to participate in any trims, analysts say.Various forecasters have been stoking market fears by issuing forecasts of a growing glut next year. OPEC sent a shudder through the markets Wednesday when it forecast that demand for its own crude would be well below the ceiling that it recently declined to lower.A trim of 230,000 barrels per day is minimal in a global market of about 93 million barrels per day. But the lower forecast, the fourth by the agency in the past five months, reinforced the sentiment that supply is likely to exceed demand substantially next year.The drop in oil prices is a blessing and curse for Europe, which is struggling to break free of the economic stagnation that has dogged the region since the global financial crisis.Olivier Jakob, an oil analyst at Petromatrix, in Zug, Switzerland, said that he had expected Brent prices to fall no lower than $60 a barrel, but that now it appeared that floor might be breached. Even if market momentum carries it below that $60 level for a time, he said, \u201cit would be difficult to sustain,\u201d because producers would take action, perhaps by cutting output, and some marginally profitable operations would be forced to shut down.For producing nations, the fall in oil prices is causing real pain, stressing government budgets and exacerbating internal tensions. Venezuela is the most exposed, Mr. Jakob said, as \u201cthe markets are already pricing in a default.\u201dRussia, heavily dependent on oil revenue for government spending and weighed down by Western sanctions over Ukraine, and Nigeria, where producing areas have a long history of ethnic unrest, are also feeling the strain, he said. The ruble fell about 2 percent against the dollar on Friday, to trade at 57.58 rubles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Employers Will Have to Raise Wages. They Just Don\u2019t Know It Yet.", "Date": "2014-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnfreezing HiringAmerican employers are the equivalent of a shopkeeper who has a \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d sign permanently on display in his window, but never actually hires anybody. None of the applicants who come in offer the perfect mix of skills, experience and willingness to accept low pay that the shopkeeper is looking for.That\u2019s one way of reading some key measures of the labor market, updated Tuesday, that shed light on what afflicts the economy and where things will go from here.According to the latest Labor Department data, employers had 4.8 million positions they were looking to fill in October. That\u2019s up 25 percent in the last year and 125 percent since the start of the economic expansion in mid-2009.But for all these vacancies, actual hiring isn\u2019t in a similar boom. The number of people hired is up only 12 percent in the last year and 33 percent over the five-year expansion.Or to look at the same numbers a little differently, the ratio of job openings to actual hiring has been higher in the last few months than it has been at any other time in the history of the data (though that only goes back to 2001).You would expect for that ratio to skyrocket most when the economy and labor market are strong. Employers might have a harder time finding workers at a time of low joblessness, and thus have more unfilled openings. Yet that ratio is higher now than it was in 2006, the strongest year of the last expansion, when the unemployment rate averaged 4.6 percent. It is currently 5.8 percent.On the surface, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. The jobless rate doesn\u2019t even count millions of people who have left the labor force entirely in recent years and might be coaxed back in. So any employer with a job opening should have no problem hiring. If anything, the ratio of openings to hiring should be lower than it was in the mid-2000s, not higher.Here\u2019s a theory to try to make sense of the disconnect: During the recession, employers got spoiled. When unemployment was near 10 percent, talented workers were lined up outside their door. The workers they did have were terrified of losing their jobs. If you put out word that you had an opening, you could fill the job almost instantly. That\u2019s why the ratio of job openings to hires fell so low in 2009.As the economy has gotten better the last five years, employers have had more and more job openings, but have been sorely reluctant to accept that it\u2019s not 2009 anymore in terms of what workers they can hire and at what wage.Yes, unemployment is still elevated, but workers aren\u2019t in nearly as desperate a position as they were then. So to get the kind of talented people they want, employers are going to have to pay more (or offer better benefits or working conditions) than they would have not that long ago.In effect, there is a standoff between Corporate America and America\u2019s workers. Businesses see demand for their products and want to expand. After years of stagnant wages, workers aren\u2019t prepared to accept these jobs on the terms they are being offered.Eventually some employers will decide that they are leaving too much business on the table by not offering the pay and benefits and training that will fill their vacant openings. If that happens on a wide enough scale, it will mean that the long-awaited gains in wages for ordinary workers will finally start to arrive.All this is fragmentary evidence, and after years of stagnant wages, we\u2019ll need a lot more solid proof that something has changed before proclaiming a wage boom has arrived. But in this standoff between businesses that want high-skilled workers for minimal pay and workers who want to see raises, one side has to give.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unsteady Incomes Keep Millions Behind on Bills", "Date": "2014-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALEXANDRIA, Ky. \u2014 The bills arrive as regularly as a heartbeat at the Vories\u2019s cozy bi-level brick house just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati. It\u2019s the paychecks that are irregular.These days, Alex Vories, 37, is delivering pizzas for LaRosa\u2019s, though he has to use his parents\u2019 car since he wrecked his own 1997 Nissan van on a rainy day last month. In the spring and autumn, he had managed to snag several weeks of seasonal work with the Internal Revenue Service, sorting tax returns for $14 an hour. But otherwise the family had to make do with the $350 a week his wife, Erica, brought home from her job as a mail clerk for the I.R.S.\u201cWe just kind of wing it every month,\u201d said Mr. Vories, whose unemployment benefits ran out at the end of 2013, 10 months after he lost his job answering phones at Fidelity Investments. Ever since, the family\u2019s income has bounced up and down from one week to the next, like the basketball he and his two sons play with in their driveway, next to the Kentucky Wildcats pennant planted in their front yard.\u201cGet all the bills paid,\u201d he said, \u201cthen see where we\u2019re at.\u201dThe financial volatility that the Vories grapple with is a feature of life for millions of workers whose paychecks fluctuate with the season, an hourly schedule or the size of a weekly commission.Income variability is difficult to quantify, but studies that try to measure it suggest that ups and downs in income, particularly among the poorest 10 percent of American families, started to rise in the 1970s, leveled off in the early 2000s and then increased significantly again when the recession started.In the diaries\u2019 research, nearly all of the 235 households studied experienced a drop in monthly income of at least 25 percent in a single year. The main culprits were reduced work hours, health problems and shifts in household size, like a needy relative coming to stay.That strain explains why more than three-quarters of those surveyed said financial stability was more important than moving up the income ladder.\u201cWhen you have that extra, you tend to spend more,\u201d said Christine Chavez, a 27-year-old single mother who works for a collection agency in Bakersfield, Calif. \u201cAnd when the next month comes, that extra isn\u2019t there.\u201dSuch insecurity sabotages the most diligent efforts to budget and save for the future and is a pressing issue for many families here in the Kentucky suburbs stretching south from Cincinnati, where corporations like Toyota, Procter & Gamble, General Electric, DHL and Fidelity run a lot of back-office operations. Amazon has seven distribution sites. EBay recently opened a fulfillment center in nearby Walton, and hired about 2,000 seasonal workers at $12 an hour.Of the more than 6,800 households that sought emergency help from Brighton last year, 71 percent had worked at some time during the year, Ms. Frye explained on a recent morning. Tables in the lobby were piled high with boxes of pizza donated by Little Caesars, and a neat pantry down the hall was stocked with jars of peanut butter, boxes of macaroni and cheese, cans of tuna fish and a freezer full of meat.\u201cThey work hard,\u201d Ms. Frye said, \u201cand they still come up short.\u201dAlex Vories with his elder son, Caleb, at their Alexandria, Ky., home. The Vories family has struggled to pay the bills since he was laid off in February 2013 and his unemployment benefits ended 10 months later.Here in northern Kentucky, the Vories not only turned to the Brighton Center for food, they also applied for federal mortgage assistance, timed payments to grace periods, borrowed from family and relied on their church and friends.They reluctantly cashed in Mr. Vories\u2019 401(k) retirement account, absorbing the 10 percent penalty in return for a much-needed $4,500. And they borrowed a total of $2,500 from their bank at a 10 percent interest rate.\u201cYou think, \u2018How can you afford that?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Vories said, \u201cbut because it\u2019s getting our bills paid, you do.\u201dNone of that was necessary when Mr. Vories was steadily earning $425 a week. Fidelity matched his weekly 401(k) contributions and offered good health insurance that covered most of the medical bills from 9-year-old Caleb\u2019s severe ADHD and 6-year-old Josh\u2019s mild autism.They could afford the occasional night out with dinner and a movie. He was a few months away from the seven-year mark and a bump up in pay and vacation days, when he lost his job in February 2013.Over the next 10 months, Mr. Vories said he applied for 75 jobs. Nothing.Last December, he received a letter promising a three-month extension of his unemployment insurance, so he and Erica bought Christmas presents for the boys, a little Fender guitar for Caleb, and a drum set for Josh. But then congressional Republicans and Democrats deadlocked and no extended benefits were approved.The take home pay for Ms. Vories, 34, took a hit because she had to buy health insurance for the family. She signed up for a higher-paying night shift from 10 p.m. to 6:30 a.m., hoping to make up for the unexpected loss of her husband\u2019s unemployment insurance check. Despite the extra $250 a month, she had to stop after five months.\u201cYou\u2019re basically a zombie,\u201d Ms. Vories said. \u201cI saw the boys basically on Saturday, and you\u2019re just playing catch-up.\u201dThey reduced their church contributions. During the winter, they turned the heat down to 64 degrees. \u201cWe had one little space heater, and we would take it to whatever room we were in,\u201d Mr. Vories said.Still, the bills piled up. \u201cWe would get one week behind, then we would get two weeks behind, then three weeks behind,\u201d Mr. Vories said.They kept the house, but didn\u2019t have enough money to fix the central air-conditioning that quit right before the temperature shot past 90 degrees. They closed off the family room downstairs because of the sweltering heat. Parishioners at their church lent them a couple of window units.A few weeks later, the Vories\u2019s 2002 Toyota Corolla quit on their way back from a church tent revival meeting. With only one car, Ms. Vories had to stop working the early shift, which had allowed her to be home in time to meet the school bus. Mr. Vories\u2019s mother pitched in to babysit.In September, Mr. Vories stopped by LaRosa\u2019s pizzeria, where he got his first job at 15, washing dishes after school. He was overjoyed to hear they needed a delivery driver.But then in mid-October, as they we were driving home from visiting family, their Nissan van was totaled in a car accident. It was a heartbreak, because they had just poured in more than $1,000, given by Ms. Vories\u2019s parents, in repairs.\u201cIt just feels like money down the drain,\u201d Mr. Vories said, shaking his head.Proud of an above-average evaluation at the I.R.S., Mr. Vories said he was hopeful he would be rehired after the new year for seasonal work, which could ultimately turn into a full-time job.In the meantime, Mr. Vories is delivering pizzas, using his parents\u2019 Mercury Grand Marquis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Democracy Is Failing", "Date": "2014-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersRe \u201cDemocracy in deficit\u201d (Turning Points, Dec. 6): Former Prime Minister Tony Blair raises an interesting question: What is the relationship between economic growth and democracy? Mr. Blair sees the dearth of economic growth as evidence that something is wrong with 21st-century democracies. This strikes me as putting the cart before the horse. For 50 years or more, we have acted as if growth is a kind of heaven on earth that we must always pursue without question. We should at least have a conversation about what kinds of growth we want. At present, what little economic growth we get is creating a vastly more unequal world, as finance and banking grow larger in relation to the rest of the economy. In the United States, democracy is directly threatened by this increasing inequality, as billionaires in finance and oil exert disproportionate influence on the government and judiciary. Inequality is the greatest present threat to democracy, it is the cause of the increasing polarization, and it is destroying people\u2019s trust in democratic institutions. Mr. Blair equates democracy with economic growth. But democracy isn\u2019t an economic system; it is a system of self-governance. And it has been infiltrated and taken over by capitalism. In our capitalistic democracy, some votes are worth more than others. If we want democracy to be relevant, we must strive for a more perfect union of people acting together for common causes, not a union of corporate interests and endless economic growth at the expense of the people. Mr. Blair neglects to mention the main reason why democracy is almost dead. In the United States, it really does not matter who you vote for, or if you vote at all. The rich (like Mr. Blair) and powerful determine what the \u201celected\u201d Congress will do anyway. For democracy to work, the effect of money on the election process must be eliminated.There are many causes for democracy\u2019s problems, but we can forgive a politician for overlooking the most glaring one of all: Far too much time is spent on running for public office. A solution could be one-shot term limits, with longer terms of say nine years, so that on-the-job training can be put to use. Instead of being governed by fund-raisers, we could be governed by representatives, senators and presidents.Re \u201cWar on surveillance\u201d (Turning Points, Dec. 6): Julian Assange\u2019s article on the Orwellian side of the Internet is provocative. But the remedy for electronic tyranny \u2014 encryption \u2014 fails to take into account modern terrorism. The encryption that would justifiably limit official snooping would equally frustrate the equally justifiable attempt to short-circuit terrorist plots. One could argue about the relative importance of the two imperatives, but not about the two-faced character of all aspects of Internet surveillance.Re \u201cBhopal\u2019s deadly legacy\u201d (Dec. 5): I applaud your editorial on the gas leak 30 years ago from a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, that killed and maimed thousands of people. The accident was a shocking example of Union Carbide\u2019s gross negligence and abdication of corporate social responsibility, aggravated by the Indian government\u2019s passivity in holding the company accountable. As a naturalized American citizen from India, the tragedy affected me on a personal level. One of my close friends who happened to be there was a lucky survivor, though he suffered from debilitating health problems from gas inhalation that cut his life short at a young age.Appallingly, the people of Bhopal have been used as pawns in the political maneuvers of the Indian government. The payment of $470 million as compensation brokered by the government was a slap in the face of those who died and those who survived, and a pittance in comparison to American liability standards. To make matters worse, Dow Chemical took over Union Carbide in 2001 and declined to take any responsibility for Union Carbide\u2019s actions.President Obama will visit India in January for Republic Day celebrations and to strengthen business and diplomatic relationships. He and Prime Minister Narendra Modi can work together to clean up Bhopal\u2019s lingering toxic contamination by pressing Dow Chemical to help alleviate the suffering that has gone on for three decades now.Re \u201cThe disintegration of rural China\u201d (Review, Nov. 29) by Joe Zhang: Over the past 35 years, China has lifted 400 million people out of poverty. Despite a rise in crime, China is still one of the safest countries in the world. China\u2019s divorce rate, while climbing, is still low compared with the United States. It would be helpful to compare Mr. Zhang\u2019s own life with his father\u2019s to see how much progress his village has made. For me, it was a difference of night and day when I compared my own village in 2001 with how it was in 1979. Every village or society has its problems. The question is: Are these normal or abnormal problems associated with the development of a village or a country? As with the urbanization and development of any country, people in cities tend to benefit before farmers. More than 50 percent of China\u2019s people live in cities, compared with about 20 percent in 1980. So it is natural for cities to get more resources compared with villages.Mr. Zhang mentioned \u201celection fraud\u201d but failed to stress that there are actually \u201celections\u201d for village officers, which was unheard of before in China.

{"Headline": "For Obama, a Go-It-Alone Push Fits the Times", "Date": "2014-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 To the surprise of both allies and adversaries, President Obama has declined to humble himself following another midterm election bludgeoning.To the contrary, his recent immigration action made clear his determination to focus tenaciously on his governing objectives, without hiding his derision for Congress. His abandon might even have affronted the Barack Obama of 2008, who ran for president against a political system \u201cthat\u2019s divided us for too long.\u201dMr. Obama has long since concluded that pursuing dreams of reconciliation in his final two years in office is a fool\u2019s chase. So he is offering an alternative model for 21st-century presidential success.It does not hinge on job approval ratings. As Mr. Obama\u2019s weak poll numbers make clear, he has failed to unite the country.His current approach does not depend on bipartisan deal making or good cheer. The president has failed to win over congressional Republicans.It turns, instead, on advancing the major policy goals that Mr. Obama embraced as a candidate. Through that prism, he continues to make progress.Neither executive move accomplished as much as Mr. Obama could have through legislation, but may have been the only realistic routes forward that a polarized political system allowed him.George C. Edwards III, a Texas A&M professor who edits Presidential Studies Quarterly, wrote last year that critics of Washington dysfunction \u201ctake their frustrations out on the president, declaring that he should more effectively move the public and Congress to support his initiatives. There is little prospect for success in these endeavors, however.\u201dPresidents, Mr. Edwards noted, \u201ccannot create opportunities for change. Instead, effective presidents recognize and exploit opportunities that exist in their environments.\u201dMr. Edwards\u2019s view rests on his conclusion, after poring over data since the advent of political polling, that the persuasive power of the bully pulpit has always been \u201ca myth.\u201d Public approval tends to drift away from any president\u2019s views over time.Lacking the power to shift public opinion, presidents hold scant leverage over members of Congress not already inclined to support them, Mr. Edwards said in an interview. Moreover, they now have fewer means of persuasion.When President Lyndon Johnson pursued the Great Society, he could woo moderate Republicans on the basis of ideology and conservative Democrats in the name of partisan unity. In today\u2019s polarized system, lawmakers have grown increasingly uniform in opposition to a president from the other major party. And levers that had been used to broker compromise, like pending earmarks for pet projects, have mostly been eliminated.From the outset of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, Mr. Edwards argued, aspirations for a post-partisan transformation in Washington were unattainable. But he says Mr. Obama\u2019s advancement of key domestic and foreign policy goals \u201cmakes him a consequential president\u201d \u2014 for good or ill.Given partisan and ideological divisions, roughly half the country would almost invariably choose \u201cill.\u201d The last president to muffle the trend toward increasing polarization was George Bush. Not coincidentally, he failed to win re-election.Since then, assessments of the Oval Office occupant have grown increasingly divided by partisan affiliation. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last month, 77 percent of Democrats approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s job performance; only 8 percent of Republicans did.This landscape, except in extreme circumstances, does not offer the emotional balm of consensus about a president\u2019s performance.Unilateral White House action, even if it furthers a president\u2019s goals, cannot provide as durable a basis for national policy as law enacted with at least some support from both Republicans and Democrats. That is one reason the president\u2019s health care law, which passed with only Democratic votes, remains unpopular.Mr. Galston, once Mr. Clinton\u2019s top domestic policy adviser, faults Mr. Obama for not courting Republicans as effectively as Mr. Clinton did. That did not stop House Republicans from impeaching him.And the affable Mr. Bush, who left his mark by cutting taxes and going to war after Sept. 11, 2001, did not get far with his pledge to be \u201ca uniter not a divider\u201d in Washington.\u201cThat\u2019s not the way politics works in America,\u201d Mr. Edwards said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Braces for Economic Fallout as Greece Heads to Early Elections", "Date": "2014-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenior European Union officials immediately urged Greek voters \u2014 now headed to the polls on Jan. 25 \u2014 to focus on continuing the policies that have enabled the country to ride out its previous monetary crisis and remain part of the eurozone, and that have begun to restore the country\u2019s battered reputation for fiscal management.But with household incomes down by a third from what they were before the policies were adopted, and unemployment higher than 25 percent, polls have indicated support for Syriza, a leftist party that opposes the deep budget cuts Greece has made in recent years as a condition of financial bailouts.Syriza has said it wants to renegotiate the two bailouts, worth 240 billion euros, or about $292 billion, obtained from Greek\u2019s so-called troika of lenders \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 since 2010, and get its creditors to write off some of Greece\u2019s crippling debts.European leaders immediately began to warn of the possible consequences of a shift in Greek policies. The European Union\u2019s economic commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, warned that a \u201cstrong commitment to Europe and broad support among the Greek voters and political leaders for the necessary growth-friendly reform process will be essential for Greece to thrive again within the euro area.\u201dAnd a top German official warned that continued European aid would be conditional on Greece\u2019s continuing to make major cuts in public services and other changes to control spending.\u201cWe will continue to help Greece to help itself on its path of reforms,\u201d Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, said in a statement. But he added, \u201cIf Greece embarks on a different path, it could be difficult.\u201dThe possibility of a new confrontation over the policies of the last decade was set off by Parliament\u2019s failure on Monday to elect a new president in a third and final round of voting.Mr. Samaras said he would visit the current president, Karolos Papoulias, on Tuesday and ask him to dissolve Parliament immediately so that an early general election could be held on Jan. 25.\u201cThe country has no time to lose,\u201d Mr. Samaras said. \u201cWe did what we could to elect a president and avert early elections and the dangers they entail. Now, what Parliament failed to do, the people must do.\u201dThe development inspired jubilation among Syriza\u2019s members. After the vote, Alexis Tsipras, the party leader, called it \u201ca historic day for Greek democracy.\u201d\u201cGreek M.P.s showed that democracy cannot be blackmailed, however much pressure is exerted,\u201d he said. \u201cToday the government of Mr. Samaras, which has looted society for the past two and a half years, belongs to the past.\u201dOpinion polls show the leftists firmly ahead of Mr. Samaras\u2019s conservative New Democracy party, although Syriza\u2019s lead has narrowed in recent weeks with growing concerns about protracted political and financial uncertainty.The prospect of more upheaval in Greece and thus in the eurozone has loomed for several weeks, but politicians and markets alike have kept most fears to themselves. The worries are likely to resurface strongly once the New Year\u2019s holiday is over, exacerbating other continental differences over economic policy.Most notably, the European Central Bank faces a dilemma of whether to do more to stimulate Europe\u2019s wilting economy at the same time as bracing for more trouble for the euro.The election outcome battered financial markets in Greece, though the worst of the damage faded as the day wore on. Stocks plunged more than 10 percent on the Athens bourse after the vote, but regained more than half of the lost ground in late trading. The yield on the 10-year government bond, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, spiked nearly one full point to 9.3 percent as investors sold off.But, in keeping with predictions that the eurozone was better equipped to handle Greek turmoil than it was at the start of the currency crisis, there was little impact on the broader market. Both the Euro Stoxx 50 blue-chip index and the euro ended the day almost unchanged.Still, larger ripples may yet be felt in some of the bigger states using the euro if Greece radically alters the policies that have largely been favored by the more prosperous north.\u201cIn this period we believe the euro\u2019s second and third largest members \u2014 France and Italy \u2014 will be the most vulnerable to contagion, rather than Greece\u2019s neighbors in the southern periphery,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the director for Europe for Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, wrote in a research note on Monday. France and Italy, wrote Mr. Rahman, \u201chave done the least in terms of reform since the days of the debt crisis and therefore remain the most vulnerable economically.\u201dOn the other hand, he wrote, Portugal and Ireland \u201clook stronger as a result\u201d of thoroughgoing reforms and were benefiting economically from lower oil prices and the depreciation in the value of the euro.The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a center-right daily, summed up what is likely to be a widespread feeling among politicians in Berlin and bankers in Frankfurt.\u201cIs all that going to start up again?\u201d said the headline on a commentary by the newspaper\u2019s foreign editor, Klaus-Dieter Frankenberger.Greece had seemed to be on a hopeful, if difficult, road to recovery, Mr. Frankenberger said, and \u201cright at the turn of the year, we could have done without this.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the surname of the Greek prime minister.

{"Headline": "Auto Sales Inch Higher in Europe", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 European car sales rose modestly in November, industry data showed on Tuesday, with manufacturers\u2019 incentives helping to maintain a rising trend despite weakness in France and Germany.Sales in Germany, the largest market in the European Union, fell 1.8 percent, and French sales fell 2.7 percent. But Britain, Italy and Spain showed increases, helping to maintain overall growth in the region.Tim Urquhart, an auto analyst with IHS Global Insight in London, said that since the global crisis, individuals and companies had been putting off vehicle purchases, \u201cbut that\u2019s sort of coming to an end now.\u201dDemand for new cars to replace aging models, he said, \u201cis pushing people back on the market, a very competitive one where there are tons of deals to chose from.\u201dStill, the market remains far weaker than it was before the 2008 financial crisis, he said.\u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re seeing a slow, steady but fragile recovery,\u201d he said.For the year through November, sales came in at 11.6 million units, the association said, leaving the industry on pace for a 2014 total well below the market peak, in 2007, when nearly 16 million passenger cars were sold.Spain led European sales in November, with a 17.4 percent gain from a year earlier, helped by trade-in incentives from the government. Sales in Britain rose 8 percent, lifted by easier credit and a relatively strong economy. Sales in Italy rose 5 percent.Sales by Volkswagen Group, the largest European carmaker, rose 2.6 percent compared with the period in 2013, led by a 10.3 percent rise in sales of its budget brand, SEAT.PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, the second-largest European automaker, posted a decline of 3.1 percent. Sales at Renault, the French company that ranks as No.\u20093 in Europe, rose 3.9 percent from a year earlier, lifted by sales of its low-cost Dacia brand.BMW\u2019s sales gained 9.7 percent, helped by strong performance across its business, including from its new five-door Mini. Daimler\u2019s sales rose 4 percent.American automakers continued to struggle in the region.

Lukashevich, said in a statement that was variously scornful and scolding. \u201cWell, we will wait.\u201d Calling those measures \u201ccollective punishment,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said they amounted to an acknowledgment that the decision to secede from Ukraine was \u201cunanimous and voluntary.\u201d Russian anger over Western sanctions has intensified in recent days as the country\u2019s economy has gone into a tailspin. A sharp decline in oil prices, combined with pressure from sanctions and an erratic response in recent months by the Russian Central Bank led to a precipitous decline in the ruble.Separately, the Kremlin on Saturday released the text of a congratulatory message from Mr. Putin to employees and veterans of Russia\u2019s security services to mark a holiday celebrating their service to the country.In the message, Mr. Putin noted that emerging threats required constant modernization of the security apparatus.\u201cNew destabilizing factors require greater efficiency of the entire national security system,\u201d Mr. Putin wrote, adding that the chief responsibilities were \u201cstrong and resolute resistance to international terrorism and extremism, to any attempts by foreign special services to deal a blow to Russia, to its political and economic interests.\u201dThe latest sanctions include an order by the Obama administration prohibiting American companies from doing business in Crimea, including a ban on imports and exports, real estate purchases and the financing of businesses there. The European Union, meanwhile, banned travel businesses from operating in Crimea, a popular tourist destination because of its beautiful beaches along the Black Sea. The dual statements by Russia criticizing the West were issued on Saturday as a disagreement persisted over resuming negotiations aimed at resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. International mediators have been eager to restart talks, which were initially held in September in Minsk, Belarus, but met with minimal success. Participants in the talks, including Ukraine, Russia and separatist leaders from eastern Ukraine, have been unable to agree on a date and location to meet. Meanwhile, Russia has announced that it will send yet another convoy carrying humanitarian aid to the war zone on Sunday, highlighting Ukraine\u2019s continuing lack of control over its eastern border. Russia has insisted that all of its previous convoys carried only humanitarian aid, but the porous border has also clearly allowed a flow of fighters and weapons to reinforce separatist rebels in the east. Russia\u2019s statements on Saturday veered from scolding the West for imposing sanctions that it said history had demonstrated would fail, to boasting about the ability of the Russian people to persevere against adversaries. \u201cFor those who still are under the illusion that everyone in the world should live as specified by Washington and Ottawa,\u201d Mr. Lukashevich, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said, \u201cRemember: Crimea is a primordial and integral part of Russia.

{"Headline": "Fed Official Warns of Risk From Hasty Rate Increase ", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said on Friday that the Fed\u2019s latest steps toward raising interest rates increased an \u201cunacceptable\u201d risk that the economy would fall into an enduring period of low inflation.Mr. Kocherlakota, who voted against the measures that the central bank announced on Wednesday, said in an interview that the Fed was taking an unnecessary gamble. He reiterated his view that the Fed should declare an intention to keep the crucial interest rate lever it controls near zero until the inflation outlook improves.But he said that he saw little chance of winning the debate and that he hoped he would not be vindicated by events.\u201cYou know, what I hope does not happen is that the evolution of the data makes them come around,\u201d Mr. Kocherlakota said. \u201cI hope they\u2019re proven right. I think there\u2019s a risk here being taken by the committee, and for the good of the economy, I hope it turns out well for them.\u201dWhile low inflation may sound like a good thing, Fed officials generally agree that annual inflation of about 2 percent has important economic benefits.It strengthens the Fed\u2019s ability to counteract economic downturns by providing room to reduce borrowing costs when needed. It also helps the economy to rebound by allowing nominal cuts in wages and prices, which are easier to impose than real cuts.The Fed\u2019s plans are based on its expectation that inflation will begin to rebound in 2016 as the job market tightens and the economy continues to advance at a healthy pace. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a member of the majority led by Janet L. Yellen, the fed chairwoman, said in an interview on Friday with Bloomberg Radio that there was \u201cno question\u201d that the Fed would start raising rates before inflation reached 2 percent.Two other officials also voted against the Fed\u2019s decision, although for the opposite reason. They argued that the Fed was not moving fast enough. Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, both expressed concern that the Fed was underestimating the strength of the economic recovery and that it would need to raise rates more quickly.Mr. Fisher did not elaborate on his reasons for dissent on Friday, after the Fed ended a post-meeting quiet period.Such a high level of dissent is unusual \u2014 before 2011, it last happened in 1992 \u2014 because the Fed aims to set policy by consensus. It tries to shape expectations about its future conduct, and dissents tend to undermine confidence that the Fed will follow through.Mr. Kocherlakota noted that inflation had run below the Fed\u2019s target in each of the last 30 months, that the Fed\u2019s staff forecast inflation would remain below the Fed\u2019s target for the next few years and that some measures of investors\u2019 inflation expectations had fallen sharply.\u201cWe chose 2 percent for a good reason, and that was to provide enough capacity to help buffer the economy against shocks,\u201d Mr. Kocherlakota said. \u201cIf the inflation rate gets stuck at a low level, then we lose our ability to buffer against shocks.\u201dAnd as Japan has discovered, once inflation sags, it can be hard to revive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Save Russia\u2019s Punch Line of a Car", "Date": "2014-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOGLIATTI, Russia \u2014 Ladas are the family cars that Russians love to hate.Loathed as outmoded rattletraps, they have long inspired more punch lines than passion: How many people does it take to drive a Lada? Four; one to steer and three to push.Conversely, Russians cherish Ladas as the last major Soviet car brand still produced from scratch. Of the estimated 40 million cars in Russia, more than one-third are Ladas, and the Granta, a small sedan, outsells every other car.Yet they are endangered. The company\u2019s market share diminished steadily after the Soviet Union collapsed, dropping to 17 percent from 70 percent. Long before the recent oil price collapse pummeled Russia\u2019s economy, the Kremlin decided Lada needed rescuing.It recruited Bo Inge Andersson, a blunt Swedish-American executive with long experience in Detroit, to overhaul Avtovaz, Lada\u2019s corporate parent and a signature Russian industrial company.\u201cThe biggest focus for us is to bring back the pride in Lada,\u201d Mr. Andersson, 59, said during what seemed like a speed-walking race here through one of the world\u2019s largest auto plants.President Vladimir V. Putin has repeatedly said this month that Western sanctions mean Russia has to go it alone. So resurrecting Avtovaz is a parable for changes needed by all Russian manufacturing. It is not quite \u201cAs Avtovaz goes, so goes the nation,\u201d but close.\u201cIt is a problem that the entire country faces,\u201d said Aleksey Y. Buzinny, deputy mayor of Togliatti, a city of 719,000 that earns one-quarter of its taxes via the factory. \u201cWe are very good at selling raw materials; we are not so good at producing and selling quality finished goods. We grew a little too complacent when oil and gas prices soared, why care about anything else?\u201dAfter Mr. Andersson arrived last January, Togliatti, the most famous Russian car town, lauded his hands-on approach. A former army major, he inspected the factory toilets. He dressed managers in gray \u201cAndersson jackets,\u201d meant to inspire teamwork. He introduced himself to workers.He pioneered novel concepts like customer service. A dealer survey found the standard response to complaints had long been, \u201cWhat do you expect, it\u2019s a Lada?\u201d Mr. Andersson said. He hired a company to scan social media for negative comments and the new customer service department responded.\u201cHe is a tough guy, but quite open,\u201d said Yuri K. Tselikov, 74, a retired Avtovaz worker and local gadfly. \u201cHe fought for cleanliness everywhere.\u201dGrudging respect soured into resentment after Mr. Andersson cut 20 percent of the work force \u2014 about 13,400 jobs \u2014 revamped manufacturing methods and initiated a showdown with Russian parts suppliers that interrupted production. His methods generated suspicion. \u201cHe wants to gradually squeeze Lada out of the market,\u201d Mr. Tselikov said.Mr. Andersson also eliminated the automatic annual raise, instead trying to combat chronic, 10 percent absenteeism by awarding an extra month\u2019s pay to the 4,397 workers with perfect attendance.\u201cTogliatti seems to be the last piece of Russia that is still a piece of the Soviet Union,\u201d he said, noting repeatedly that the concept of profit and loss was alien. The first Lada, built in 1970, was a joint venture with Fiat \u2014 an even more spartan version of the bare-bones Fiat 124. Russia named the town after Palmiro Togliatti, the longtime Italian Communist Party leader.Residents are still discussing web reports published months ago that listed Mr. Andersson\u2019s salary among the highest in Russia at $10 million in rubles annually. That is a yawning gap with the average 26,000 rubles or $441 workers earn each month. (The ruble has lost some 45 percent of its value against the dollar this year.)Mr. Andersson did not want his salary published. But he shared one paycheck stub that showed far less than the reported amount and was certainly modest by Detroit standards. His contract\u2019s profit-sharing clause, however, could bring a significant payout, he said.Some in Togliatti now deride him as a carpetbagger, an undertaker and \u201cHans Christian Andersen,\u201d the Danish spinner of fairy tales.Mr. Andersson monitors the criticism, but said that the government, including President Putin in person, endorsed his plan. The town fathers, the official union and some workers support him as well. He also has two bodyguards.This is not the first effort to fundamentally alter Lada. The previous attempt, after the 2008 financial crisis, ended the Soviet-era, cradle-to-grave welfare system whereby the factory staffed hospitals and schools and provided apartments. Street protests halted any further cutbacks \u2014 the Kremlin evidently fearful about unrest spreading elsewhere.Piotr A. Zolotaryov, head of a 300-member independent union, called the current tension a classic worker-management dispute over job security and wages. Many also resent that Mr. Andersson is foreign, he acknowledged in an interview at the union offices.Russians tend to recall every historical slight, and on cue a union member nearby groused, \u201cHe seeks to avenge the Battle of Poltava!\u201d \u2014 when Russian forces crushed an attempt by King Charles XII of Sweden to conquer Moscow in 1709.Street demonstrations this time fizzled. Given the economy, people are worried about survival, Mr. Zolotaryov said.Mr. Andersson\u2019s task could hardly have come at a worse moment as relations between Russia and the West have suffered their sharpest deterioration since the Cold War and the economy foundered. Small car sales sank this year, while luxury imports recently surged as wealthy Russians tried to salvage any value from the collapsing ruble.Mr. Andersson began his car career at Saab, then moved to Detroit in 1993, rising to vice president for purchasing at General Motors, with an annual $125 billion budget. He became an American citizen in 2008.After G.M. emerged from its financial crisis, Mr. Andersson decided nothing bigger lay ahead in America. He accepted an offer from a Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, to rebuild the GAZ Group, Russia\u2019s largest manufacturer of light commercial vehicles, headquartered in Nizhny Novgorod.On June 19, 2009, he was in Detroit. On June 20, he started work in Nizhny Novgorod.Mr. Andersson dismissed 50,000 workers, introduced new vehicles and forged joint assembly ventures with Volkswagen, G.M., Skoda and Daimler. The company, after losing $1 billion in 2008, became profitable. He got a profit-sharing clause there, too.The Russian government recruited him to run Avtovaz, which lost more than $500 million last year, Mr. Andersson said. Renault-Nissan and the government jointly own almost 75 percent of Avtovaz, with the remaining shares public.It was a big switch. Nizhny Novgorod is a large, historic, university city. Togliatti is a flat landscape of squat apartment blocks, relieved only by an 11-mile stretch of the Volga River.Mr. Andersson gathers his Russian, French and Japanese managers on the factory floor every morning at 6:45, 15 minutes before the workers. The plant, covering 1,630 acres, includes five car production lines and six component factories, churning out 11 car models.Production charts indicate that quality has improved, but remains uneven. Mr. Andersson grilled his executives about complaints found on the web, like noisy gearboxes. (Top Gear, the British TV show, once compared the Lada transmission sound to a tin tray full of teacups and called the brand \u201cthe lowest form of motoring life.\u201d) He forced all company executives to drive Ladas.As he strides through any workshop, his eyes sweep the floor, and his entourage cringes whenever he reaches down. At one point on the tour he tossed a loose metal ring at a manager.\u201cManagers don\u2019t like it because they felt like he was embarrassing them in front of the workers,\u201d Mr. Tselikov said.Productivity doubled this year to 40 vehicles per worker, Mr. Andersson said. His goal is 60. Lada model changes so far have been \u201clipstick on a pig,\u201d he said, but a new, Russian-designed car line is due next fall.Mr. Andersson described his \u201clast battle\u201d as pushing component producers, some government-owned, to deliver quality parts on time at competitive prices.In Togliatti, views about the factory tend to split along generational lines. The older generation misses the paternal factory and the days when Russians happily bought any car they could find. Residents born after the Soviet Union\u2019s 1991 collapse want modern, reliable and affordable Ladas.Mr. Andersson\u2019s real last battle might be changing Russian perceptions.A few years ago, a bittersweet song about the original Lada said it took a \u201creal man\u201d to drive one. The lyrics cataloged its shortcomings, saying no driver bothers with the blinkers, for example, because he \u201cnever really knows where his car will turn.\u201dThroughout the video, the camera focused periodically on a typically Russian man seemingly highway cruising, but as the camera pulled back, it revealed that the car was actually moving atop a tow truck.An article on Monday about a Swedish-American automobile executive, Bo Inge Andersson, who was recruited by the Russian government to revive its Lada car brand, misidentified another Russian auto manufacturer that Mr. Andersson was recruited to run in 2009. It is the GAZ Group \u2014 not Avtogaz, which is a subsidiary.Nikolai Khalip contributed reporting from Togliatti, and Alexandra Odynova from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Vital Signs in 3rd Quarter Were Strongest in a Decade", "Date": "2014-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy grew last quarter at its fastest rate in over a decade, providing the strongest evidence to date that the recovery is finally gaining sustained power more than five years after it began.Bolstered by robust spending among consumers and businesses alike, economic output rose at an annual rate of 5 percent during the summer months, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, a sharp revision from its earlier estimate of 3.9 percent. The advance followed a second quarter where growth reached a rate of 4.6 percent after a decline last winter that was exacerbated by particularly harsh weather.The revision was led by an upswing in investment by businesses, a powerful force for growth in most economic recoveries but one that has lagged in the latest rebound. Higher consumer spending, including increased outlays on health care, and a narrower trade balance also contributed to the summer improvement. The gain makes the third quarter the strongest since the summer of 2003.The stronger data was greeted happily on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing above the 18,000 level for the first time. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index also hit a record high, while the Nasdaq dropped slightly.The Dow is now up 8.7 percent for the year, while the S.&P. 500 has risen 12.7 percent.Although the growth rate is expected to decelerate somewhat in the current fourth quarter, the improved view in the rearview mirror corresponds with other evidence suggesting that the economy is moving to a higher gear.\u201cThe data today is very consistent with a U.S. consumer that is doing quite well,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cConsumers are receiving a boost in the form of lower gas prices, but they are also feeling more confident about their own futures because of the stronger labor market.\u201dIn a separate Commerce Department report Tuesday morning, the government stated that personal spending jumped 0.6 percent in November, slightly more than expected, while October\u2019s increase was revised upward by 0.1 percentage point to 0.3 percent. Personal income jumped by 0.4 percent in November, the Commerce Department said, ahead of the 0.3 percent rise in October and the 0.2 percent increase in September.\u201cConsumption growth appears to have accelerated further in Q4, with plunging gasoline prices shifting upside to more discretionary areas,\u201d Ted Wieseman, an economist with Morgan Stanley, said in a note to clients after the revised figures on economic growth were released.The only negative indicator in Tuesday\u2019s flood of economic data was a 0.7 percent drop in durable goods orders in November. But durable goods data, tracked by the Census Bureau, is often highly volatile on a month-to-month basis, and economists tend to put more weight on other factors like employment, consumer spending and income.The year\u2019s final Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment, also released Tuesday morning, recorded a small decrease to 93.6 from a preliminary 93.8 report. That still left overall consumer expectations in the survey at their best levels since January 2007, a year before the last recession began.Despite signs of faster growth, the Federal Reserve remains cautious about raising short-term interest rates from near zero, where they have been since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.The central bank is expected to raise rates in mid-2015, but it signaled last week that it would remain patient in order to confirm that faster growth looked sustainable and would translate into increased hiring over the long term.Doug Handler, chief United States economist at IHS, a consulting firm, said the data released Tuesday, along with the recent jobs report and comments by Fed officials, \u201csolidifies our expectations that some action will be taken in June.\u201d\u201cIt looks like we have a stronger economy than we thought a month ago,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich creates a compelling case for tightening.\u201dThe latest data brings the average rate of growth in the first three quarters of 2014 to about 2.5 percent. Mr. Handler said he now expected fourth-quarter growth to be between 2.5 percent and 3 percent, up from an earlier estimate of roughly 2 percent, and predicted that the economy would grow 3 percent next year.The better-than-expected numbers Tuesday morning also prompted other experts to revise their forecasts upward. Macroeconomic Advisers, for example, lifted its estimate of fourth-quarter growth to 2.8 percent from an earlier forecast of 2.6 percent, while Goldman Sachs bumped its forecast to 2.6 percent from 2.2 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "William P. Wilson, Kennedy\u2019s TV Aide for Historic 1960 Debate, Is Dead at 86", "Date": "2014-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn estimated 70 million viewers tuned in for a close-up look at the candidates, both of whom spoke with eloquence and authority on the economy, race relations and the looming Soviet threat. Some historians have said that for those who listened on the radio, Nixon won the debate.But on television there was little question that Kennedy, looking tanned from a California trip, natty and fit in a dark suit, graceful and athletic standing at a lectern perched on a narrow pole, and unflappably cool behind his lightly applied makeup, cut a more appealing figure than his opponent, who had been ill and had lost weight \u2014 his bland gray suit seemed to swim on him \u2014 and who sweated noticeably under the studio lights.The telecast conferred a previously unachieved celebrity on Kennedy and propelled him to a lead in the polls that he never surrendered. After his whisker-thin victory, Kennedy himself acknowledged that it was television that had \u201cturned the tide.\u201dThe man who negotiated the terms of the debate for Kennedy, who insisted on the single-pole podium and who applied Kennedy\u2019s makeup was William P. Wilson, who died on Saturday in Washington at 86. His wife, Melody Miller, said the cause was complications of prostate cancer.In 1960 little was understood about the potential reach of television in American politics. Still, though he was just 32 at the time, Mr. Wilson was as experienced with the medium as anyone in the field. He already had the distinction of being the first television consultant ever hired by a presidential campaign; he had produced commercials for Adlai E. Stevenson, the Democratic candidate in 1956.Stevenson was so unsophisticated about television, according to a story Mr. Wilson told his wife, that when the television set broke in his hotel room, he called Mr. Wilson to come in and fix it.\u201cHe had to explain to Stevenson that he wasn\u2019t a technician,\u201d Ms. Miller said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s how unaware people were about TV.\u201dTelevised debates became standard for presidential campaigns in 1976. (In his successful 1968 and 1972 campaigns, Nixon chose not to participate.) And television itself has become a tool and a weapon that no candidate dares ignore. But a half-century ago, Mr. Wilson was among the few who understood this.Along with Ted Rogers, who was the adviser to Nixon, and Don Hewitt, the CBS producer who handled the event for the television networks, Mr. Wilson negotiated how the set would look: The candidates sat in chairs, flanking the moderator, Howard K. Smith, and rose to a lectern to speak. He thought the single-pole lectern would allow Kennedy to show off his physical figure and grace; he made sure Kennedy wore a dark suit and a blue shirt \u2014 attire that stood out boldly against the studio\u2019s light-colored background. And though the candidates played chicken with each other regarding makeup, each fearful that he would be perceived as unmanly, they each gave in at the last moment.Nixon used a product called Lazy Shave or Shavestick (sources differ on this), and Mr. Wilson was finally able to convince Kennedy that he needed at least a little something. The episode was described by David Halberstam in his book, \u201cThe Powers That Be.\u201d Kennedy, Halberstam wrote, was not going to use makeup if Nixon wasn\u2019t.\u201cBut Wilson insisted he needed some kind of makeup, mostly to close the pores and keep the shine down, and Kennedy asked if Wilson could do it, and Wilson, who knew the neighborhood, ran two blocks to a pharmacy, bought Max Factor Creme Puff, and made Kennedy up very lightly.\u201c \u2018Do you know what you\u2019re doing?\u2019 Kennedy asked.\u201c \u2018Yes,\u2019 Wilson said.\u201c \u2018O.K.,\u2019 Kennedy said. Wilson was impressed by how relaxed he was. On such decisions \u2014 Max Factor Creme Puff instead of Shavestick \u2014 rode the future leadership of the United States and the free world.\u201dWilliam Parmenter Wilson was born in Chicago on Sept. 4, 1928, to Stephen Wilson, a lawyer, and the former Jane Parmenter; his father\u2019s father, William Wilson, was a Republican congressman from Illinois. William was sent to military school and later graduated from Lake Forest Academy, north of Chicago.Mr. Wilson\u2019s first marriage, to Penelope Coaker, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, Ms. Miller, a former spokeswoman for the Kennedy family whom he married in 1997, he is survived by a daughter, Eliza Wilson Ingle, and three granddaughters.\u201cI took him to where he was supposed to go,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cI heard the stage manager doing \u201910, 9, 8 ...\u2019 He made that stage on 1. What it did was freeze the room, because everybody there thought, \u2018We\u2019re without one of the contestants.\u2019 And two, it psyched Nixon out. Because J.F.K. walked in, sat down, crossed his legs, like this, and didn\u2019t look at anybody.\u201dAn obituary on Friday about William P.

{"Headline": "Recovery at Last?", "Date": "2014-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd there are some important lessons from this belated good news. It doesn\u2019t vindicate policies that permitted seven years and counting of depressed incomes and employment. But it does put the lie to some of the nonsense you hear about why the economy has lagged.Let\u2019s talk first about reasons not to celebrate.Things are finally looking better for American workers, but this improvement comes after years of suffering, with long-term unemployment in particular lingering at levels not seen since the 1930s. Millions of families lost their homes, their savings, or both. Many young Americans graduated into a labor market that didn\u2019t want their skills, and will never get back onto the career tracks they should have had.So it has been a terrible seven years, and even a string of good job reports won\u2019t undo the damage. Why was it so bad?O.K., at this point I\u2019m sure many readers are thinking that they\u2019ve been hearing a very different story about what went wrong \u2014 the conservative story that attributes the sluggish recovery to the terrible, horrible, no-good attitude of the Obama administration. The president, we\u2019re told, scared businesspeople by talking about \u201cfat cats\u201d on Wall Street and generally looking at them funny. Also, Obamacare has killed jobs, right?Just to be clear, I\u2019m not calling the Obama-era economy a success story. We needed faster job growth this time around than under Mr. Bush, because the recession was deeper, and unemployment stayed far too high for far too long. But we can now say with confidence that the recovery\u2019s weakness had nothing to do with Mr. Obama\u2019s (falsely) alleged anti-business slant. What it reflected, instead, was the damage done by government paralysis \u2014 paralysis that has, alas, richly rewarded the very politicians who caused it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Police Killings Reveal Chasms Between Races ", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFERGUSON, Mo. \u2014 In the decade that Ashley Bernaugh, who is white, has been with her black husband, her family in Indiana has been so smitten with him that she teases them that they love him more than her.So Ms. Bernaugh was somewhat surprised by her family\u2019s reaction after Darren Wilson, a white police officer here, killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. Forced into more frank discussions about race with her family than ever before, Ms. Bernaugh, 29, said her relatives seemed more outraged by the demonstrations than the killing, which she saw as an injustice.\u201cThey don\u2019t understand it\u2019s as prevalent as it is,\u201d Ms. Bernaugh said, referring to racial discrimination. \u201cIt\u2019s just disappointing to think that your family wants to pigeonhole a whole race of people, buy into the rhetoric that, \u2018Oh, these are violent protests.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIt is as if Ms. Bernaugh, a nonprofit organizer living in the St. Louis suburb of Florissant, is straddling two worlds. In one, her black mother-in-law is patting her on the back, saying she is proud of her for speaking out against Mr. Brown\u2019s killing. In the other, her white family and friends are telling her to quiet down because \u201cyou don\u2019t know the whole picture.\u201dPut bluntly, many people say, they feel they are being forced to pick a team.In interviews here and around the country, both blacks and whites described tense conversations in office cubicles or across dinner tables about the killings and subsequent protests. Many described being surprised to learn, often on social media, about the opinions \u2014 and stereotypes \u2014 held by family and friends about people of other races. In some cases, those relationships have fractured, in person and online.Kenny Hargrove, a black man from Brooklyn married to a white woman, said he and his wife confronted one of his in-laws for posting a racially insensitive meme on Facebook around the time Mr. Brown was killed. The relative was so upset that she unfriended them. Now, she is trying to mend fences and has sent a new friend request. But Mr. Hargrove, 36, said he was torn about whether to hit \u201cconfirm.\u201d\u201cIf I see one stupid thing from you, it\u2019s over forever,\u201d Mr. Hargrove said.In fact, the day that a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict a police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, Mr. Hargrove posted this to his Facebook page: \u201cThis is for anyone still left on my friends list who\u2019s wondering why black people are so angry right now. If you still don\u2019t get it, if you still can\u2019t see the pattern, if you still think the protests are nothing more than angry thugs who just want free TVs, let me know. I don\u2019t have the energy to connect the dots for you, but I do have just enough left to hit \u2018unfriend.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBut Peter Weiss, a white resident of Staten Island, said many black people seem unwilling to consider alternative perspectives on police violence. To illustrate his point, Mr. Weiss, 41, described an encounter on Wednesday at Karl\u2019s Klipper, a bar and restaurant in Staten Island, when news flashed on a television screen that the grand jury had decided not to indict. An African-American whom he was friendly with walked over and called him a redneck, Mr. Weiss said.The acquaintance was normally calm, kind and sensitive, but the news had set him off, Mr. Weiss said. The exchange solidified his belief that people were reaching conclusions about current events based on past racism that, in his view, no longer exists.\u201cBlacks and whites, we don\u2019t hate anymore, there is no real racism anymore for anything real, like who can get a job,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, people are so stuck on the past, people need to grow up.\u201dAttitudes like that are why David Odom believes that race relations have deteriorated amid the recent police killings, and why he avoids talking to white people about sensitive racial topics. Blacks and whites come from different experiences, so reconciling their world views is too difficult, he said.Mr. Odom, 50, a black lawyer living in the affluent, mostly white Chicago suburb of Naperville, recalled trying to explain to a close white friend why he thought the grand jury process in Mr. Brown\u2019s case was racist.\u201cHe didn\u2019t believe it because, in his mind, he believed that the judicial system isn\u2019t rigged,\u201d Mr. Odom said. \u201cHe believed that the judicial system and the criminal justice system generally is fair, and I don\u2019t. There\u2019s a chasm between us.\u201dA black infantry lieutenant in Texas said he is generally hawkish about foreign policy and conservative on the economy. So some of his white Army colleagues were surprised to hear his reaction to the non-indictment in the Garner case.Several people came into his office the day it was announced and said, \u201cCan you believe these idiots in New York protesting?\u201d said the lieutenant, Christopher, who asked that his last name be withheld because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. His response, he said, was, \u201cCan you believe these idiots didn\u2019t hand out an indictment?\u201dHe got awkward looks in response. \u201cA lot of people at work, they have no idea how to respond to me right now,\u201d he said.Divisions over the killings are not simply black and white. They also run along generational, socioeconomic and geographical lines. Whites have joined blacks in street protests here and across the nation against police violence. And some blacks have joined whites in raising concerns about the behavior of blacks. Still, in Ferguson, some whites said they felt like blacks had rushed to judgment in condemning them as bigots.In Old Ferguson, where the police station is, a group of mostly black demonstrators marched down the street one recent, frigid evening, chanting angry slogans, and as they came upon Marley\u2019s Bar and Grill, a line of police officers quickly formed between them and the establishment. The patrons inside were mostly white, and demonstrators stood outside yelling at them. When protesters peered in through a window and took pictures, some of the patrons pulled down a shade.\u201cWe were told many times we were going to burn to the ground because we were white owners,\u201d said Kelly Braun, 48, who owns the corner bar with her husband. \u201cThey yell stuff at us.\u201dMs. Braun said her bar usually hosts a diverse crowd. But many black patrons have stayed away recently, dismayed over some of the actions on the street, she said.\u201cI\u2019ve had so many apologies from different people \u2014 it\u2019s because they\u2019re embarrassed,\u201d she said.For some black business owners in Ferguson, the calculation about the protesters\u2019 demands and the community\u2019s well-being is a more complicated one.Cathy Jenkins, who owns Cathy\u2019s Kitchen with her husband, has experienced the wrath of angry demonstrations \u2014 someone threw a chair through one of her restaurant\u2019s windows the night the grand jury decision in the Brown case was announced. But she has also experienced racism: Someone has been calling the restaurant regularly and repeating the N-word when the phone is answered.Not surprisingly, she was torn about the reaction, sometimes violent, to the Brown killing. \u201cI don\u2019t want the community torn up, but I believe in standing up for your rights when it\u2019s something that\u2019s just,\u201d she said.Montague Simmons expected resistance last month when he and 20 other people slipped into the election night party of the newly elected St. Louis County executive, Steve Stenger, to protest Mr. Stenger\u2019s support of Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecutor who many Brown supporters said mishandled the grand jury investigation of Mr. Wilson. But Mr. Simmons, a black union organizer, said he never thought the stiffest opposition would come from people he considered close allies.As several demonstrators clustered to begin chanting, Mr. Simmons said, some white union members joined in trying to block them, while also identifying them to the police. These were the same white union members, Mr. Simmons said, whom he had worked with to advocate for things like raising the minimum wage and protecting collective bargaining rights.\u201cIn any other setting, any other fight over the last two or three years, we\u2019d be shoulder to shoulder,\u201d Mr. Simmons said. \u201cWhen it comes to race, all of a sudden that\u2019s not the case.\u201dA picture caption on Saturday with the continuation of an article about the sharp differences in race relations exposed by the deaths of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Mo., and New York City misstated the sentiment that one person interviewed, Ashley Bernaugh, saw in the comments by her family. She considered the comments misinformed, not racist.Reporting was contributed by Nate Schweber and Mosi Secret from New York, and Manny Fernandez, Mitch Smith, Monica Davey and Campbell Robertson from Ferguson.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keeping Score on the Budget", "Date": "2014-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAs they prepare to take control of Congress next year, Republican leaders are looking for ways to present their agenda in a flattering light.The task is difficult because many of their core beliefs \u2014 that markets self-regulate, austerity is expansionary and tax cuts for the wealthy create broad prosperity \u2014 have been discredited. If they were true, the financial crisis would have been avoided, the economy would be robust and the middle class would be thriving. To bridge the gap between belief and evidence, some Republicans have begun calling for \u201cdynamic scoring,\u201d a way of estimating the cost of tax cuts and spending bills by including consideration of how the proposals might affect the size and growth rate of the overall economy. The problem is that this approach, which is rooted in supply-side theory favored by conservatives, can be used to yield almost any result. Not surprisingly, the biggest champions so far of dynamic scoring are Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who will take over the tax committee; Representative Tom Price of Georgia, who will take over the budget committee; and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who will take over the finance committee. In making their case for dynamic scoring, Republicans invariably claim that the cost-estimating techniques currently used by the Congressional Budget Office and other agencies are \u201cstatic.\u201d That is plain wrong. The C.B.O.\u2019s estimates include a range of behavioral and economic effects. For instance, in scoring a bill to increase the capital gains tax, estimators would take into account the likely impact of higher taxes on investors\u2019 decisions on whether and when to sell a stock; in scoring a bill that proposes to increase the gasoline tax, they would take into account the influence on people\u2019s driving habits. What such estimates do not include \u2014 and what dynamic scoring would include \u2014 are the potential effects of a tax change on the overall size of the economy and how that would raise or lower federal revenues. Such macroeconomic effects are excluded because they are wildly uncertain \u2014 as evidenced by the range of estimates to the Camp proposal. Besides, traditional cost estimates come packaged with macroeconomic analyses by the estimators when legislators ask for the information. Those analyses are important, but they cannot be reliably quantified. So they are correctly excluded from the cost estimate. If they insist on using dynamic scoring for cost estimates, however, they will be hard-pressed to attract or retain top talent \u2014 and they will undermine the C.B.O., a rare bastion of nonpartisan analysis in a town that badly needs a neutral scorekeeper.

The resulting book, with its abundance of colorful culinary and etymological history framing serious research, is a model of rigor and readability.At this scale, reviews are no longer opinions: They are data. We learn that positive beer reviews tend to use vague words (amazing, perfect, incredible), whereas negative ones are specific and even technical in their vocabulary (metallic, colorless, overcarbonated). Bad experiences in restaurants become narratives, using the pronouns \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d much more often than in positive reviews (\u201cwe waited,\u201d \u201cour entrees\u201d). The most common words used in negative reviews don\u2019t even have to do with food: manager, attitude, mistake, tip. Jurafsky is particularly skilled at connecting familiar food words with surprising linguistic patterns, and there are revelations on nearly every page. A large number of sexual metaphors in positive restaurant reviews correlates with higher prices on the menu. The language of drug addiction (\u201cThese cupcakes are like crack\u201d) is associated with junk food \u2014 blaming the food that we know is bad for us. Expensive potato chips use negative phrases relating to craft (\u201cnever fried,\u201d \u201cnothing fake or phony\u201d), while inexpensive potato chips emphasize \u201ctradition\u201d or \u201cclassic\u201d recipes. Ice cream is usually named with round open vowels (\u201cRocky Road,\u201d \u201cCookie Dough\u201d), but cracker names tend to use thin-sounding closed vowels (\u201cRitz,\u201d \u201cWheat Thins,\u201d \u201cTriscuit\u201d).Though food terms are the richest source of new foreign-language additions to English dictionaries today, the process by which one culture adopts another\u2019s cuisine is nothing new. A word\u2019s etymology is its biography, telling the story of how it came to have the meaning we know. In tandem with his many etymological histories, Jurafsky traces the history of the foods themselves: Ketchup was originally a fish sauce; sushi initially used fermented fish; pecan pie started as custard; fish and chips, ceviche and tempura all hark back to an ancient recipe invented by Zoroastrian Persians. His brilliant achievement is to weave together the journey food makes through culture with the journey its name makes through language.John Lanchester has also written engagingly about food, particularly in his outrageous and delectable novel \u201cThe Debt to Pleasure.\u201d But his attention has recently shifted to finance, and particularly the task of putting the Humpty Dumpty world economy back together after the crisis of 2008. A writer with a fine-tuned ear for irony, Lanchester perceives the often opaque language of banking as a cloak \u2014 intentional or not \u2014 for the dubious actions of financial institutions. He explains this language in \u201cHow to Speak Money,\u201d an idiosyncratic collection of short, sharp essays translating the jargon of finance with admirable concision and wit.Translation is necessary because so many of these terms have come to mean the opposite of what they seem to mean. Lanchester coins the term \u201creversification\u201d to describe this phenomenon. \u201cBailout\u201d goes from pouring water out to pouring money in. \u201cInflation\u201d doesn\u2019t mean getting larger but rather buying less. \u201cSecurity\u201d now means risk, and \u201ccredit\u201d now means debt. A hedge fund should mean a fund that is protected against loss; instead hedge funds are enormously risky bets \u2014 he notes that 90 percent fail \u2014 that are nevertheless largely unregulated. The confusion of important terms is also a problem: How can voters make informed decisions if they keep mixing up mean and median, or debt and deficit?Reversification also occurs at the level of economic theory and practice. The problem with mortgage-backed securities wasn\u2019t the mortgages or the securities \u2014 it was the backing. If the institution that granted the mortgage no longer has a stake in its payment, Lanchester writes, \u201cthe basic premise of banking \u2014 that you lend money only to people who can pay it back \u2014 has been broken.\u201d This led to the reversal of the fundamental tenet of neoliberal economics \u201cthat markets can self-regulate,\u201d since the markets created the problem that governments then had to step in to fix. Profits were private, but losses were shared: another dismaying switcheroo.The result is increasing inequality, the moral backdrop of the book. The neoliberal mantra of cutting taxes on the rich, dominant since the era of Reagan and Thatcher, was accompanied by the promise that all incomes would rise accordingly. Instead, though G.D.P. has grown, an astonishing increase in the assets of the already rich has not led to improvement for the poor and middle-class. In Lanchester\u2019s words, \u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear that if these policies were going to work, they would have already worked by now.\u201d Two other recently published glossaries are much slighter. In \u201cHow to Speak Brit,\u201d Christopher J. Moore actually provides little advice on how to understand British English. His short but desultory miscellany includes entries for \u201ceavesdropper,\u201d \u201clame duck,\u201d \u201cegghead\u201d and many other terms that are perfectly standard in American English. The articles are light in tone but often brittle and charmless; the definition for \u201canorak\u201d reads: \u201cA sloppy, unattractive waterproof coat and a slang word for a person who is gray and colorless, such as a politician.\u201d The \u201cposh\u201d entry is devoted to the notion that wealthy steamship passengers\u2019 trunks were formerly marked \u201cPort Out, Starboard Home,\u201d presumably for cooler cabins on the voyage to India \u2014 a story so thoroughly and frequently debunked that the Oxford English Dictionary warns readers about it. Elsewhere, he seems to lament the fading importance of the \u00adupper-crust accent. Moore\u2019s working conviction seems to be that English comes from England and that it used to be better.THE LANGUAGE OF FOODA Linguist Reads the MenuBy Dan JurafskyIllustrated. 246 pp. W. W.

The three smaller parties in the government also said they would support it.The British aid will enable Northern Ireland to avert some of the steep welfare reductions imposed elsewhere in Britain. It could also clear the way for Northern Ireland to reduce its corporate tax rate, now 21 percent, to the same as Ireland\u2019s, 12.5 percent.A more competitive tax rate could bolster Northern Ireland\u2019s economy by encouraging businesses to establish themselves there. Northern Ireland has lagged economically and has been seen by some in Britain as a financial drain.Welcoming the agreement, Mr. Cameron said it would allow Northern Ireland to \u201cgenuinely begin to overcome the key outstanding issues which have been unresolved since the Belfast Agreement.\u201d He was using an alternate name for the Good Friday accord.The agreement includes the creation of an oral history archive and an investigative body to look into deaths during the Northern Ireland conflict.Amy Chozick contributed reporting from Kailua, Hawaii.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiss National Bank to Adopt a Negative Interest Rate", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Switzerland is introducing a negative interest rate on deposits held by lenders at its central bank, moving to hold down the value of the Swiss franc amid turmoil in global currency markets and expectations that deflation is at hand.The bank acted as the crisis in Russia and plummeting oil prices have caused a run on emerging market currencies. Switzerland, known for its fiscal rectitude and banking secrecy, tends to attract capital inflows as money flees chaos elsewhere. But that puts pressure on the franc, threatening to make exporters less competitive and raising the risk that very low price pressures will tip the economy into outright deflation.\u201cOver the past few days, a number of factors have prompted increased demand for safe investments,\u201d the central bank said. \u201cThe introduction of negative interest rates makes it less attractive to hold Swiss franc investments, and thereby supports the minimum exchange rate.\u201dThe franc, which had been creeping toward the central bank\u2019s limit on the currency, retreated modestly. The euro rose 0.3 percent to 1.2046 while the dollar rose 0.8 percent to 0.9805 francs.Analysts were skeptical that the new policy would significantly reduce demand for Swiss assets while emerging markets were in turmoil.\u201cIt\u2019s an external factor that has precipitated them to take this action,\u201d said Derek Halpenny, the European head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. \u201cIs a negative interest rate going to solve their problem? I don\u2019t think so.\u201dStill, Mr. Halpenny said, it was \u201ca 100 percent certainty\u201d that the Swiss National Bank\u2019s 1.2-franc line in the sand would hold for as long as the central bank was willing to vacuum up as many euros as needed. The central bank maintains that floor by selling francs on the open market in exchange for euros, pushing down the franc and supporting the euro.Since 2009, Mr. Halpenny noted, the central bank has quintupled its foreign currency holdings to 470 billion francs, as it intervened to hold down the franc.The central bank said the new policy was meant to push its key interest rate \u2014 the three-month London interbank offered rate for Swiss franc loans between banks \u2014 below zero. Doing so would tend to make short-term Swiss assets like franc-denominated money market funds and debt securities less attractive. The policy, which is not aimed at individuals, affects only financial institutions on the portion of their deposits over 10 million francs, or $10.2 million.Thomas J. Jordan, governor of the Swiss central bank, told a news conference in Zurich on Thursday that the effect on the rates paid on individual savers\u2019 accounts by banks was beyond the central bank\u2019s responsibility, but that the move was \u201cno different from any other interest rate cuts by a central bank.\u201dThe interest rates paid to savers in Switzerland are already extremely low, so there is little room for lenders to cut further.In putting in place the negative rate, in essence a tax on excess deposits, the Swiss monetary authority joins the European Central Bank, which introduced its own negative 0.1 percent deposit rate in June, and then changed that to minus 0.2 percent in September.The European Central Bank action was aimed at a different problem: the failure of eurozone banks to increase lending to businesses, one of the factors that is holding back growth in the region. So far, the action has not borne fruit, and lending has continued to contract.For the Swiss central bank, which seeks to hold inflation at the consumer level to less than 2 percent, fears that an overvalued franc will choke growth and stoke deflation are real. Swiss consumer prices declined by 0.1 percent in November from a year earlier, the Federal Statistical Office reported on Dec. 8. The Swiss central bank said on Wednesday that it expected prices to be unchanged over all in 2014 and that next year, prices would contract 0.1 percent, slipping into outright deflation.Deflation hurts borrowers by increasing the burden of loan repayments in real terms, the last thing central bankers want when the financial system has not fully recovered from the global credit crisis. Falling prices also hurt the economy by reducing investment and consumption, and the monetary tools for addressing it are limited. But even ultralow inflation as is being experienced in the neighboring eurozone is hinders growth.Short-term interest rates, the main lever for monetary policy in normal times, have been cut to rock-bottom levels across the developed world, and nominal rates cannot go below zero. That has led central bankers to try unorthodox measures, including charging banks to hold deposits and so-called quantitative easing, purchasing bonds on a vast scale to increase liquidity.Forecasts that rates would rise from near zero have been proved wrong for six years running, as the global financial system remained fragile and growth failed to reach pre-crisis momentum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Focusing on Future, Cuba Leaves Fidel Castro to History", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey said nothing of Fidel.\u201cIt\u2019s a break with the past, and a transition,\u201d said Jorge Luis Rivero Gonz\u00e1lez, 26, a master\u2019s student in information technology. \u201cWhat we have now is hope for a new path. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming, but it better be good.\u201dFidel is still an imposing figure in the Cuban consciousness, a leader so venerable and fiercely protected that many avoid talking about him at all. Few here or in Washington, where the name Fidel is often shorthand for communist revolution itself, suggested that d\u00e9tente with the United States could have happened without his approval.Some of the former leader\u2019s most loyal followers here have even described Mr. Obama\u2019s recognition of Cuba with a Castro still in power as a final triumph for Fidel \u2014 a formal nod of respect that the old guerrillero has demanded since 1959.There was even some Fidel-like braggadocio in the speech by his brother Ra\u00fal, who celebrated the return on Wednesday of Cuba\u2019s three convicted spies from the United States with a rare flair for theatrics. After years of appearing mostly in a suit, Ra\u00fal was careful to wear his military uniform, linking the prisoners\u2019 release to \u201cComrade Fidel\u201d and his promise years ago to bring the men home.Some experts argued that it was yet another sign that on big, geopolitical questions, the Castro brothers largely remain in sync.\u201cRa\u00fal and Fidel have no daylight between them on things like this,\u201d said Julia Sweig, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies Cuba. \u201cThey have been in complete lock step on Cuban foreign policy.\u201dAnd yet the new Cuba that Ra\u00fal is fashioning from the old is a far cry from Fidel\u2019s youthful revolution. Today\u2019s Cuba seems less concerned with ideals than dollars. It is a hatchery of private enterprise and nascent inequality, where property can be bought and sold, along with cars and filet mignon. It is a proud country, tired of struggling, where the poor can see the rich rising along the way to Ra\u00fal\u2019s stated goals: economic growth and stability.\u201cRa\u00fal is a pragmatist; he is not a mindless idealist,\u201d said Brian Latell, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who has written books on the Castros. \u201cFidel has always been the heavy anchor on change and reform.\u201dPerhaps the difference is that now, with Cuba\u2019s economy still on the edge of collapse, that weight seems to be lifting as Fidel fades further from view.Young Cubans like Honey Hernan, 14, who was walking home from school on Thursday past the Museum of the Revolution, can hardly remember a time when Fidel was a recognizable presence. \u201cHe\u2019s never really on TV,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just Ra\u00fal.\u201dLittle of the gated, heavily guarded compound where Fidel lives in west Havana is even visible from the street. Much of what is known of it comes from the pictures and videotapes of buildings and landscaped gardens that associates of the family have leaked over the years.Some older Cubans, like Prospero Gamboa, 68, who was discussing the new era with friends on a street corner in Old Havana, noted that the deal with the United States had been set in motion with the economic changes that Ra\u00fal established starting in 2006, when he first stepped in for an ailing Fidel.\u201cThis has been building,\u201d Mr. Gamboa said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a change in the mentality.\u201dThis waning of Fidel is the norm even in some of the places where he defined his destiny. In the lobby of the University of Havana Law School, a poster offered students a chance to study his famous defense after being arrested for storming the Moncada barracks in 1953, when he said, \u201cHistory will absolve me.\u201d But the poster was only one of many offerings, with others promoting live music or posting final grades and student election results.If anything, the university and a half-dozen other stops across Havana on Thursday seemed to demonstrate what many Cubans describe as the new reality: Fidel Castro is increasingly a figure of the Cold War, to be celebrated, scrutinized, reviled \u2014 but almost never experienced.It is not the principles that have changed, many students emphasized. Equality and sovereignty are among the most cited virtues by young, passionate Cubans following in Fidel\u2019s academic footsteps. But to many of them, the relentless campaign against the ever-present enemy of the United States \u2014 Fidel\u2019s lifelong mission \u2014 seems as dated as the tanks that dot the campus and countless public spaces all over Havana.Cubans of all ages now say that there are simply too many relatives in the United States who come back to visit regularly to justify the idea of perpetual conflict.11 Photos\u201cIt\u2019s the same revolution in a totally different phase,\u201d said Anabel Bollet, 22, a fifth-year law student. The changes announced this week, she said, amount to a historic but subtle \u201cadjustment.\u201d It is not peace. Rather, she added, \u201cit\u2019s a way to resolve the conflict without guns.\u201dTo some degree, many Cubans argued, the openness of Mr. Obama and Ra\u00fal to normalized political relations amounts to a classic case of government catching up with the people.Ever since Mr. Obama opened unlimited travel and remittances to Cuban-Americans in 2009, followed by Ra\u00fal\u2019s easing of limits on travel for Cubans, a steady flow of Cubans and dollars has strengthened the filial bonds that were severed during the revolution between Cubans on opposite sides of the Florida straits.This is the United States-Cuba relationship that a growing number of Cubans know, understand and cherish, no matter where they are. The distrust and defiance that their leaders are only now addressing is more of a backdrop.It was no coincidence that on Thursday, when asked who would benefit most from the new thaw, many Cubans answered \u201cthe Cuban people,\u201d even before they were asked to choose between Ra\u00fal Castro and Mr. Obama.That was true for loyal Fidelistas and for stiff-backed critics of Fidel\u2019s government.Nor was it a surprise that there was only one person outside the United States Interests Section on Thursday morning: a woman with a broom who was sweeping up outside a monument painted in large block letters with the Cuban government\u2019s message declaring \u201cpatria o muerte\u201d (fatherland or death\u201d) and \u201cvenceremos\u201d (we will overcome).A block away, hundreds of Cubans of all ages gathered in a small park, carefully holding folders of documents, waiting to be told where to stand to get an American tourist visa to visit their sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, or fathers and mothers in Miami and beyond.Randal C.

{"Headline": "U.S. Retail Sales Signal an Economy Starting to Rev Up", "Date": "2014-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrightening IndicatorsThe United States economy is firing on all cylinders as the year comes to a close.That\u2019s the only conclusion that can be drawn from a blockbuster report on November retail sales released on Thursday, particularly when coupled with other recent readings on jobs, industrial activity and more.Total retail sales rose 0.7 percent in November, as holiday shopping began, and that came despite a sharp tumble in gasoline prices that reduced the dollar value of sales at gas stations by 0.8 percent. Analysts had expected a rise of only 0.4 percent.But more broadly, it\u2019s worth stepping back and considering just how rosy the recent readings on the economy are.The November retail sales number could well be a fluke. But only 11 days into December, here is a partial list of readings on the economy that have handily beat already-strong analyst forecasts: Institute for Supply Management\u2019s survey of manufacturing firms; its survey of nonmanufacturing firms; motor vehicle sales; construction spending; job growth; wage growth; and now retail sales. The only major piece of data that has been disappointing was a negative report this week on factory orders, a volatile series of data.Some of that is supported by falling oil prices that are making energy less expensive and, in effect, increasing real incomes by leaving consumers with more money to spend on everything else. But not uniformly. The construction spending numbers are backward looking, largely reflecting decisions made before the oil price tumble. Employers don\u2019t generally make hiring and pay decisions based on the latest fluctuations of global commodity markets.And in terms of retail sales, it takes time for falling oil prices to be reflected in lower prices for gasoline and other consumer goods, so to the degree it is a tailwind, it should play out over the coming months. Some of the sharpest declines in oil prices came at the end of November and are not yet reflected in consumer prices.Might one explanation be that the economic picture is less sunny than it seemed, and that the bad tidings from the oil and bond markets was operating as an early warning system for some simmering weakness? The data we\u2019ve seen since then suggest the answer is a resounding \u201cNo.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The United States benchmark, known as West Texas Intermediate, is just above $59 and the Brent international benchmark is below $64. Some Wall Street analysts have predicted crude could trade below $50 in the coming weeks.The collapse in prices has led to a rising tide of oil company announcements this week of investment cuts for 2015. Oasis Petroleum of Houston, an important producer in North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale field, said it would slash its drilling budget from $1.4 billion to $750 million.Goodrich Petroleum, another company based in Houston with production in Texas and Louisiana shale fields, announced it would cut its 2015 drilling budget from more than $325 million to between $150 million and $200 million.Many of the largest oil companies have also said they will cut their investments and lay off some employees, but most are projecting higher production in both their shale fields and in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.Lower oil and gasoline prices should help consumers, particularly those in the lower income brackets who generally drive older, less efficient cars and whose energy costs represent a larger proportion of their incomes.But many here in Texas remember the oil price bust in the 1980s that crushed the state economy, leading to high unemployment in the petroleum fields and bank failures.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BY ERNST & YOUNG, LLC.Rising anxiety over the prospects for the global economy in 2015 hasn\u2019t shaken the confidence of corporate dealmakers, especially in the United States. Among senior executives recently surveyed by EY, more than 80 percent of U.S. respondents said they expect the global market for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to improve in the next 12 months, compared with 60 percent of respondents globally.U.S. executives\u2019 confidence in the M&A market reflects their notable optimism about the stability of the economic environment, as the survey found broad-based positive sentiment regarding corporate earnings, credit and market stability, and job creation. These executives overwhelmingly see the economic outlook as either stable or improving, both globally and in the U.S. By comparison, executives outside the U.S., facing greater exposure to geopolitical instability and economic headwinds, appear to be shifting their outlook from improving to stable.\u201cAfter a slow but steady macroeconomic recovery that saw the U.S. out in front, our most recent survey gives every indication that the U.S. will be ahead of the curve in dealmaking, as well,\u201d says Richard M. Jeanneret, EY\u2019s Americas Vice Chair, Transaction Advisory Services. \u201cU.S. executives appear to have factored some amount of macroeconomic risk into their outlook and are prepared to transact in this new environment.\u201dBeyond these megadeals, the growth engine of M&A over the next year is likely to be the middle market, involving matches valued at less than $1 billion. EY\u2019s analysis of year-on-year changes in deal volumes shows that previous upturns have been led by megadeals and upper-middle-market deals, followed by an upswing in the lower middle market. Large transactions create M&A activity further down the deal-size chain as companies look to reshape recently acquired assets.\u201cIn the U.S., the cycle is proceeding on schedule, as we see a major increase in companies\u2019 expectations for deals in the middle market,\u201d says Jeanneret. Seventy-one percent of U.S. executives say their sweet spot during the next 12 months will be deal values between $50 million and $250 million; that category is up from only 43 percent in EY\u2019s April 2014 survey. \u201cWe believe the confidence we have seen this year via the larger deals will cross over to the middle market, as dealmakers take more risk in light of an overall improving economic environment,\u201d Jeanneret adds.Executives\u2019 approach to dealmaking appears to be more disciplined than it was a decade ago. When asked whether they will actually execute a deal in the next 12 months, one-third of U.S. companies say yes \u2014 an improvement from the April 2014 survey, but still a fairly modest result. The number of U.S. companies planning acquisitions is lower than the overall global number and contrasts with U.S. respondents\u2019 more positive outlook for deal market growth.The explanation may lie in U.S. executives\u2019 concern over their ability to complete deals. Just over one-third of executives are confident about the likelihood of closing acquisitions. Executives\u2019 caution may also reflect increased rigor in their search for and analysis of strategically aligned assets, their more thorough due diligence and the greater overall competition for quality assets.Renewed discipline in dealmaking is causing companies to thoroughly examine many more investment opportunities to find the best strategic fit. The number of U.S. companies that have more than five deals in their respective pipelines has increased significantly \u2014 up to 41 percent from only 8 percent six months ago.Overall, the number of deals being considered by respondents has substantially increased, with the aggregate global total up 30 percent since April 2014. In addition, two-thirds of executives expect M&A pipelines to expand further over the next year \u2014 more than double the number expecting expansion six months ago. Global respondents have fewer deals currently in the pipeline than U.S. companies, but they are more likely than U.S. executives to anticipate pipeline growth over the next 12 months \u2014 confirming that the U.S. is further along in its M&A upswing.Although the overwhelming majority of companies are focusing on acquiring businesses in their core sectors, U.S. companies are much more likely than their global counterparts to consider high-risk or \u201cdisruptive\u201d investments \u2014 again indicating that the U.S. M&A market is ahead of the curve.About half of U.S. companies expect their inorganic growth to take the form of \u201cdisruptive\u201d deals \u2014 acquisitions that change the structure and direction of their business models \u2014 compared with less than a quarter of global companies. \u201cU.S. companies would rather be transformative than incremental,\u201d says Jeanneret.Executives in the automotive and transportation sector expressed the keenest interest in dealmaking. Just over half (51 percent) said they expected their company to pursue acquisitions during the next 12 months, compared with 33 percent of all U.S. executives surveyed.The sector\u2019s M&A activity is being driven by renewed optimism around increasing sales in both developed and emerging markets and an industry-wide drive to decrease costs and improve efficiencies. A significant number of deals have focused on acquiring emergent technologies, such as driverless cars, and advanced materials.As they intensify their pursuit of deals, U.S. executives are also stepping up their efforts to proactively respond to the trend of shareholder activism, according to the EY survey. Nearly a third of U.S. companies are watching out for early warning signs of activist pressure, and close to one-fifth are conducting a so-called \u201cactivist audit\u201d to improve cost controls, efficiencies and performance.U.S. executives also expect global megatrends to have a significant impact on their business and acquisition strategies. Like their global counterparts, U.S. executives cite the future of work \u2014 shifting employment patterns and the impact of technology and mobility on workplace practices \u2014 as their key concern. Accordingly, 48 percent said it would affect their core business strategy more than any other trend in the next 12 months.\u201cThe move to a more flexible workforce will provide more opportunities for collaboration and productivity, as well as acquisitions,\u201d says Jeanneret. \u201cDealmaking in many industries, especially those that are high-tech or IP-rich, will center on the battle for talent.\u201dU.S. executives cited digital transformation as a leading concern for both business and acquisition strategies. Emergent technologies are combining with advanced networks, computing and new ways of communicating to fundamentally change businesses.\u201cAs companies adapt to these advances, dealmakers in all industries will need to decide where to strategically invest in technology,\u201d says Jeanneret. \u201cFront-end early adapters will be the most attractive acquisition targets, offering innovative and nimble strategic capabilities to acquirers.\u201dAdditional ResourcesThe DealFoxCNBCDownload full report:Capital Confidence Barometer | Global | October 2014Capital Confidence Barometer | United States | October 2014This page was paid for and produced by Ernst and Young.

Get a Tepid Response Among Eurozone Banks", "Date": "2014-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe response is likely to reinforce expectations that the central bank will soon have no choice but to begin large-scale asset purchases to pump money into the flagging eurozone economy.The loans are part of a broader effort by the central bank to inject as much as 1 trillion euros into the eurozone economy and to reverse a decline in inflation. The borrowing data is being closely watched as an indicator of whether the central bank would be able to meet its goal.But banks took \u20ac130 billion, or about $161 billion, in loans from the central bank, which offered a fixed interest rate of 0.15 percent for four years. In the first round of loans in September, banks borrowed \u20ac82.6 billion. In all, European banks have tapped only about half the available money since the cheap loans were first offered in September.The latest inflation data on Thursday only adds to that pressure. In France, consumer prices fell at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in November. The figure is likely to heighten fears that very low inflation is becoming entrenched, trapping the eurozone in long-term stagnation similar to the kind that has afflicted Japan since the 1990s.The central bank cash is intended to drive down the cost of borrowing and encourage lending, especially in countries like Italy and Portugal, where a lack of credit has impeded economic growth. Banks that take advantage of the central bank\u2019s loans must show that they are using the money to increase lending to households and businesses.The drawback of the European Central Bank\u2019s strategy is that it is dependent on whether banks want the money. Large-scale asset purchases, on the other hand, are a way of effectively printing money regardless of bank behavior.Given the continuing reluctance of banks to lend even when the central bank is offering them money at close to zero interest, the central bank may have no choice but to step up asset purchases by buying government bonds.The central bank, in a separate program, has already been buying packages of bank loans known as covered bonds or asset-backed securities. The volume, about \u20ac21.5 billion, has been small because the supply of such private sector assets is limited. And it remains far short of the E.C.B\u2019s goal to buy assets of \u20ac1 trillion goal.Some analysts predict the central bank will announce a government bond buying program at its next meeting on Jan. 22. Others expect the central bank to wait until March or later, in hopes that the eurozone economy will recover and inflation will rise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Golden Age", "Date": "2014-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWhat\u2019s going on here? Like almost everything concerning gold, the experts don\u2019t agree. Some have interpreted the metal\u2019s mini-comeback as an indication that financial Armageddon, in the guise of runaway inflation, is approaching. Others have read the recent moves as a symbolic way for central banks and governments to make a show of strength in nervously uncertain economic times. \u201cHolding gold, for people and for governments, reflects our anxieties about the future,\u201d said Michael Bordo, a professor of economics at Rutgers University who specializes in monetary history and policy. \u201cEven though it might seem somewhat retrograde, to many investors, having it on hand is something safe.\u201dAt a time when central banks around the globe have tried to foster growth by aggressively printing money \u2014 which can in theory devalue sovereign currencies \u2014 moves by countries to recall their stores of gold can help create a \u201cculture of stability,\u201d Professor Bordo said. But then again, to simply stockpile gold doesn\u2019t guarantee the health of an economy, and some analysts have said that such notions of stability are often more psychological than actual. The Swiss proposal, for example, called for the central bank to hold at least 20 percent of its national reserves in gold. While the referendum was designed in part to reassure Swiss citizens concerned about the solvency of their money, some historians have argued that, even had it passed, it would have had no palpable effect on the value of the franc. \u201cIt was mostly a symbolic move,\u201d said Richard Sylla, a professor of the history of financial markets and institutions at New York University. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t to say that it was crazy or unfounded. What the Swiss were really saying by considering the plan was that some of them were going to feel a whole lot better if they had tons of gold inside the bank.\u2019\u201d There remains the question of why gold has traditionally served as the economy\u2019s equivalent of comfort food. According to Professor Bordo, it is, for one thing, a highly liquid asset that is easily exchanged for other currencies. Furthermore, he added, when it was used as part of the gold standard, its controlled supply served to limit central banks from printing money and put a lid on profligate government spending.Needless to say, in an era when the balance sheets of many central banks have expanded to unprecedented scope, there has been plenty of discussion of those last two trends, causing a pessimistic sect of economic experts to augur pending doom in the repatriation schemes and the shopping sprees by Moscow and Beijing. Of course, not all economists have interpreted gold\u2019s resurgence as heralding a geopolitical disaster. To Joshua Aizenman, a professor of economics and international relations at the University of Southern California, dabbling in gold is mainly an attempt by bankers and officials to send a message to the world \u2014 one that signals an appetite for power or that broadcasts a desire to challenge a rival. \u201cI doubt that the Chinese or the Russians actually believe that gold is such a great investment in terms of pure returns,\u201d Professor Aizenman said. \u201cBut if they\u2019re trying to suggest that they\u2019re unhappy with the dollar or that they want to become a global player, then gold is very powerful. \u201cThe investment is a symbol,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s made for political, not financial, gain.\u201d A metropolitan reporter for The New York Times.

{"Headline": "China Invests in Region Rich in Oil, Coal and Also Strife", "Date": "2014-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe symbolism is telling. China is ramping up energy production here, turning the northwestern Xinjiang region into a national hub for oil, gas and coal, while the increasingly marginalized Uighur people are memorialized in what appears to be a bronze homage to a romantic past.\u201cLook at how much they\u2019re drilling,\u201d said Lu Weidong, the team leader of a half-dozen technicians in hard hats and oil-stained red coveralls working one recent morning on oil pumps in the desert here. \u201cHundreds of pumps are being built, and there are hundreds more behind those hills that you can\u2019t see.\u201dThe foundation of Xinjiang\u2019s energy economy is oil. Xinjiang has an estimated 21 billion tons of oil reserves, a fifth of China\u2019s total, and major new deposits are still being found. This month, a state-owned oil company announced its greatest discovery of the year here, a deposit estimated to have more than one billion tons of oil on the northwestern edge of the Dzungarian Basin, not far from Karamay\u2019s fields. Xinjiang is expected to produce 35 million tons of crude oil by 2020, a 23 percent increase over 2012, according to the Ministry of Land Resources.Xinjiang also has the country\u2019s largest coal reserves, an estimated 40 percent of the national total, and the largest natural gas reserves. Those three components form an energy hat trick that China is capitalizing on to power its cities and industries.Government money is flooding in. In May, Beijing said that 53 state-owned enterprises \u2014 from energy to construction to technology companies \u2014 were investing $300 billion in 685 projects in Xinjiang. The State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, announced in June that the Xinjiang government was investing $130 billion to build infrastructure such as roads, highways and railways.The main state-owned electric utility, the State Grid Corporation of China, is investing $2.3 billion over the next year to build high-voltage lines, according to People\u2019s Daily, the main party newspaper. Xinjiang will export electricity to more populated parts of China and perhaps to Central Asia.\u201cXinjiang is where all the growth in oil, gas and coal is going to be coming from,\u201d said Lin Boqiang, an energy scholar at Xiamen University and adviser at PetroChina, China\u2019s biggest oil producer. \u201cSecond, all the imported resources from Central Asia, oil and gas, go through Xinjiang and then get distributed from there.\u201dXinjiang produced 25 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2012, and it aims to increase that to 44 billion cubic meters next year.Regional officials are also pushing for the creation of a new source of gas: processing coal to create synthetic gas, which could then be transported east.At least 52 others across China are under construction or in the proposal stage, with nearly half in Xinjiang, according to a count in October by Greenpeace East Asia.Pollution is only one consequence of resource exploitation for the region\u2019s residents, a plurality of whom are Uighurs, a largely Muslim, Turkic-speaking population. The region\u2019s energy wealth flows mainly to the state-owned oil companies in Beijing and to the Communist Party, dominated by ethnic Han. Last year, Karamay \u2014 which means \u201cblack oil\u201d in the Uighur language and where, in 1955, China\u2019s first large oil field was discovered \u2014 had the highest per-capita gross domestic product of mainland Chinese cities.PetroChina\u2019s refinery here is the company\u2019s most profitable one, said Zhen Xinping, a senior engineer. It processes six million tons of oil per year.Though the government said it issued the rules in the name of security, many Uighurs see nothing but discrimination.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they have beards or veils,\u201d said one teenage girl in the Uighur farmers\u2019 shantytown at the edge of Karamay. \u201cThey\u2019re not bad people.\u201dThe residents say the government will soon demolish the area. The girl said she would like to stay in the city, though. \u201cKaramay has a lot of oil,\u201d she said, \u201cso I want to work here.\u201dJonah Kessel contributed reporting, and Mia Li contributed research.Advertisement"}

San Francisco has pop-up restaurants, art galleries and shops, but Ms. Cho\u2019s may be the first pop-up charity.Through social media, she has notified fans, who brought coats, pants, shirts, shoes, blankets and lots of socks as well as cash, which she gave away at each event. Her ninth and final performance was on Tuesday.She also did it because, she said pointedly, this city has become Dickensian, with the rich getting richer as they till the digital fields of Google and Facebook and the poor getting poorer and priced out of their apartments. Ms. Cho knows that she cannot change the economy, but she can lift spirits by doing what she knows best.\u201cSan Francisco used to be a city of street performers,\u201d Ms. Cho said at her final event. \u201cRobin was a street performer \u2014 this is part of bringing that back.\u201dOutside, drivers pulled up with armfuls of new sweaters, vests, jackets, pants, dental floss, soap and socks, stacking the donations on tables on the sidewalk. Homeless men and women, often unnoticed during the day, walked or biked to the tables and chose what they liked. Late into the night, the hills of clothing were replenished and the homeless kept coming. Michael Austin, \u201ceight years on the street,\u201d rode his clunky gray bicycle from under a nearby freeway overpass, where he lives. \u201cThis is exciting,\u201d he said, stuffing so much clothing into drooping plastic bags, marked \u201cPersonal Belongings Bag,\u201d that when he pedaled away the bike tipped over.

But Ms. Cho, 46, said her recent experiences had touched her heart. \u201cI hugged a man who told me, \u2018Don\u2019t you know, I haven\u2019t been touched in a year?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.\u201cYou\u2019d go to him if you needed money,\u201d Ms. Cho said. \u201cIf there was a foreclosure on your house, you asked Robin for help.

{"Headline": "Start-Ups Rise to Close a Gap for Farmers", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWELLESLEY, Mass. \u2014 In spite of the surging demand for locally and regionally grown foods over the last few years, there is a chasm separating small and midsize farmers from their local markets.The brainchild of Mark Jaffe, who previously organized tenants for bargaining purposes, the Fresh Connection expects to close this year with revenue of $270,000, up from just $5,300 when it started in 2012.\u201cIt\u2019s not sexy, but I like doing it,\u201d Mr. Jaffe said. \u201cWhen it got to be too much to fit in my car\u201d \u2014 a Toyota Matrix \u2014 \u201cI rented a refrigerated truck and it just took off from there.\u201dThe business now leases three such trucks and has four full-time and two part-time employees, and Mr. Jaffe hopes to secure financing that would help him add warehouse facilities so he could better manage delivery of perishables like eggs and chocolate.The Fair Food Network, a nonprofit organized to improve access to better food, recently held a second \u201cbusiness boot camp\u201d in Wellesley, Mass., for tiny companies working to increase ties between communities and local farmers, which culminated in a contest to win some $10,000.Over the last four or five decades, the American food system became dominated by larger and larger farms selling into highly integrated and centralized distribution programs aimed to serve big food companies, restaurants and national grocery chains.Then Whole Foods came along and demonstrated that there was money to be made in local agriculture. Not only did the upstart grocery company devote more of its floor space to produce and fresh meats, it distinguished itself from competitors by sourcing part of each store\u2019s merchandise from local vendors and using that distinction as a marketing advantage.As the business has grown, Fresh Direct has ramped up the support it gives farmers, Mr. McInerny said. Customers can click the word \u201clocal\u201d on the home page of the company\u2019s website and get to a page that allows them to order cheese, seafood, meat and other items sourced within 300 miles of their home.\u201cGreat farmers should be just that, great farmers, not necessarily great distributors,\u201d he said.The organization started out handling warehousing and distribution itself, but could never achieve the economies of scale it needed. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of refrigeration and logistics, which in turn required employee training and a lot of technology and other investment, and we asked ourselves whether that was really what we wanted to go to bed worrying about,\u201d said Michael Rozyne, Red Tomato\u2019s founder and co-director.About 40 percent of the final sales price goes to Red Tomato\u2019s farmers and 10 percent to the hub. That may sound generous, but Mr. Rozyne said there was constant pressure to improve efficiency and bring down prices to levels competitive with the broader commodity supply chain.Yet at the same time, he noted the number of start-ups involving stalwarts of the tech industry that are springing up to improve the connection between farmers and local markets. \u201cIt\u2019s almost scary how many of these things there are,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some pretty serious venture capital money flowing into this business.\u201dMr. Kaufman of Shibumi Farm uses FarmersWeb to connect to his customers, who can see what he has in stock, negotiate prices, arrange shipping and even pay using the system.FarmersWeb did the job for him, he said. \u201cA lot of these guys don\u2019t have time to be making sales calls \u2014 they\u2019re out raising pigs or kale,\u201d Mr. Navarrete said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t always have time to be taking calls from farms or their delivery services.\u201dNot all ways of improving consumer access to local and regional farm production involve distribution, however. Blue Ox Malthouse, for instance, is making malt from barley grown in Maine as a cover crop. Normally, farmers plow barley under or sell it cheaply for animal feed.Blue Ox has given them a new and more lucrative market, though, buying up barley and turning it into malt in hopes of selling it to Maine\u2019s thriving craft beer businesses.Most of the malt used in beer is made by two large companies, and Maine brewers are importing almost 76 million pounds of malt from them each year, according to Joel Alex, who founded Blue Ox last year.That means about $35 million that leaves the state, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s good for the farmers, who get a better price for a product they often just plowed under, and it\u2019s good for the craft beer business, where brewers are always looking for points of distinction,\u201d Mr. Alex said.He and Mr. Jaffe were among five participants in the boot camp at Babson College. The training was sponsored by the Fair Food Fund, a venture capital fund set up by the Fair Food Network to invest in what it calls \u201cthe missing middle,\u201d the infrastructure to connect small and midsize farms to the growing demand for their products.The participants had lessons in financial accounting, different types of financing, business models and other matters from Jay Friedlander, a senior fellow at Babson and founder of the sustainable business program at College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Me. They then pitched their businesses to a group of judges in hopes of winning $10,000 worth of consulting from experts who work with the Fair Food Fund.The plan is to bring into low-income neighborhoods nutritious meals that reflect cuisines like Caribbean, Cuban and Argentine, and are made from ingredients supplied by local farms. Cassandria Campbell, who grew up in such a neighborhood, Roxbury in Boston, got the idea after seeing a boy coming out of a fast-food restaurant who could barely walk because he was so overweight.\u201cI thought, How could his parents let him eat there?\u201d Ms. Campbell said. \u201cBut when I looked up and down the street, there weren\u2019t any better alternatives.\u201dThe catering business has taken off \u2014 Fresh Food Generation has provided meals at 20 events with a total of over 2,000 people in the last 10 months \u2014 but she and her co-founder, Jackson Renshaw, have struggled to get the other aspects of their business moving.\u201cWe are juggling getting the food truck going, the catering business and community outreach all at the same time,\u201d Mr. Renshaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging making our business model work because you\u2019re pulled in so many directions at once.\u201dThey plan to use their prize to get advice about how to set priorities and better manage their finances.An article on Wednesday about so-called food hubs that seek to connect local farmers with customers misstated the year that an online marketplace called FarmersWeb was founded. It started in 2012, not in 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Energy Efficiency May Be the Key to Saving Trillions", "Date": "2014-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBusiness of GreenCompared with eye-catching renewable power technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, energy efficiency is nearly invisible. But advocates say doing more with less power may be an even more critical weapon in the fight against climate change and offers big economic benefits, too.Worldwide, governments, companies and families could be saving trillions of dollars by improving efficiency with cars that go farther on less fuel and improved appliances, light bulbs and factories, experts say.Realizing those energy savings would be a huge boon to the climate, ease illness-causing air pollution, reduce many nations\u2019 reliance on fuel imports and increase competitiveness by lowering costs, the advocates say. It creates jobs in fields like upgrading buildings, and is generally cheaper than the alternative of constructing new power plants and buying more energy, they argue.But increasing efficiency is logistically complicated, requiring many individuals and organizations to take a tremendous number of small steps, and most nations have failed to aggressively pursue the potential savings.Some also argue that making energy cheaper by reducing demand just leads consumers to use more, a phenomenon called the rebound effect. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the effect was real but relatively modest, with about 20 percent of saved energy in developed countries being used as a result.The countries that have made the most progress on efficiency are those whose governments have prioritized it, Mr. Nadel said. Many are in Europe, where Germany, for example, requires regular efficiency audits of manufacturers and has stringent building codes, Ms. Young said.China has made major strides in recent years and ranks fourth on the efficiency scorecard.When Deng Xiaoping set his sights in the early 1980s on quadrupling economic output, China\u2019s leaders realized that, without dramatic efficiency improvements, it would depend heavily on imported energy, Mr. Sinton said.\u201cIt really takes persistence, and persistence is what has characterized the Chinese effort,\u201d he said. \u201cThey began to institutionalize energy efficiency, they allocated money to research and development, they started to set targets.\u201dWhile China still has wasteful factories and buildings, it also boasts some of the world\u2019s most efficient, he said.Efficiency will have to account for 40 percent of the emissions reductions if warming is to be limited to 2 degrees Celsius, as world leaders have pledged, Mr. Benoit said. That will cost $14 trillion between now and 2035, more than $600 billion a year, doubling the current rate of spending on efficiency, the agency estimates.Even during the 1970s crisis, the United States\u2019 focus on efficiency was less intent than many nations\u2019, said Mr. Nadel of the American efficiency council.Even so, America uses half the energy per dollar of gross domestic product that it did in the 1970s and has saved more than $15 trillion since then through rising efficiency, he said. Experts say that the use of more modern cars, appliances and equipment leads to efficiency improvements of more than 1 percent a year in developed countries, even without concerted effort.President Obama has sought to improve efficiency with measures like higher mileage standards for cars and proposed emissions cuts for power plants.Most companies can cut energy costs by between 10 percent and 20 percent with measures that pay for themselves within three years, he said. Some changes, like resetting heating systems and getting employees to turn off lights, bring big savings almost for free, he said. But, \u201cIt\u2019s one of these funny things: If it is so attractive financially, why aren\u2019t people doing it?\u201d he said.Lack of awareness, inertia and the small percentage of overall costs that energy represents for some businesses are all obstacles, he said.Commercial lending for building upgrades or appliance purchases is growing, Mr. Benoit said, often through programs that allow borrowers to make repayments through deductions from their energy bills.In poorer countries, increasing efficiency also makes it easier to provide power to those who lack it. When poor households switch to LED light bulbs, for example, \u201cyou\u2019re getting a lot more light and leaving enough electricity to do something else, have a fan, a cell phone charger,\u201d Mr. Sinton said.Despite up-front costs, advocates say efficiency measures are a bargain compared with other pieces of the puzzle. \u201cEnergy efficiency is the only energy that you could say is for free, where you get your money back,\u201d Mr. Verhaar said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s energy that you don\u2019t use.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Next Big Climate Question: Will India Follow China?", "Date": "2014-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTipping PointOne critical question now is whether India \u2014 the country that has stood by China\u2019s side in climate talks and is now the world\u2019s third-largest emitter \u2014 will follow suit in a meaningful way at the Lima negotiations. And there seems to be a surprisingly high chance that India will.China and India share a common domestic problem \u2014 one that has motivated China\u2019s leaders to act, and could motivate India\u2019s. That is, the fossil fuels that cause climate change also produce local air pollution. This has risen to deadly levels, with all of the Chinese and Indian cities that the World Health Organization monitors for air pollution failing the organization\u2019s test for acceptable levels of airborne particulate, widely believed to be the most dangerous air pollutant for human health. More than half of these cities also fail their own countries\u2019 particulates standards.The result is that China\u2019s policies to reduce particulates air pollution for the well-being of its people has been a part of, not counter to, its economic agenda. Moving away from coal and other fossil fuels also reduces the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, which has allowed China to confront two problems at once.India, like China, has a tremendous opportunity to improve the well-being of its citizens. If the regions of India that violate its own particulates air pollution standard were brought into compliance, the 660 million people currently living in these higher-pollution areas would see their life expectancy increase by an average of 3.2 years, for an overall gain of roughly two billion life years, according to our study. This action can in turn be part of India\u2019s economic strategy, contributing to a healthier, longer-working labor force and reduced medical bills.For years, climate negotiations have involved richer and poorer countries telling each other what they must or should do for the common good. I find it unlikely that American negotiators suddenly found the right words to persuade China to announce a new policy. Far more likely, an increasing awareness of the high levels of air pollution and its costs inside China caused the leadership to conclude that moving away from fossil fuels was in its own interest. Whatever the climate benefits for the planet, and they\u2019re potentially large, they are not driving China\u2019s decision.But results matters more than motives. If India follows China \u2014 and the countries make good on their pledges \u2014 it\u2019s possible that history books will ultimately judge this moment as a turning point when the world first collectively took meaningful actions to confront climate change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boehner Uses New Mandate to Muffle Talk of a Shutdown", "Date": "2014-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 John A. Boehner does not want to be remembered as the Shutdown Speaker.As Congress returns from recess on Monday facing a Dec. 11 deadline for funding the government, Mr. Boehner and his fellow Republican leaders are working to persuade the rank and file \u2014 furious over President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration \u2014 that engaging in a spending confrontation is the wrong way to counter the White House. That would set the wrong tone, they argue, as Republicans prepare to take over Congress and fulfill promises to govern responsibly.He made his views clear on Nov. 13, when House Republicans gathered in the Capitol for their first meeting since their emphatic sweep on Election Day. Representative Vicky Hartzler of Missouri posed the question on everyone\u2019s mind: How was the leader of the enlarged and emboldened House majority going to respond if Mr. Obama unilaterally eased the threat of deportation for millions of illegal immigrants?Mr. Boehner, according to those present, promised to fight the president \u201ctooth and nail.\u201d But he warned that the party members needed to coalesce around a strategy that gives them a stronger chance of success in combating Mr. Obama. Only Republicans, he said, would be blamed for a shutdown, just as they were last year.\u201cShutting down the entire government over something never did make sense to the American people, still doesn\u2019t and won\u2019t in the future,\u201d said Senator Richard M. Burr, a North Carolina Republican who is part of Mr. Boehner\u2019s inner circle. Like other Boehner insiders, he believes that the speaker, bolstered by election victories, is looking beyond the immediate fight.\u201cThere is certainly an opportunity for him to put his mark on the largest Republican House majority in a long time,\u201d Mr. Burr said. \u201cTo me, that is a big motivating factor.\u201dMr. Boehner\u2019s approaching third term as speaker holds both promise and peril.He is expected to be re-elected easily when the 114th Congress convenes on Jan. 6, unlike two years ago when a divided Republican conference embarrassed him with an uncomfortably close vote. This time his deputies are carefully counting their support, leaving nothing to chance.His majority \u2014 likely to be 247 seats after a few undecided races are settled \u2014 will be the largest any Republican speaker has had since 1929, so large that it is approaching the size that Democrats had in the 1960s when they solidified control of the House that endured for decades.But what he is able to do with that power will determine whether he is remembered as something more than the House leader during a stretch of frustrating gridlock and deep partisanship.\u201cHe\u2019s never wanted to just be speaker,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and a close ally. \u201cHe\u2019s wanted to be a historically significant speaker.\u201dA spending agreement would represent a significant victory for the party establishment over more conservative lawmakers and activists spoiling for a shutdown confrontation. It would also put his new House on a potential path to enacting the kinds of big legislation \u2014 on budgetary issues, tax reform and energy policy \u2014 that he envisions.Aides say that Mr. Boehner, who unsuccessfully pursued a grand budget deal with Mr. Obama but still oversaw significant federal spending reductions, would like to advance major legislation \u2014 but that the president\u2019s immigration move could prove a major obstacle.\u201cThe president\u2019s unilateral action on immigration will make every issue more difficult,\u201d said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, who declined through his office to be interviewed. \u201cWhile the speaker is never going to give up on pushing for tax and entitlement reform because it is the right thing to do for our economy, he is realistic about what can be accomplished with this president.\u201dDemocrats are skeptical that Mr. Boehner can deliver in the months ahead, based on what they saw as his refusal to stand up to his conference over the first shutdown and his inability to break any immigration legislation loose.\u201cHe always says he would like to do something more, but can\u2019t deliver,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee. \u201cI hope I am wrong, but I don\u2019t see that changing. He has more members, but the Tea Party still holds sway in his caucus.\u201dIf Mr. Boehner is able to mollify his right flank by pushing back hard enough against the president, he has good reason to believe his standing will remain strong heading into 2016. He has no obvious challengers from within his inner circle.In one of the less foreseeable twists of the Tea Party defeat of Eric Cantor, Mr. Boehner\u2019s former No. 2, the conservative forces that toppled Mr. Cantor actually helped the speaker strengthen the establishment\u2019s grip on House leadership.With the departure of Mr. Cantor, who was seen as a potential alternative if dissatisfaction with Mr. Boehner reached a boiling point, the speaker and his allies are no longer looking over their shoulders. They have reliable lieutenants in Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California as the new majority leader and Steve Scalise of Louisiana as the majority whip.Even the new head of the Republican Study Committee \u2014 the conservative bloc that bedeviled Mr. Boehner in the past \u2014 has indicated its members intend to be more cooperative and keep policy disagreements more private.\u201cOver the last several months I have seen us become a lot more cohesive than we have been in the past, and it is a good time to have that happen,\u201d said Representative Bill Flores, the Texan newly elected to head the group, adding that differences between leadership and rank-and-file conservatives had narrowed.This new tone \u2014 if it holds \u2014 is in large part by Mr. Boehner\u2019s own design. Beginning in January, Mr. Boehner will have more votes to spare because of the gain of a dozen seats in the midterm elections, allowing him a cushion to push through legislation even if he loses some conservatives.He personally campaigned for some of the new freshman members, working the Northeast particularly hard to elect Republicans he saw as more pragmatic who could balance the arrival of those on the far right.\u201cFor people who tend to underestimate John, this is a majority he grew,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker. \u201cHe now has his majority leader, his whip. He\u2019s raised an enormous amount of money. He deserves a lot of credit.\u201dMr. Boehner did 150 events for candidates across the country this year. He raised $102 million for this year\u2019s elections and transferred $23 million from his own political action committees to the National Republican Congressional Committee.Members of the House leadership said in interviews that they had begun laying the groundwork that they hoped would make the conference more manageable. But because Congress has not functioned as an orderly lawmaking body for so long, they find themselves having to educate members on the basics of legislating.Mr. Boehner\u2019s confidants say he appears more upbeat and assured than ever. Mr. Cole said he believed that the shutdown last year, as damaging as it was to Republicans, had only strengthened the speaker\u2019s hand because many of the more rebellious members came to see that he was right.Mr. Cole recalled a dinner with Mr. Boehner in the midst of the shutdown:\u201cI said to the speaker, \u2018Why in the world are we letting the guys who didn\u2019t vote for you drive the conference?\u2019 And you get that typical Boehner: \u2018Well, I learned a long time ago if you\u2019re a leader and nobody\u2019s following you, you\u2019re just a guy out for a walk.' \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Trade Chief, Undaunted by Odds, Pushes for Trans-Pacific Partnership", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe and his colleagues have clocked more than 1,500 meetings on Capitol Hill to promote the president\u2019s big potential trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 and still its prospects for passage look as problematic as ever.Having won over his White House colleagues and secured the backing of the president, Mr. Froman, now the United States trade representative, is convinced that he can complete negotiations on a complex trade agreement that has grown to encompass 12 countries on both sides of the Pacific, and sell it to a Congress that remains deeply hostile to Mr. Obama.\u201cThe endgame is a long game,\u201d Mr. Froman said in a recent interview, \u201cbut we\u2019re in that endgame.\u201dAt stake is a colossal trade agreement that would stretch from Peru and Chile to Japan and Vietnam, accounting for 40 percent of the world\u2019s economic activity. It would not just lower tariffs: The pact would require rigorous regulations on labor and environmental standards, as well as the first rules for state-owned enterprises like those run by the governments of Vietnam and Malaysia.The T.P.P. has emerged as the linchpin of Mr. Obama\u2019s strategic shift to Asia, giving the United States a way to counter the economic inroads made in the region by a rising China. The deal is supposed to be followed by the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with Europe, though those talks have much farther to go.A California-born lawyer who has known Mr. Obama since they were classmates at Harvard Law School, Mr. Froman, 52, exudes a genial charm. But it masks a relentless drive that propelled him from senior posts in the Clinton administration to a career at Citigroup, where he earned millions of dollars before resigning to join the Obama administration.Caroline Atkinson, his former deputy at the White House, describes his style as a \u201cNew York hand in a California glove.\u201d\u201cBoth bits are important,\u201d she said, noting that Mr. Froman was willing to walk away during the 11th hour of negotiations on a trade agreement with South Korea, even though Mr. Obama was then in Seoul, to extract better terms three weeks later.As the negotiations for T.P.P. have dragged on, missing multiple deadlines, Mr. Froman has expressed unwavering confidence in the outcome, saying the various parties are searching for \u201clanding zones\u201d on issues ranging from Japanese farm subsidies to Vietnamese labor regulations.Still, to members of Congress, both for and against expanded trade agreements, Mr. Obama\u2019s trade agenda has been waiting in the wings for so long that the promises of action are beginning to ring hollow. Efforts in the House and Senate to grant Mr. Obama trade promotion authority \u2014 once known as fast-track authority, and viewed as critical to passing major trade deals \u2014 have gone nowhere.Mr. Froman insists the political stars have aligned. Republican control of the Senate has elevated pro-trade lawmakers to key positions in leadership and committee control, and the international negotiations themselves have progressed.Over time, Mr. Portman said, those feelings might fade, especially if the president gets personally involved. \u201cThe president blew it by moving on immigration, but we can\u2019t let that distract us from everything else,\u201d he said.Democrats may be the bigger problem. Mr. Froman has met dozens of times with Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction on trade. And Mr. Levin said he wants to work with the administration on the T.P.P., down to the finest details.But he said he was not about to allow Mr. Obama to negotiate the partnership on his own, then present it to Congress for an up-or-down vote with no opportunity to change it. And Mr. Levin\u2019s stature and seniority command respect in the House Democratic Caucus.\u201cYou\u2019re asking members to give away their leverage on a historic trade agreement when there are major issues outstanding,\u201d Mr. Levin said, suggesting that a vote on trade promotion authority before the presentation of a completed T.P.P. \u201cwould be a donnybrook.\u201dSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee in the coming Congress, is one of the strongest trade advocates in Washington; he said virtually no Democrat who had supported trade promotion authority in the past would be left in the Senate next year.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big challenge,\u201d he said.Then there are the details. Environmental groups are doubtful the administration is really pressing for binding, enforceable standards. Peru is already resisting enforcement mechanisms to rein in illegal logging.Trade unions worry that the administration is putting too much emphasis on protecting intellectual property, a boon to pharmaceutical companies, Hollywood and rich investors, but not particularly useful to workers at home or poor consumers abroad.And skeptics from both parties are pressing Mr. Froman to demand enforceable limits on currency manipulation, which they say inflates the value of the dollar, making American products artificially expensive and imports artificially cheap. The result is a wider trade deficit that costs jobs at home.About 230 House members and 60 senators have signed letters demanding enforceable sanctions on currency manipulators, the part of the negotiations that has given the White House the most pause.Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and a consultant to American unions monitoring trade talks, said strong currency provisions would do more to promote middle-class manufacturing jobs than any other provisions, including lowering tariff barriers on American goods.\u201cThe value of the dollar swamps everything else,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cThe dollar is central.\u201dAdministration officials worry that any enforceable currency regime will cut both ways. They say it could even infringe on the Federal Reserve, making it subject to an international tribunal.On the broader concerns of reluctant Democratic senators like Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mr. Froman pointed to the 18 cases of alleged unfair trade practices the administration has brought before the World Trade Organization, half of them against China, as proof that Mr. Obama can be trusted to watch out for the interests of American workers.For Mr. Froman, success would cement a bond with Mr. Obama that began at law school, where both were a few years older than most of their classmates \u2014 a distinction, one recalled, that gave them a more worldly aura.Cabinet secretaries have divided up members of Congress to press them individually.\u201cMike Froman, he\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Representative Dave Reichert, Republican of Washington, who has formed the Friends of T.P.P. with a small, bipartisan and regionally diverse group of four representatives.But even Mr. Reichert said all that attention from the administration was not enough. Mr. Obama has to get involved personally. The Friends of T.P.P. wrote a letter earlier this month requesting a meeting with the president, Mr. Reichert said. They have had no response.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Wall Street Bent Steel ", "Date": "2014-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 PhotosThe chain of events that\u2019s put everyone in Canton, Ohio, on edge, from steelworkers and machine tool makers to the school superintendent and, above all, the scion who runs this small city\u2019s biggest company, started with a few keystrokes 2,400 miles away in a bland suburban office building in San Diego. Throughout the summer and fall of 2012, Relational\u2019s traders in San Diego quietly accumulated shares, and by November, the firm owned nearly 6 percent of Timken. Relational is not a typical buy-and-hold shop. On Wall Street, it is what\u2019s known as an activist investor, one of a number of increasingly powerful firms that acquire big stakes in companies and pressure executives to make changes to \u201cunlock value\u201d and drive share prices higher.After focusing on smaller companies with dysfunctional management and languishing shares, activist investors are now taking on some of the most prominent \u2014 and successful \u2014 giants, including DuPont, Amgen, Procter & Gamble, eBay, and even Apple, the single most valuable American company. As a result, they\u2019ve become something of a boogeyman in corporate boardrooms, pushing for bigger buybacks, fatter dividends and sometimes new chief executives. In the case of Timken, the activists demanded the breakup of the company. And last summer, after a contentious public fight and a shareholder vote, Timken relented, splitting itself into two companies, one focused on bearings, the other on steel. Although that lifted Timken\u2019s shares and handed Relational a handsome profit, the split has left the resulting businesses much more vulnerable to a takeover \u2014 which explains why people in Canton are so jittery about the future. Sitting at Bender\u2019s Tavern, a 112-year-old fixture of downtown Canton in September, Mr. Timken, 47, was by turns feisty about keeping the steel company independent and resigned to the formidable challenge he faces. \u201cEverybody\u2019s sitting there on the sideline saying, \u2018Who\u2019s going to pick these guys off?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Timken said of the possibility of a buyout. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let that happen. I\u2019m going to grow this business and it\u2019s going to be reflected in the share price. If I can do that right, then we earn our independence.\u201d If he can\u2019t, or if another company comes along with an offer too rich to refuse, Mr. Timken acknowledges what many in Canton would rather not say out loud. \u201cIf the number is big enough, the board is going to have to look at it and say, \u2018Ugh, O.K., unless you can show me a plan that\u2019s better than that, we\u2019re going to take it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a publicly traded company.\u201d As in all publicly traded companies, TimkenSteel\u2019s board and top executives have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to maximize both profits and investor returns. For many companies in the region, that has meant cutting costs and moving production to places where labor is cheaper. Goodyear Tire & Rubber, for example, was founded in nearby Akron in 1898, but Goodyear hasn\u2019t made regular tires in the onetime rubber capital of the world in more than three decades.Timken briefly resorted to layoffs during the 2009 recession, but the company has been loyal to Canton. In the early 1980s, during a deep recession, Timken spent $450 million to build a state-of-the-art mill on the edge of town. More recently, the company spent $225 million to expand that steel mill and erect a giant caster, the only one of its kind in North America and one of only a handful anywhere in the world. Rising 17 stories above the surrounding cornfields with another eight below ground, the Jumbo Bloom Vertical Caster, as it\u2019s formally known, can turn molten metal into fresh steel more quickly and at a lower cost. In October, it began making steel that will eventually end up as pipelines on deep-sea rigs, or as gun barrels or precision medical tools.The Timken family supported these huge capital expenditures even though it meant lower profits in the short term and less capital to return to shareholders. The wager in the 1980s paid off in the long run, allowing Timken to innovate, dominate the market for high-margin, specialized steel, and stay ahead of rivals in South Korea, Japan and Germany. A chunk of the resulting profits has been poured back into Canton, a city of 70,000, in the form of good wages for unionized steelworkers or donations to local schools, the Canton Museum of Art, and the new downtown arts district. These efforts have largely spared Canton the fate of Youngstown, another Ohio steel town that is only now beginning to recover from 40 years of what economists politely term deindustrialization.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what Canton would be like without the Timkens,\u201d said Kevin Dougherty, owner of the Industrial Tool Company, a Timken supplier. \u201cI hope they maintain control, but it\u2019s wait and see. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find somebody here that wasn\u2019t provided for by that company.\u201d Adrian E. Allison, the superintendent of the Canton City School District, has a pretty good idea what it would mean if the Timken companies were sold. His mother worked for 30 years making vacuums at the Hoover factory in North Canton. That iconic company was sold by the Hoover family in the 1980s, beginning a long corporate odyssey through Maytag, Whirlpool and finally a Hong Kong company that closed the plant in 2007, sending the jobs to Mexico and China.\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate concern within the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the family left, the fear is it would end up like Hoover did.\u201d  Old-School CapitalistsTim Timken is not a bleeding heart liberal. He has no plans to redistribute his vast wealth, including more than $28 million worth of stock in Timken and TimkenSteel. In fact, in the three years before the company\u2019s split, as chairman but not chief executive, Mr. Timken was paid a total of nearly $25 million \u2014 a sum that became a flash point in the fight with the activist investors. Like most of his family members, he\u2019s a staunch Republican. He joined other wealthy donors at a fund-raiser for Mitt Romney at Brookside Country Club in Canton in the summer of 2012. His uncle and predecessor as chairman, William Robert Timken Jr., supported George W. Bush and was rewarded with an ambassadorship to Germany.The Timkens\u2019 brand of conservatism, however, embraces a community-minded version of corporate capitalism that is fading in the United States. There have been tough negotiations with the United Steelworkers union and the occasional strike, but the company generally avoided lockouts or other efforts to crush the union. Base salaries for unionized employees average $23 an hour, higher than at any of Timken\u2019s specialty-steel rivals, and workers receive the equivalent of another $20 an hour in benefits \u2014 in some cases bringing the total compensation to roughly $90,000 a year with overtime. When it came to the business, the Timkens eschewed excessive borrowing. Huge stock buybacks to inflate share prices were dismissed as financial engineering. And though the Timkens have always paid themselves generously, conspicuous spending was frowned upon. \u201cWe don\u2019t drive Bentleys and fly around,\u201d said Mr. Timken, who spent summers as a teenager walking the floor of the steel mill. Everything about his appearance at Bender\u2019s Tavern reinforced that statement. He was dressed in jeans, a white dress shirt and a blazer, his salt-and-pepper beard fashionably trim. He might have been mistaken for an engineer building TimkenSteel\u2019s new vertical caster or the owner of one of the small tool-and-die makers that supply his company, not a Fortune 500 C.E.O.Mr. Timken\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Henry Timken, a carriage maker, moved his bearing business to Canton from St. Louis in 1901, anticipating the growth of the auto industry. Canton was midway between the steel mills of Pittsburgh, which supplied the raw material for bearings, and the Detroit automakers, which bought them. For Tim Timken, making things still matters. In business school at the University of Virginia in the early 1990s, one of his professors suggested that manufacturing wasn\u2019t really relevant to the American economy anymore, that banking and health care would be the future. It was a defining moment for Mr. Timken. \u201cThe professor said we\u2019d all be bankers and consultants and lawyers and health care professionals,\u201d Mr. Timken recalled. \u201cThere\u2019s a role for those people, but the ripple effect of manufacturing is dramatically higher than the ripple effect of banking. It creates wealth. And countries that have let it slip away have suffered.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been 115 years and we\u2019re still here,\u201d he added of the family business. \u201cWe never went bankrupt, never sold out and I feel a personal obligation to continue it.\u201d Other steel businesses did go belly up. Many industry executives blame unions and dumping by Asian competitors for their troubles, but Mr. Timken asserts that lack of investment and innovation, along with heavy borrowing, contributed mightily to their demise. While the steel industry may not seem high-tech, research and innovation is critical \u2014 about a third of the products TimkenSteel sells now were developed only in the last five years.The steel business is also notoriously cyclical, which is one reason Mr. Timken is wary of borrowing heavily. He prefers to have a cash cushion to sustain product development and new investments during the inevitable lean years. \u201cWe will use our balance sheet but we\u2019re going to do that in a responsible manner,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we do it.\u201d But that is not the way activist investors see it. They tend to be more comfortable with debt, whether to make acquisitions or to increase dividends and finance large-scale stock buybacks. In fact, Relational\u2019s model for a broken-up Timken suggested the two resulting pieces could afford to take on just over $1 billion in fresh debt.Buybacks and increased leverage on the balance sheet can work fine in some sectors. But they can be lethal in industries that require long-term thinking and big investments to stay competitive, like heavy industry and health care, according to Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor and a critic of many activist tactics. \u201cActivists think long term is 12 months and the first thing that goes is the stuff that pays off in five or 10 years,\u201d said Mr. George, who is the former chief executive of Medtronic, the medical device company. \u201cAmerica\u2019s strength isn\u2019t from low labor costs. It\u2019s from research and development and capital investment.\u201d Smaller business owners in Canton, like Sam Wilkof of Stark Industrial, worry that the same qualities that helped Timken survive and innovate are now viewed as liabilities by hedge funds and activist investors. \u201cI know Tim and I\u2019ve known the family my whole life,\u201d he said. Stark Industrial was founded by Mr. Wilkof\u2019s father in 1959, and it has grown alongside Timken. \u201cThey\u2019re smart \u2014 they should be given the latitude to do what they need to do.\u201d \u201cTimken and Canton are pretty synonymous,\u201d Mr. Allison said. \u201cThey are the cornerstone of the community.\u201d In fact, the Timken Foundation built Timken High School in the late 1930s. The foundation poured $10 million into the school from 1997 to 2002 after graduation rates plunged. The district used the money to pay for new math and science programs as well as to renovate the campus.Some on Wall Street say that the Timken commitment to Canton makes it harder for management to do the kind of cost-cutting Relational and other activists favor. \u201cWhen your name is on the street outside headquarters, or on the high school,\u201d said Stephen Volkmann, an analyst at Jefferies, \u201cit\u2019s hard to be the bad guy.\u201d\u2018It Was a Nail-Biter\u2019 The tale of Timken and the activist investors might seem like a Michael Moore-style good guy/bad guy narrative of Wall Street greed. But the players in this drama are not black-and-white caricatures. The reality is more nuanced and reveals the pressures executives and money managers, not just workers and residents in local communities, face in today\u2019s economy. Relational wasn\u2019t the only investor to take on Timken. Its partner from early on was the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, known as Calstrs. One of the nation\u2019s largest public pension funds, with $187 billion in assets, Calstrs owned only $16 million worth of Timken stock at the start of the fight, compared with $250 million for Relational, but it also has more than a billion dollars under management with Relational. A higher return on its Timken shares would help meet $11.45 billion in annual payments that are due to more than 236,000 teachers and other retirees. Relational had experience pressuring old-line industrial companies to change their ways. The firm was founded in 1996 by Ralph V. Whitworth and David H. Batchelder, who first made their reputations working for T. Boone Pickens, the corporate raider. But Timken was a risky target for Relational\u2019s executives: They could be painted as Gordon Gekko types trying to make a fast buck by attacking a well-regarded, family-run company that had outperformed the stock market. Getting Calstrs on board helped neutralize that threat. The pension fund, long a champion of better corporate governance, made the case that Timken\u2019s board was dominated by family members who paid themselves liberally and put their own interests ahead of shareholders\u2019 interests. It argued for more independent board members \u2014 a fundamental principle of the shareholder rights movement \u2014 and noted that nine out of the 12 board members were from Ohio. In the summer of 2012, Mr. Batchelder traveled to Canton and presented the case to Timken executives. Relational had often been able to get its way without a messy public fight, as had Calstrs. But Timken\u2019s response was different. Summer turned to fall with no signal from Timken that it would shift its structure or strategy. Relational and Calstrs kept acquiring shares, eventually reaching the 5 percent threshold that required a public filing. Soon both Relational and Calstrs as well as Timken were fighting it out in public, producing slick presentations and setting up rival websites (unlocktimken.com and timkendrivesvalue.com) ahead of a shareholder vote on the breakup proposal. \u201cIt was run in a campaign style, almost,\u201d said Philip Larrieu, an investment officer at Calstrs. \u201cRelational had done it before and they had the infrastructure to do it. We\u2019d never done that kind of contest.\u201d The heart of the Calstrs/Relational argument was that the two companies should trade as pure plays, with investors deciding for themselves whether to bet on the faster-growing but more volatile steel business or the more mature but highly profitable bearing business. Timken executives fought back, making the case for keeping bearings and steel under one roof. Bearings require specialized steel that can, for example, withstand enormous pressure deep underwater in an offshore oil well. The metallurgical expertise the steel unit acquired in creating these advanced materials, they said, translated into products for other customers like medical device makers and drillers.There were other structural reasons for the two companies to stay together. Because the steel business can be very profitable but is much more volatile, the bearings division served as ballast for the combined company. Excess cash from the bearing side smoothed out those peaks and valleys and helped pay for big investments like the huge caster. But Mr. Larrieu and Relational maintained that if the money couldn\u2019t be invested in the business now or in the foreseeable future, it should be returned to shareholders, who are, after all, the owners of the company.With the Timken family, foundation and employees controlling roughly 20 percent of the shares, Relational and Calstrs had to capture the support of about two-thirds of other shareholders. In April, with the vote three weeks away, Calstrs and Relational put out a news release calling Tim Timken\u2019s $9 million pay package in 2011 \u201cgrossly out-of-line with other executive chairmen in Timken\u2019s peer group.\u201d Not voting for their proposal, the activists said, would mean \u201cthe Timken family-dominated board can continue to perpetuate a business structure that apparently only serves their interests.\u201dMr. Larrieu joined the roadshow organized for investors by Relational, flying to New York to meet fellow pension fund managers and press for a breakup. \u201cIt was a nail-biter,\u201d said Mr. Larrieu. The activists prevailed. In the end, 53 percent of shareholders favored the split. The vote was nonbinding, but in the meantime, analysts at Jefferies were calling Timken \u201ca reasonable leveraged buyout candidate\u201d and rating potential buyers. Faced with these alternatives, in September 2013, Timken\u2019s board voted to spin off the steel business to shareholders. It had been a little more than a year since Relational began accumulating shares. The split has only heightened Wall Street\u2019s eagerness to see a buyout. Rating the stock a buy, Jefferies said, \u201cAcquisition interest likely high; potential acquirers plentiful, though TMST not looking to sell cheap,\u201d the day before it began trading. Analysts at Gabelli & Company reached a similar conclusion. \u201cWe believe an acquisition has better than even odds one to two years out,\u201d the firm said in a report weeks later. That TimkenSteel had little debt and an overfunded pension plan at the time of the spinoff, Gabelli added, makes its balance sheet \u201cripe for a sale.\u201d In the looking-glass world of Wall Street, the Timken family\u2019s conservative approach to running the company has made it an appealing target for giant rivals or private equity firms \u2014 even though those buyers might ultimately undermine the very strategy that made it successful in the first place.TimkenSteel\u2019s market capitalization is less than a tenth of that of Nucor, which is now the country\u2019s biggest steel producer. If TimkenSteel is swallowed by a larger competitor, like Nucor, ArcelorMittal or United States Steel, the mills in Canton won\u2019t grind to a halt anytime soon. But an owner from another state \u2014 or country \u2014 is unlikely to be so committed to keeping jobs in Canton, let alone backing a downtown arts district or local high school. Before the vote to split, Calstrs and Relational said the \u201csocial impact\u201d of the separation would be \u201cinsignificant.\u201d As for the possibility of a buyout now, \u201cI\u2019m not sure it could be taken out without the Timkens\u2019 approval, but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s not possible,\u201d Mr. Larrieu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough environment. But my job is to make the highest return to pay for the teachers\u2019 retirement.\u201d Relational, which declined to comment on the record, earned a big payday from the spinoff but won\u2019t be worrying about what happens in Canton. By the fall, the San Diego activist firm had unloaded its entire position in both Timken and TimkenSteel. All told, Relational acquired its stake at about $40 a share and sold at $70, reaping a 75 percent gain \u2014 $188 million \u2014 in just over two years. Although Mr. Timken is on the board of the new bearing company, its chief executive is not a family member. And the new management seems to be hewing more closely to the activists\u2019 playbook. Even if TimkenSteel and Timken manage to avoid a takeover for the time being, the separation is likely to make both firms more vulnerable over time, said Suzanne Berger, a professor of political science at M.I.T. who researches globalization, innovation and production.Not only will they both be less financially nimble than before, she said, the steel maker in particular will lack the scale to invest and innovate the way it could under the old corporate structure. Foreign steel makers in Asia and Europe are vastly larger, and face much less pressure for short-term results, enabling them to pour more money back into their businesses. \u201cIn the microcosm of Timken, you can see the larger forces playing out in manufacturing in America,\u201d said Ms. Berger, who studied the company for a 2013 book she wrote, \u201cMaking in America.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not classic greed, like \u2018Barbarians at the Gate.\u2019 But we\u2019ve set up financial markets in a way that\u2019s injurious to long-term investment and industrial companies.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a financial system in the U.S.,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere California teachers have to protect their pension funds by hurting manufacturing in Ohio.\u201dSigns of Things to Come? In the spring and early summer of 2014, as Timken and TimkenSteel prepared to split, an omen appeared down the road from TimkenSteel\u2019s headquarters. Five striking members of the steelworkers union were camped out in a plywood shack covered with blue tarpaulin. They\u2019d been locked out of PSC Metals\u2019 scrapyard in Canton, which is a supplier to Timken. Once upon a time, this scrapyard was owned by the local Luntz family, but in 1997 it was bought by a publicly traded Canadian company, Philip Services. In the next decade, Philip Services went bankrupt twice, and what ultimately became PSC Metals ended up in the hands of Carl C. Icahn, the former corporate raider of the 1980s who has rebranded himself as an activist investor.Mr. Icahn is worth more than $20 billion, but two months before the contract for PSC\u2019s union workers was scheduled to expire in late 2013, management told them that it was dropping their health insurance benefits and that they would have to buy their own insurance through the new exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act. PSC\u2019s website says, \u201cOur people are our greatest asset,\u201d but when union members rejected the new terms, they were locked out, even though they told PSC that they were willing to work under the old contract and negotiate in the meantime.\u201cThey weren\u2019t negotiating. It was take it or leave it,\u201d said Jeff Bryant, who has worked at the yard for 35 years. Although the company would save thousands of dollars a year by shifting the cost of health insurance to its employees, workers were initially offered a new contract with a wage freeze in the first two years and then a 15-cent-an-hour raise in the third year. \u201cHealth insurance for a family can cost 10 grand,\u201d Mr. Bryant said. \u201cWere we supposed to pull that out of thin air?\u201d The union workers were locked out on Feb. 1; shortly before their unemployment benefits were scheduled to run out, in midsummer, PSC made an offer they couldn\u2019t afford to turn down. Returning workers would get a one-time payment of $9,000 but would have to pay the full cost of health insurance in the future. Average wages would go from about $18 an hour to just over $19 an hour over three years.Ron Kline, the chief executive of PSC Metals, which operates 48 facilities in the United States, said the decline of the industry and PSC made cuts necessary. \u201cWe have borrowed over $206 million from our parent, Icahn Enterprises, in order to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe eliminated health care coverage and the associated costs for the sake of our company\u2019s survival, including the continued employment of our 1,000 employees.\u201dThe days of middle-class blue-collar jobs are endangered in Canton. But the nostalgia remains. \u201cIf I could do anything that could make it go back to the Luntzes, I would,\u201d said another worker, Al Street, who earned a diploma from Timken High School before going to work for the Luntzes in the scrapyard 20 years ago. \u201cYou knew who your boss was and they knew your name and they cared.\u201d Indeed, Drew Luntz, a member of the family that once owned PSC, now finds himself worried about what the future holds for Timken and Canton. \u201cThe Timkens are resourceful and brilliant, but the reality is that a unique $1.5 billion business could be a plum for somebody.\u201d The clock is ticking. TimkenSteel\u2019s stock has dropped to $32.72 from $49 in September, reflecting fears that lower oil prices will mean less demand for specialty steel from the energy industry. Its market capitalization is less than a third of the old combined Timken. And in the Manhattan aerie of a private equity firm or the Greenwich offices of a hedge fund, a young analyst is most likely running the numbers to find out how much it would cost to force Tim Timken\u2019s hand and scoop the company up.

Are they disabled, ill, in school, taking care of house or family, in retirement, or something else? Here are the trends within some of the larger of those categories: SchoolAbout 13 percent of the increase in prime-age nonworkers, including a substantial fraction of the younger ones, comes among people who say they are in school.Taking care of home or familyMen who identify as homemakers remain relatively rare, but they are about twice as common as they were in 2000.DisabilityAbout 20 percent of the new nonworkers say they are disabled, a category whose numbers have risen particularly for workers above age 50.RetirementAmong prime-age workers, early retirement has increased slightly since 2000. Far more drastic changes have occured among workers 55 and older, who have been doing the opposite and putting off retirement.Even if this is the case, though, the rise of elderly employment in recent years has not provided enough of a lift to put more young people back to work.Across the country, 16 percent of prime-age men are not working.

{"Headline": "Misreading the Lessons From Financial Crises", "Date": "2014-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low Finance\u201cThere are good crises and there are bad crises. Every crisis breaks a deadlock and sets events in motion. It is either a disaster or an opportunity. A bad crisis is one in which no one has the power to make good use of the opportunity and therefore it ends in disaster. A good crisis is one in which the power and the will to seize the opportunity are in being. Out of such a crisis come solutions.\u201d\u2014 Walter Lippmann, March 7, 1933The world has experienced one financial crisis after another over the last few decades \u2014 runaway inflation, the stock market crash of 1987, the East Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the popping of the dot-com bubble in the face of accounting scandals and, finally, the crisis that led to the Great Recession.And yet, at least according to the stock market, these have been the golden years. Never have United States stock prices done so well during a 36-year period as they have since 1978.That one fact is an indication that the world has, on balance, handled the crises well enough \u2014 or at least that investors now believe that to be true. This column, which will conclude next week as I end a 26-year career at The New York Times, is an attempt to evaluate those crises and how they were sometimes misunderstood in ways that came back to haunt the world years later. Inflation was the big crisis of the late 1970s, when I first began to write about markets and the economy. Its persistence discredited economists and governments. It drained faith in the American economy.In 1979, Business Week published an article that was destined to become a classic example of how wrong journalists could be: \u201cThe Death of Equities,\u201d the cover proclaimed. \u201cHow inflation is destroying the stock market.\u201d Betting on continuing inflation, through gold and silver prices, became popular. Long-term bonds became known as \u201ccertificates of confiscation\u201d because investors were sure to be losers. The upward march of oil prices was viewed as a sure thing.Inflation was vanquished by Paul Volcker, who was appointed Federal Reserve chairman in 1979 and showed a single-minded determination to conquer it. He did that largely by raising interest rates to levels previously unthinkable. Not since the Civil War \u2014 when the country\u2019s very survival was in question \u2014 had the federal government paid as much as 10 percent to borrow money. Before Mr. Volcker was through, the government would pay more than 15 percent, and there would be back-to-back recessions in the early 1980s.Mr. Volcker was not tremendously popular at the time \u2014 starting recessions is not a surefire strategy to improve poll ratings \u2014 but in the aftermath he deservedly became a legend. The crisis was solved. The stock market took off in late 1982, and interest rates soon began to fall. But like many solutions, the victory created other problems. It helped to destroy the savings and loan business, which was based on taking in short-term deposits and lending out the money for 30-year mortgages. The shadow banking system \u2014 largely exempt from normal banking regulation \u2014 filled the breach when interest rates rose above the levels that banks were allowed to pay.More than 20 years later, the world would have good reason to regret that so much financial activity was no longer regulated. But at the time, what was clear was that the central bank had solved a problem that the politicians were said to have created. Around the world, there was a trend to independence for central bankers, whose brilliance was taken for granted. Mr. Volcker\u2019s aura carried over to his successor, Alan Greenspan, who in his first days in office was confronted with a crisis that shook the world\u2019s financial markets. The great 1980s bull market came to an abrupt end on Oct. 19, 1987 \u2014 known instantly as Black Monday \u2014 when the Dow Jones industrial average lost 22 percent of its value in one day. The immediate reaction was fear that the crash signaled a new recession, or worse. Mr. Greenspan responded by opening the monetary spigots, assuring that battered brokerage firms would have access to cash. There was no recession, and by late 1989 stock prices returned to setting records.The lessons learned from that crisis were generally the wrong ones, or at least they turned out to be counterproductive. The first was that prompt monetary easing would rescue any situation. The Fed had not done that immediately after the 1929 crash, and disaster ensued. But it had done so in 1987, and all turned out fine. The central bank had saved the day. For many investors, the lesson learned was that rapid declines in stock prices created buying opportunities. Regulators and investors might have done better to ponder why the crash had happened at all. There had been speculation driving share prices to perhaps unsustainable levels, but that speculation had not been nearly as widespread as in 1929. What had become different was the markets themselves. A primary cause of the decline was the widespread popularity of \u201cportfolio insurance,\u201d an idea developed largely by academics at the University of California. The idea was that a money manager need not trouble himself \u2014 in those days, there were few women managing large sums of money \u2014 with worries that the market was becoming overheated.Instead, managers could simply use stock index futures to reduce a portfolio\u2019s exposure to the stock market. If stock prices began to decline, selling some futures would reduce the risk. If they fell further, all the managers had to do was sell more futures. In that way nearly all the profits from the bull market could be protected.That strategy assumed that the stock index futures market would remain liquid \u2014 that someone else would buy the futures if panic struck. Instead, the futures exchange market makers who bought the first futures sold by the managers turned around and sold stocks to protect themselves. That drove prices down more and ignited more selling of futures. Everybody could not get out at the same time.What might have been learned? That new regulatory mechanisms were needed. Markets were very different from even a few years earlier, involving products that were complicated and used primarily, if not exclusively, by large financial firms. Computers had become fast enough to automatically issue trade orders \u2014 and had done so by pushing out orders to sell stock index futures even when it should have been clear those orders were only making the crisis worse. Had that been learned, some of the disasters of recent years might have been averted, including the 2010 \u201cflash crash,\u201d in which badly programmed computers combined with badly designed markets to drive some high-quality stocks down to $1 a share.But what was learned was that the Fed could, and would, rescue Wall Street if markets got out of hand, and that it could be relied upon to do so. Mr. Greenspan became an oracle, one who preached the wisdom of markets while standing ready to clean up any messes they made. That became known as the \u201cGreenspan put:\u201d You could make money when prices rose and avoid severe losses because he would step in if they fell.It carried the seeds of its own demise, but that would not become clear until 2008.Next week: Markets go from being worshiped to feared.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Board Backs Casinos in the Catskills, Near Albany and in Central New York", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe resorts, which would include boutique hotels, spas, luxury restaurants, golf resorts and other amenities, are expected to provide thousands of jobs in distressed parts of the state and, according to one estimate, generate over $300 million in new tax revenues.But New York is entering an intensively competitive gambling industry in the Northeast with lagging returns that some analysts believe is close to saturated. The Gaming Facility Location Board seemed to take that into account by declining to recommend a fourth resort, as allowed by law, in part to give the other three a better chance of success. It also rejected six applications in Orange County, the region closest to New York City, in favor of a single resort in neighboring Sullivan County, to the north, citing the need for economic development.For advocates, the announcement on Wednesday was a cause for celebration, after years of intense lobbying for full-scale gambling as a salve for economic woes in the long-faded Catskills. \u201cFor 50 years, the Sullivan County Catskills have sought gaming as a way to grow our tourism-based economy,\u201d said State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican whose district includes much of the Catskills. \u201cAnd now that moment is here.\u201dSeveral major developers \u2014 including Caesars Entertainment, Hard Rock and Mohegan Sun \u2014 were shut out, as were several more modest proposals; 16 applicants had sought casino licenses. New York is already home to five tribal casinos upstate and nine slot parlors at racetracks. Still, economists, analysts and some developers expect that casinos closer to New York City, and its 52 million annual visitors, could be successful, at least for a while. \u201cThe risk is all on the private sector and we have only upside,\u201d he said. Perhaps the biggest winner in the casino sweepstakes was the Genting Group, which hired a small army of lobbyists and public relations personnel and was a major contributor to the Committee to Save New York, a now-defunct business coalition that supported Mr. Cuomo\u2019s first term agenda. Already a major casino operator in Asia and England, Genting owns the sole gambling hall in New York City, the Resorts World slot parlor at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, which is the highest grossing gambling operation in the United States. The family of the chairman of the Genting Group has a controlling stake in Empire Resorts.On Wednesday, two of the company\u2019s proposals in Orange County were rejected, but by winning the license for Montreign in the Catskills, Genting will have both the largest casino in New York and the one closest to New York City.Kevin Law, the chairman of the location board, emphasized that the siting process had been free of outside interference, saying the decision had been influenced by many factors: economic effects, financing, community support and the so-called speed to market, or how fast they could open. Local casinos would also capture dollars now spent by New York gamblers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, Mr. Law said, echoing one of the governor\u2019s promises. The casinos are expected to open in early 2017, if not sooner.The recommended developers still must be approved by the State Gaming Commission and pass a background check by the State Police, and the projects must undergo environmental reviews.Under state law, the new operators will have to pay a one-time licensing fee of $20 million to $70 million, depending on the location. Location will also determine the tax rate on gambling revenues, from 37 percent to 45 percent for slot machines and 10 percent for table games. The bulk of the revenue, 80 percent, is earmarked for elementary and secondary education or property tax relief, with the remaining money split between municipal and county governments.On Wednesday, opponents who had fought casinos celebrated the outcome. \u201cI think we had a lot to do with it,\u201d said Cara Benson, a spokeswoman for the group, Save East Greenbush, which opposed a casino just east of Albany. \u201cMr. Law came back and said to me, \u2018We really listened to you and we really took your concerns into consideration.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAt the Miss Monticello diner in Monticello, patrons said the Montreign casino in nearby Thompson would bring jobs and tourists. \u201cYou\u2019re going to draw the people,\u201d Ted Kocijanski, 80, said, \u201cwho still have the money to do that.\u201dAn earlier version of a headline that appeared on the home page with this article misstated the location for one the the casinos approved by a New York State board. It is the Finger Lakes region, not Albany.Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about a recommendation by a New York State board that three resort casinos be approved misstated, in some editions, the relationship between the Genting Group, a Malaysian conglomerate, and Empire Resorts, which has proposed to build a resort near Monticello, N.Y. The family of Genting\u2019s chairman holds a controlling stake in Empire Resorts; Genting itself does not own Empire Resorts.Jesse McKinley reported from Albany, and Charles V. Bagli from New York.

{"Headline": "In Egypt, a Verdict Turns Back the Clock ", "Date": "2014-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialNow, in a final insult to the hundreds of protesters who were killed in the 2011 uprising, Mr. Mubarak apparently will go free, and there will be no justice for those who died or accountability for the decades of human rights abuses by his government. While legal experts said the dismissal of charges on Saturday against Mr. Mubarak was based on procedural reasons, his security chief and a half-dozen top police officials were acquitted. The court also acquitted Mr. Mubarak, his two sons and a wealthy business associate of corruption charges. In May, Mr. Mubarak was sentenced to three years in prison on a separate corruption case, but experts said his time since being detained in 2011 is likely to be counted as time served.The public prosecutor could appeal the murder case to the Court of Cassation, Egypt\u2019s highest criminal court. But, on Sunday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the former army general who overthrew the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013, seemed to rule that out. Meanwhile, Mr. Morsi and thousands of his Muslim Brotherhood supporters still languish in prison. Mr. Sisi said Egypt must \u201clook to the future\u201d and \u201ccannot ever go back.\u201d It appears that the Obama administration feels the same way. In a bizarre response, a State Department spokeswoman offered diplomatic pablum when asked to comment on the verdict and referred queries to the Egyptian government. In what sounds like an effort to tamp down public outrage, Mr. Sisi said there would be a review of government compensation to the families of those killed during the Arab Spring protests. He no doubt hopes Egyptians are so fed up with nearly four years of unrest that they would also be eager to put Mr. Mubarak\u2019s case behind them. He knows that the justice system, a misnomer by any sensible definition, is susceptible to pressure. That is how Mr. Mubarak got added belatedly to the murder case in the first place. The charges were initially brought against Mr. Mubarak\u2019s security chief and his senior assistants in March 2011; Mr. Mubarak was added as a co-defendant two months later after demonstrations demanded accountability for him as well. Half of Egypt\u2019s population is under the age of 25, and many of those young people were at the heart of the Arab Spring movement and its demands for jobs, education, housing and greater freedoms. Those aspirations won\u2019t go away. And while Egyptians may want stability, repression and a lack of accountability will produce only more discontent. The Mubarak verdict is another shift away from long delayed hopes for a productive and just society.Advertisement"}

All three predictions are depressingly realistic: The Russian economy appears headed for disaster just as certainly as Mr. Putin will most likely celebrate his next birthday in October 2015. And more likely than not, he will still be president of Russia then.Conventional wisdom \u2014 or conventional hope \u2014 among many of the people who would like to see the end of the Putin regime has long been that a turn for the worse in the Russian economy will make the moneyed elite turn on the Russian president. Journalists, pundits and Mr. Putin\u2019s political opponents in Russia have predicted that Western sanctions and the economic disaster they hasten will result in a coup d'\u00e9tat staged by oligarchs. There is just one problem with that argument: There are no oligarchs anymore.When Mr. Putin became acting president 15 years ago this month, Russia was an oligarchy \u2014 indeed the oligarchs, a small group of men who had grown very rich in the preceding decade, were instrumental in picking Putin out of obscurity and installing him at the helm. But within months, he made the oligarchs an offer they could not refuse: give up all of their political power and some of their wealth in exchange for safety, security and continued prosperity, or else be stripped of all power and assets.He meant it. The media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky, who rejected the new rules, was forced into exile in the summer of 2000, and uber-oligarch Boris Berezovsky followed him a few months later. When the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, refused any such bargain, he was jailed and his company was taken away. The process of destroying the Russian oligarchy was completed.In the 11 years since Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s arrest, Mr. Putin has consolidated power into what the political scientist Karen Dawisha calls \u201ckleptocratic authoritarianism.\u201d Its essential characteristic is all-encompassing corruption, which makes all the moneyed men of the Russian elite \u2014 and they are all men, and all moneyed \u2014 profoundly interdependent. Many of them have held public office during this time, but it has invariably been subject to three interlocking conditions: They had to pay to get into office, and though they could use the office for accumulating greater wealth, they could not use it to wield or gain political power.Giving up any pretense of independent political action has remained a condition for staying wealthy and safe. When the billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov tried, and rather modestly, to test this condition by reshaping an essentially pro-Kremlin but populist political party three years ago, he was yanked back harshly. Faced with the threat of losing his assets, he then fell back into line. In the new era of economic hardship, he has stayed in line: In his most recent demonstration of loyalty to the Kremlin, a media company Prokhorov owns has just kicked the tiny, embattled independent television company Dozhd (Rain) TV out of a temporary studio on its property.Over these years of helping Mr. Putin solidify his regime, the Russian rich have not only become entrenched in this corrupt system, but they have lost the very ability to form and pursue a political agenda. Those who predict an imminent coup \u2014 a coup by oligarchs as independent actors who can form a coalition to pursue their economic interests \u2014 are far off the mark. Imagine, rather, a large number of spiders all living in a single web. As the economy takes a dive, they are compelled simply to hold on for dear life. As the web begins to shrink, they can kick off it some of their weaker comrades \u2014 as has already happened with two major Russian entrepreneurs, Vladimir Yevtushenkov and Maxim Nogotkov, whose companies were taken away from them by men richer and more powerful than they. Meanwhile, Mr. Putin, who still sits in the middle of the intricate system he has woven over the course of 15 years, faces no such risk.Russia\u2019s economic troubles probably mean that the moneyed elite will suffer, with more of its members going into exile or even to jail while their assets are redistributed. As for the rest of the Russian population, more than 140 million people, bad economic news is just bad economic news: It spells out-of-control inflation and real daily hardship. But neither the self-cannibalizing rich nor the newly poor are likely to pose a challenge to Mr. Putin\u2019s power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Auctions, Russian Oligarchs Start to Hedge Their Bets", "Date": "2014-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The art market is sometimes said to be a \u201clagging indicator.\u201d If there\u2019s a downturn in the economy, the effects can take time to percolate through to the buying habits of wealthy collectors.On Sept. 15, 2008, the day Lehman Brothers, the United States\u2019 fourth-largest investment bank, filed for bankruptcy protection, Damien Hirst sold 70.5 million pounds, or about $127 million, of his works at Sotheby\u2019s in London. Some dealers at the sale hailed the result as proof that the market for contemporary art had finally become impervious to the economy\u2019s fluctuations. Over the next nine months, auction prices plummeted by as much as 50 percent. There was no such time lag last Monday evening when Sotheby\u2019s tried to sell 37 lots of high-value Russian art, a market dominated by affluent Russians. Earlier in the day, Russia\u2019s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, announced that the combination of Western sanctions triggered by his country\u2019s interventions in Ukraine and a 30 percent drop in the price of oil would cost his economy $140 billion. Meanwhile, the ruble has lost 30 percent of its value this year and inflation in Russia is predicted to reach 9 percent by the end of 2014, blighting the country\u2019s nascent middle class. At Sotheby\u2019s, only 12 of the lots, or 32 percent, found buyers.One of the failed sales was Konstantin Makovsky\u2019s garage door-size 1914 painting of the 17th-century Russian patriot Ivan Susanin being murdered. \u201cIt is your patriotic duty to buy this painting, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d the auctioneer Mark Poltimore had gamely and futilely pleaded. Its American-based private seller had been hoping for at least \u00a31.5 million. The session managed to raise \u00a35 million, with a top price of \u00a31.3 million given for a 1917 painting of the Crimean town of Bakhchisarai by the Russian painter and stage designer Boris Kustodiev. It sold to a single bid in the room. Sotheby\u2019s equivalent auction last year took \u00a37.8 million with a selling rate of 74 percent. \u201cIt was a reflection of what\u2019s going on in Russia,\u201d said the London-based specialist dealer James Butterwick. \u201cA lot of the usual Russian-based dealers weren\u2019t in London. Collectors are distracted.\u201d As we know, a certain stratum of Russian society became immensely rich through the sell-off of state assets that followed the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. According to the financial research database Wealth Insight, Moscow was home to 90 billionaires, the second most of any city, in 2013. Yet the Russian capital did not feature in Wealth Insight\u2019s list of the top 20 cities for millionaires. Yawning disparities in wealth all too often underpin extravagant spending on art. \u201cNational markets are an entry point for wealthy clients,\u201d said the London-based art adviser Wendy Goldsmith, a former auctioneer at Christie\u2019s Russian sales. \u201cThen the auction houses\u2019 dazzling marketing turns their heads and they see what else can be bought. But there is still money there for Russian masterpieces.\u201d On the morning of Sotheby\u2019s sale, Christie\u2019s was able to offer two outstanding paintings that were able to attract oligarch bidding. \u201cFor the top Russian pieces, people will pay crazy prices,\u201d said the underbidder, Alex Lachmann, a dealer based in Cologne, Germany. \u201cTrade for the middle market is rubbish now.\u201d Yuri Annenkov\u2019s 1922 mixed-media portrait of the writer Aleksandr Tikhonov is a landmark Russian avant-garde painting, reflected in the \u00a32.3 million paid for it at Christie\u2019s in 2007. When it reappeared at the same auction room on Monday it was bought by a Russian-speaking woman on a cellphone within the estimate for \u00a34 million. Nevertheless, the selling rate dropped from 71 percent at the equivalent sale last year to 57 percent, though the two paintings\u2019 high prices helped lift the total sale amount to \u00a320.2 million, an increase on last year\u2019s \u00a316.9 million. Sotheby\u2019s rival four-session offering took \u00a310.8 million. Bonhams also struggled to find buyers at its more mainstream 178-lot Russian sale on Wednesday. Just 38 percent of the material was sold, raising a modest \u00a31.7 million. A top price of \u00a3302,500 \u2014 well below the low estimate of \u00a3500,000 \u2014 was given for Aleksandr Yakovlev\u2019s 1918 tempera-on-canvas painting of an audience at a theater in China, \u201cLoge de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre \u00e0 Pekin.\u201dThe selling rate dipped to 34 percent on the same day at the specialist Russian art auctioneers MacDougall\u2019s, but among the 340 lots, a circa 1922 seascape by the Symbolist painter Nicholas Roerich, \u201cAnd We Continue Fishing,\u201d did sell for a low estimate of \u00a31.2 million. The total proceeds were \u00a37.8 million.London\u2019s \u201cRussia Week\u201d auctions have contracted to about half what they were in 2007, when the November series was worth \u00a396.6 million, according to statistics from the website russianartandculture.com. Russia\u2019s wealthy collectors are now concentrating more on big-ticket Old Masters, Impressionist and Modern and contemporary art. That said, they are still willing to splurge on an occasional trophy painting or a status-enhancing piece of Faberg\u00e9. A typically exquisite circa 1900 Faberg\u00e9 enamel and rock crystal study of a cornflower sold to a Russian private bidder for \u00a3314,500 at Christie\u2019s. The question is, if Russia\u2019s economy tips into recession, or extreme geopolitical crisis, will there be enough domestic demand left to sustain a category of \u201cnational\u201d sale that has been a feature of the London auction scene since the 1980s? Or will the focus of demand simply switch more to London itself, which, according to recent rough estimates, is home to a shifting population of 150,000 to 400,000 Russians? On Nov. 25, the London real estate broker Knight Frank said that 21 percent of the properties it had sold for more than \u00a310 million in the past six months had been bought by Russians. During the previous six months Russians had bought 13 percent. \u201cThe auction houses will probably have to drop the idea of evening sales and just take in fewer lots,\u201d said Mr. Butterwick, the London dealer. \u201cThere might be fewer buyers based in Russia, but there are plenty living here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Her family members, who will bury her Wednesday, have objected to the posting of the video, which the authorities say they are investigating.What is certain is that her fate has resonated because of heavy attention from conventional and social media, and also because Germany is immersed in discussion about how best to integrate non-Germans pouring in both as potential workers and as refugees fleeing war and hardship, from the Middle East to Africa. Although changing demographic patterns mean that foreign workers are critical to the continued success of Germany\u2019s economy, the immigrants are not always made to feel welcome.A growing group of immigrant women, frequently from Turkey, are entering professional life, often as teachers and social workers, but also as journalists and politicians.That gave Ms. Albayrak\u2019s death resonance beyond the misfortune of a good Samaritan who sacrificed her life trying to protect others. The youth suspected of attacking her is in detention; the two girls she reportedly tried to protect came forward and testified to the police only late on Monday.President Joachim Gauck, a former East German pastor who has made a point of opening up his presidential palace to multicultural gatherings, wrote to Ms. Albayrak\u2019s parents this week. \u201cLike countless citizens, I am horrified and shaken by this terrible deed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur whole country is grieving with you.\u201d\u201cWe grieve for an extraordinary woman, who showed civic courage and in doing so lost her life,\u201d the ad says, in German and Turkish.An article last Wednesday about the death of a Turkish-German student who was killed when she tried to stop a man from harassing two girls, a case that has provoked debate over Germany\u2019s efforts to form a multicultural society, referred incorrectly to the student, Tugce Albayrak. Although of Turkish descent, Ms. Albayrak was born in Germany; she was not an immigrant. The error was repeated in the headline.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Twist on French Tradition, Bosses Take to Streets in Protest", "Date": "2014-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 They jammed the boulevards, blowing whistles, tossing firecrackers, wearing locks and chains around their necks, and shouting into megaphones: \u201cEnough is enough!\u201dIn France, where protest marches are a well-practiced tradition, it is usually workers who take to the streets. But in a twist on Monday, thousands of French bosses demonstrated in Paris and Toulouse, the opening act in a weeklong revolt against government regulations and taxes that they say are straitjacketing companies, discouraging hiring and choking the economy.\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re being taken hostage,\u201d said Laurence Manabre, owner of a home-maintenance business that has 28 workers \u2014 but could employ many more, she said, if not for onerous government-imposed labor rules.Ms. Manabre marched with the throng toward the Finance Ministry, brandishing a bronze lock, a symbol that hundreds of other bosses wore to signify the constraints they said the Socialist government imposed on French businesses. \u201cBetween regulations, taxes, new laws, and razor-thin margins,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re being crushed little by little.\u201dBut for the heads of the thousands of small and midsize businesses \u2014 companies that represent the bulk of French economic activity \u2014 few of Mr. Hollande\u2019s efforts and promises so far have borne fruit. Now, concerned that changes coming to the French labor code, already approved by the government, will make it harder, rather than easier, to run their businesses, many who had never before engaged in protests have become demonstrators.High on their list of complaints is a measure to take effect next year that would require businesses to calculate whether workers with physically challenging jobs \u2014 in categories like construction and retailing \u2014 can retire early or obtain reductions in working hours. Companies say the change destabilizes their work forces and requires new software and investments to figure out how much working time counts as \u201cdifficult.\u201dBosses also oppose a new measure requiring new part-timers to work a minimum of 24 hours a week, saying it would diminish their flexibility to adjust to uncertain economic conditions.And then there are more entrenched parts of the French labor code, which employers say make it a difficult, lengthy process to lay off employees, and make bosses reluctant to take on new workers, especially with permanent contracts.\u201cFrance has high unemployment,\u201d Ms. Manabre said. \u201cBut the French labor code is incomprehensible, and it just keeps getting more complex. How can I possibly hire more people?\u201dOn the streets of Paris on Monday, some people had little sympathy for those arguments.\u201cI don\u2019t really understand this. These are the bosses, not the workers,\u201d said Jean-Marie Devin, an inspector at the French Railway Safety Authority, watching waves of people marching down the Boulevard de Bercy, chanting and wielding signs reading \u201cStop pillaging our business!\u201d and \u201cHollande, Resign!\u201d\u201cIf you have problems being a boss then change jobs!\u201d Mr. Devin said. \u201cEveryone has a knife to their throat. One only has to go look under any bridge in Paris and there are people who are starving.\u201dThe marchers, though, resented such remarks.\u201cWe should not be confused with the big bosses of blue-chip companies, who make millions and get golden parachutes,\u201d said Jean-Jacques Roland, 68, who runs Cetif, a company repairing and selling parts for trucks, touring buses and industrial vehicles in Senlis, France.Mr. Roland has 35 employees, and his son is supposed to take over the business when he retires. But now his son is thinking of leaving the country, Mr. Roland said, because \u201cFrance doesn\u2019t seem to have a future, and the conditions for entrepreneurs are difficult.\u201dMr. Roland said he did not plan to hire more workers, out of concern that coming regulations would menace his already-thin profit margins. \u201cThe only thing that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has succeeded in doing,\u201d he said, \u201cis to get not only workers to protest in the streets, but bosses, too.\u201dFrance\u2019s main employers organizations are all planning more activities this week to get their message across to the government \u2014 even if the groups could not agree on how to go about it.The C.G.P.M.E., France\u2019s main association for small and midsize businesses, called on all bosses to take to the streets. \u201cWe want the government to simplify rules,\u201d said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roubaud, president of the group. \u201cBut they keep adding measures that complicate everything.\u201dIn contrast, officials at Medef, the organization that includes France\u2019s biggest companies, worried about the perceptions of street demonstrations and instead planned to hold a series of meetings and discussions that they hope government officials will attend.Pierre Gattaz, president of Medef, said he would press the government for further tax cuts. Mr. Hollande recently announced future tax breaks for business worth about 40 billion euros, or roughly $50 billion, in exchange for hiring quotas. But Mr. Gattaz said in an interview that those were already being offset by new social charges \u2014 contributions to pensions and the French welfare system that employers pay per worker.\u201cNapoleon Bonaparte,\u201d Mr. Gattaz added, \u201csaid that the art of war is simple \u2014 it\u2019s all in the execution. The government needs to follow Bonaparte\u2019s example.\u201dCamille Wild, who with a business partner runs Le Prieur\u00e9 des Sources, a spa chain in central France, said taxes and social charges were so high that she has had almost no return on her investment since opening shop in 2005. All of her earnings have gone toward paying her 12 employees, Ms. Wild said, and she has abstained from paying herself a salary for the first five years.\u201cI took care of my employees, but I have nothing left over \u2014 no pension, no guarantee, no social security coverage,\u201d Ms. Wild said. \u201cPeople do not recognize that a business chief has value.\u201d\u201cThese days, I just feel like giving up,\u201d Ms. Wild said. \u201cBut I have employees, and I can\u2019t give up for them.\u201dLaure Fourquet contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Technology Could Help Fight Income Inequality", "Date": "2014-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewRising income inequality has set off fierce political and economic debates, but one important angle hasn\u2019t been explored adequately. We need to ask whether market forces themselves might limit or reverse the trend. Technology has contributed to the rise in inequality, but there are also some significant ways in which technology could reduce it.For example, while computers have improved our lives in many ways, they haven\u2019t yet done much to make health care and education cheaper. Over the next few decades, however, that may well change: We can easily imagine medical diagnosis by online artificial intelligence, greater use of online competitive procurement for health care services, more transparency in pricing and thus more competition, and much cheaper online education for many students, to cite just a few possibilities. In such a world, many wage gains would come from new and cheaper services, rather than from being able to cut a better deal with the boss at work.It is a bit harder to see how information technology can lower housing costs, but perhaps the sharing economy can make it easier to live in much smaller spaces and rent needed items, rather than store them in a house or apartment. That would enable lower-income people to live closer to higher-paying urban jobs and at lower cost.Another set of future gains, especially for lesser-skilled workers, may come as computers become easier to handle for people with rudimentary skill. Not everyone can work fruitfully with computers now. There is a generation gap when it comes to manipulating electronic devices, and many relevant tasks require knowledge of programming or, more ambitiously, the entrepreneurial skill of creating a start-up. That, in a nutshell, is how our dynamic sector has concentrated its gains among a relatively small number of employees, thus leading to more income inequality.This particular type of inequality may very well change. As the previous generation retires from the work force, many more people will have grown up with intimate knowledge of computers. And over time, it may become easier to work with computers just by talking to them. As computer-human interfaces become simpler and easier to manage, that may raise the relative return to less-skilled labor. The future may also extend a growing category of employment, namely workers who team up with smart robots that require human assistance. Perhaps a smart robot will perform some of the current functions of a factory worker, while the human companion will do what the robot cannot, such as deal with a system breakdown or call a supervisor. Such jobs would require versatility and flexible reasoning, a bit like some of the old manufacturing jobs, but not necessarily a lot of high-powered technical training, again because of the greater ease of the human-computer interface. That too could raise the returns to many relatively unskilled workers.A final set of forces to reverse growing inequality stem from the emerging economies, most of all China. Perhaps we are living in a temporary intermediate period when America and many other developed nations bear a lot of the costs of Chinese economic development without yet getting many of the potential benefits. For instance, China and other emerging nations are already rich enough to bid up commodity prices and large enough to drive down the wages of a lot of American middle-class workers, especially in manufacturing. Yet while these emerging economies are keeping down the costs of manufactured goods for American consumers, they are not yet innovative enough to send us many fantastic new products, the way that the United States sends a stream of new products to British or French consumers, to their benefit. That state of affairs will probably end. Over the next few decades, we can expect China, India and other emerging nations to supply more innovations to the global economy, including to the United States. This shouldn\u2019t be a cause for alarm. It will lead to many good things. Since the emerging economies are relatively poor, many of these innovations may benefit relatively low-income Americans. India has already pioneered techniques for cheap, high-quality heart surgery and other medical procedures, and over time such techniques may achieve a foothold in the United States. Imagine a future China producing cheaper and safer cars, a cure for some kinds of cancer, and workable battery storage for solar energy. Ordinary Americans could be much better off, and without having to work for those gains.To be clear, these are speculations and should not be taken as reasons to avoid improving our economy right now; furthermore, other trends may push in less positive directions. Still, these possibilities reframe the inequality problem. In the popular model developed by the economist Thomas Piketty, inequality is fundamentally about capital versus labor. In his view, capital has opened up an ever-widening lead because of the relatively high rates of return on savings and investment. The natural response to reverse this trend, according to Mr. Piketty, would be a direct attack on the return to capital, such as through a global wealth tax. In the scenarios outlined here, though, growing inequality is highly contingent on particular technologies and the global conditions of the moment. Movements toward greater inequality often set countervailing forces in motion, even if those forces take a long time to come to fruition. From this perspective, rather than seeking to beat down capital, our attention should be directed to leaving open the future possibilities for innovation, change and dynamism. Even if income inequality continues to increase in the short run, as I believe is likely, there exists a plausible and more distant future in which we are mostly much better off and more equal. The history of technology suggests that new opportunities for better living and higher wages are being created, just not as quickly as we might like.TYLER COWEN is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

{"Headline": "Save a Few Pennies on Champagne? Lawmakers in Britain\u2019s House of Lords Are Aghast", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 These are tough times in Britain. Half a million British children are going hungry, the government plans to cut public spending to a share of the economy not seen since the 1930s, and the honorable lords and ladies of the House of Lords have come under attack for their Champagne budget.But hardship breeds revolt, even, it appears, by the peers of the realm. The Champagne wars, as some here call them, broke out in recent weeks after news that the lords and ladies had rejected a proposal a few years ago to save the taxpayers some money by merging the catering department of their chamber, the unelected upper house of Parliament, with that of the House of Commons, the elected lower chamber. Apparently, \u201cthe lords feared that the quality of Champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service.\u201dThose words, from Malcolm Jack, a former clerk of the Commons who was interviewed by a committee of lawmakers this month, caused some astonishment.\u201cIs that true? Did you make that up?\u201d asked the chairman of the committee, Jack Straw, a former home secretary.\u201cYes, it is true,\u201d Mr. Jack replied.The House of Lords, which gets an annual catering subsidy of 1.3 million pounds, or $2 million, has spent $415,563 on about 17,000 bottles of Champagne since the Conservative-led government of Prime Minister David Cameron took office in 2010 and started cutting public spending. That is roughly five bottles for each of its 791 peers each year.Owen Williams, a spokesman for the House of Lords, disputed the idea that the proposal to merge the catering services had ever been discussed, calling Mr. Jack\u2019s testimony \u201cinaccurate.\u201d In an interview, Mr. Williams also pointed out that the bubbly was not given to peers for free, but sold at a profit in their private bars and at banquets.But at a time of widespread hunger and plans for deep budget cuts, that explanation did little to help the image of the lords and ladies. The British news media condemned \u201cpampered peers\u201d and \u201cChampagne Charlies,\u201d questioning the rationale not only for a Champagne budget but also for keeping a mostly appointed and still partly hereditary house \u2014 a legislative chamber that is now the world\u2019s biggest, outside China, because no one is ever forced to retire.News of the Champagne budget has also sharpened the focus on the widening gap between the privileged few and those less fortunate.While members of the House of Lords can claim \u00a3300 a day simply for showing up, the number of people receiving emergency food aid from the Trussel Trust \u2014 the country\u2019s largest food bank charity \u2014 on at least three days last year rose above 913,000, a nearly threefold increase from the previous year.The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who announced the report\u2019s release last week, described his shock at seeing people lining up outside food banks. Frank Field, a lawmaker from the Labour Party who helped to lead the inquiry that the report was based on, said half a million children lived in families that were unable to feed them, and in half of all British families, an adult skipped a meal each day. \u201cSomething disturbing is happening,\u201d he told reporters. Families, devastated by wage stagnation and delays in benefit payments, are often only \u201cone bill away\u201d from crisis.The report panel, which interviewed 155 witnesses and received 246 written submissions, said that its very existence would have been unthinkable 30 years ago, when the assumption was that \u201cnobody in Britain could be hungry unless they wished to be.\u201dAs economists and labor unions wondered whether the planned austerity measures would take Britain back to the precariousness of Victorian times or merely to something like the aftermath of the Great Depression, the Office for Budget Responsibility, a nonpartisan economic think tank, calculated that if Mr. Osborne followed through, government consumption of goods and services would fall to its lowest share of gross domestic product since 1938.One member of the House of Lords, Patrick Jenkin, decided to set an example this week by retiring at age 88. He is urging his fellow octogenarians to do the same. \u201cI see some of these extinct volcanoes sitting on the back bench of the Labour Party and they are just waiting for some money,\u201d he told The Daily Telegraph. \u201cIt is a great shame. It can\u2019t go on.\u201dMeanwhile, Anne Jenkin, a Conservative member of the House of Lords who is the daughter-in-law of Mr. Jenkin, offered her own explanation for the country\u2019s increasing hunger: \u201cPoor people do not know how to cook.\u201dHer bowl of porridge in the morning, Ms. Jenkin said, costs 4 pence, far less than the \u201csugary cereal\u201d poor people eat.It turns out that Ms. Jenkin is a member of the Lords\u2019 Refreshment Committee, which is in charge of Champagne procurement. She later apologized for any offense her comments might have caused, but the damage was done. Ms. Jenkin\u2019s words quickly made headlines.\u201cLet them eat porridge!\u201d the newspapers said.Advertisement"}

Brian Gross of Epiphany Catholic Church, their pastor.\u201cYou\u2019re part of something big,\u201d Mr. Ray, 45, recently recalled the priest having told the couple. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re part of something big, you\u2019re going to come under spiritual attack. But fear isn\u2019t from God. God doesn\u2019t push. God doesn\u2019t rush. God is just there waiting for you.\u201dWhen he came to Watford City, a newcomer from the comparative metropolis of Bismarck, Father Gross was replacing a predecessor who had been at Epiphany for 24 years. For much of that time, Watford City had been dribbling away, its population falling by one-third from 1980 to 2000, down to about 1,400. The congregation of Epiphany numbered perhaps 90.Then, within the past decade, the energy industry brought the process of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to the Bakken oil field of North Dakota, setting off a boom that stood in neon counterpoint to the national recession. Both the physical and human landscapes of the region have been metamorphosing virtually by the moment.\u201cWhen I was in seminary, this wasn\u2019t on the radar screen,\u201d Father Gross, 36, put it. \u201cWhen I was ordained, this wasn\u2019t on the radar screen. I thought maybe I\u2019d be a high school teacher. Or I\u2019d be in a typical North Dakota parish with traditional North Dakota families. You go hunting, you meet people at the coffee shop. It\u2019d be the familiar small-town stuff. But everything\u2019s changing at warp speed.\u201dEighteen-wheelers roar down divided highways that didn\u2019t exist a few years ago. Patches of hurry-up housing \u2014 apartments, suburb-like subdivisions, mobile homes tethered to propane tanks, barracks known as man camps \u2014 spread over the former fields of soy or cattle. Where the highest building in town used to be the grain elevator, New York investors have put up the Watford City version of a skyscraper, four stories tall. The volunteer fire company had to buy a ladder truck to be able to reach it.For generations the remote terrain of Scandinavian and German stock, Watford City now attracts roughnecks and roustabouts, geologists and engineers. There are oil patch pros from East Texas, hopeful and desperate immigrants from Mexico, African-Americans escaping the cratered economy of places like East St. Louis. And with a male-to-female ratio estimated as high as 20 to 1, the vices have followed in step: pornography, prostitution, alcoholism, crystal meth.The sole priest in the only Catholic church for a 20 miles around, Father Gross provides the staples of parish life: Mass seven times a week, confession whenever requested, religious education classes, baptism, first communion. He has begun a discussion group for men, made himself a regular at the town\u2019s nine-hole golf course, and tossed down the occasional shot of tequila with Mexican parents celebrating a child\u2019s baptism.\u201cYou want to sit down and talk about sports? I can do that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to tell me what you do on your rig? I\u2019m authentically interested. I want to know who you are. And I want to help people realize that a relationship with Christ isn\u2019t some ethereal, pie-in-the-sky, nuns-with-crossed-hands cute thing. When it\u2019s 10 degrees out and the wind is howling, Jesus is a man who gets what you do. He even understands you use the F-word a lot.\u201dIn part, Father Gross\u2019s supple way with theology reflects his personal experience. Though born Catholic, he attended public school and a state university, working toward a degree in information technology. When his college roommate went to Mass, Father Gross stayed in their apartment to watch \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201dSo he felt righteously ambushed when he went to confession in 2001 for the first time in 15 years. He gave up partying for Lent and printed out an annotated list of the Ten Commandments to tally up all his sins. A trial weekend in seminary convinced him that he had found the path.In Watford City in August 2013, that path intersected with the route of a young man named Anthony Loyola. Burdened by $27,000 in college loans, Mr. Loyola had migrated from Milwaukee with a line on a welding job. The work, though, proved sporadic, and the oil field mores tested his morals. A co-worker, just trying to be welcoming, once offered to buy Mr. Loyola a night with a hooker.By the onset of last winter, the one so frigid it put \u201cpolar vortex\u201d in the vocabulary, Mr. Loyola was between jobs and struggling to hang on. Father Gross let him park his van in the church\u2019s lot \u2014 otherwise, it cost $500 a month to rent a permanent space \u2014 and use the building to wash up and cook meals. From the pews, Mr. Loyola would pray to Joseph, the patron saint of workers, \u201cthat it would all work out.\u201dOn May 1, on the Feast of Joseph the Worker, Mr. Loyola got a job in a natural-gas plant. He was able to move out of the parking lot and rent room in a camper with two Mexican brothers and their mother. Whenever she cooks for them, she saves a plate for Mr. Loyola.Mr. Loyola, 30, remains a regular at Epiphany, part of a congregation that has reached 300. His fellow worshipers include Shawn and Stephanie Ray, whose daughters are both in religious education classes there. When they finish building their home, perhaps by this summer, they will ask Father Gross to bless it.With Watford City\u2019s population now above 3,000, and future estimates ranging to 10 times as much, Father Gross has his eye on a 20-acre lot a mile or so from Epiphany for an expanded church and a parochial school. When? he is asked. And his answer comes: \u201cOn God\u2019s time.\u201dEmail: sgf1@columbia.edu\nTwitter: @SamuelGFreedmanAdvertisement"}

The streets outside were deserted, faint yellow light spilling out from the sheet metal shanties. No male clientele was in sight.\u201cIt\u2019s been slow and rough,\u201d said Tina, who, like the others, declined to disclose her full name because of her line of work.\u201cYeah,\u201d said Susan. \u201cIt\u2019s dead.\u201dZenab stood up for a second to adjust her dress, which fit like a wet suit.Freetown does not have a single working traffic signal, and now legions of the unemployed and youths out of school thicken the streets while foreign tourists stay far away.Ebola\u2019s nasty reputation as a contagious disease that can slither across borders and make people bleed from their eyeballs has become so oversized and onerous that it has managed to dent tourism across the entire continent.Mr. Beekwilder said safari inquiries on his site were down 25 percent since the outbreak began this year. And that includes trips to Nairobi and Cape Town, which are actually farther from the Ebola zone than London.More than any loss of life or manpower, it is the extreme efforts to check the disease that are proving far more costly to the economies. Shutting schools, quarantining whole districts, sealing borders, canceling flights and banning public gatherings may have helped reduce transmission of the disease, but such measures have crippled trade. The shame of it is that Sierra Leone was growing at an impressive clip \u2014 before Ebola hit.\u201cIt could be potentially devastating if it continues like this,\u201d said Peter Smerdon, a spokesman for the World Food Program.A review of the two dozen recorded Ebola outbreaks suggests some common themes.\u201cThis place is lawless,\u201d said Mahmoud Kadi, a furniture maker, who like many others reported that crime was soaring because of the inordinate number of teenagers loitering on the streets, with the police distracted by Ebola.\u201cMore people are building walls and hiring guards to protect their property,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days, you just never know.\u201d\u201cFor some of my movies, I need reality,\u201d Sara explained.\u201cEverything\u2019s done,\u201d he said.At first glance, life seems unchanged in Freetown, with most shops open and the streets flowing with a steady current of commerce. From the tops of their heads, hordes of young people march by selling everything imaginable: melons, popcorn, fly swatters, Cokes, pipes, socks, T-shirts, cement mix.But a closer look reveals the scars. On the outskirts of town stands a deserted bridge project, halted after the Chinese workers who were building it fled because of Ebola. All around are half-finished hotels and houses, rusty rebar poking out. On Lumley Beach Road, which used to be jumping, some of the bars appear like something out of Robinson Crusoe \u2014 they are abandoned, with torn-up canvas roofs and bugs scuttling across the empty, salt-stained floors.Tina, Susan and Zenab, the three prostitutes, said they used to get plenty of business from the bar scene on the beach.\u201cBut it\u2019s hard to have sex if you don\u2019t touch,\u201d Tina said. \u201cAnd even if I got a customer now, I better be careful.\u201dHer friends just stared at their drinks. Faint reggae rap played in the distance. The soft crush of waves could be heard just beyond that.Tina looked pained.\u201cI have a son to feed,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think even when it\u2019s over, it\u2019ll go back to normal?\u201dAdvertisement"}

You may call it whatever you want.\u201dIn his more confrontational moments, the 62-year-old president found a new way to expound on his favorite theme this year: that he was determined to thwart plots by the West in general and the United States in particular against Russia. Using the symbol of the Russian bear, Mr. Putin said he wondered how the creature should behave.\u201cMaybe he should stop chasing pigs and boars around the taiga, but start picking berries and eating honey. Maybe then he will be left alone,\u201d Mr. Putin said, warming to the analogy. \u201cBut no, he won\u2019t be! Because someone will always try to chain him up. As soon as he\u2019s chained, they will tear out his teeth and claws.\u201dThe latter, he said, was a reference to Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrence.His remarks on the economy held the most interest, given that the price of oil and the Russian ruble plummeted in tandem this week, with the ruble testing historic lows of 80 to the dollar before rallying to closer to 60, though still down about 40 percent on the year.Analysts said the decline reflected not just the drop in oil prices but also investors\u2019 distrust of the government\u2019s ability to cope, or to promote economic growth through something other than oil exports. \u201cEconomically, socially and politically, the country will have to go through severe economic tests in the years to come,\u201d said Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cNot having a working, realistic, credible model for economic development, not just muddling through, will become critical.\u201dMr. Putin acknowledged that many Russians blamed Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of the central bank, for the crisis, but he defended the record of the bank.\u201cI believe that the central bank and the government are taking adequate measures,\u201d he said. He did not present any new policies or a specific plan to address the problems, but rejected predictions that currency controls were in the offing.He also said Russia should try not to waste its $419 billion in currency reserves. The central bank has spent about $75 billion this year defending the ruble.The president, sitting on a small stage in an amphitheater in a Moscow hotel, seemed to be relying on his high popularity to carry the day, noting that Russia had emerged from the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed under his leadership. But it remained an open question whether that would be enough to persuade Russians, who are facing a sharp recession next year.\u201cAbove all, the goal was to calm people down about the crisis,\u201d Mikhail Vinogradov, head of the St. Petersburg Politics Foundation, said by telephone shortly after the speech. \u201cThe question is whether Putin\u2019s calming words will turn into any kind of action.\u201dOrdinary Russians are worried about the ruble\u2019s collapse and rising inflation, which is expected to climb 10 percent by the end of the year and even higher early next year. They have flooded car dealerships, appliance stores and malls to spend savings before their rubles lose any more value.The popular discount Swedish furniture chain Ikea has been mobbed for the last week. On Thursday, the company announced that it was suspending all sales of kitchen furniture and appliances for two days to catch up with the orders. It also announced that it would raise prices \u2014 a common step by importers trying to keep up with the lower value of the ruble. Russia depends on imports for about 30 percent of its consumer goods.Mr. Putin accused the West of trying to build a virtual wall around Russia by moving NATO forces closer to its border, and noted that the $50 billion that Russia plans to spend on its military next year is much less than the Pentagon\u2019s budget.He also conceded that Russia had contributed to a recent rise in global tensions by resuming long-range military surveillance flights across Europe and along the edges of North America. \u201cThe only thing we have done is to protect our interests in a tougher way,\u201d he said.That theme plays well at home, where political analysts estimate as much as 40 percent of the population wants Russia to regain its superpower status.Mr. Putin slipped in some criticism of the C.I.A. torture report in response to a question about the legality of burning the homes of suspected terrorists in Chechnya. \u201cAfter 9/11, torture was legalized. How could you explain that?\u201d he asked, a reference to the waterboarding of terror suspects by the C.I.A. during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Mr. Putin estimated that 25 to 30 percent of the economic distress was rooted in the sanctions over Ukraine, but conceded that Russia had not done enough to diversify an economy in which energy resources constitute 60 percent of the country\u2019s exports.Even while Mr. Putin was speaking, the European Union imposed an array of new sanctions involving investment, services and trade linked to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.Russian corporations owe approximately $650 billion to Western banks, but sanctions have eliminated any chance of refinancing that debt. The foreign reserves should cover that for the time being, Mr. Putin suggested, though some analysts say as much as half of that \u2014 around $200 billion \u2014 is tied up in other obligations, like pensions.Mr. Putin stressed that Russia wanted to solve the crisis in Ukraine, and said he thought that President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine did, too, but that some nationalists there did not.In response to a question from a Ukrainian reporter about how many Russian soldiers had been dispatched into eastern Ukraine and how many had died there, Mr. Putin again called Russian fighters volunteers. He did not say how many had died. Still, Russia has toned down its rhetoric on Ukraine in the last month.The news conference is an annual ritual, with Mr. Putin picking questions at random from 1,200 or so reporters ranging from the mainstream Russian press to the BBC.In one awkward moment, a Russian reporter suggested in slurred speech that Mr. Putin support the sale of kvass, a mildly alcoholic beverage, in international chain stores. Mr. Putin suggested that the man might have been sipping a little. The Russian media soon reported that the reporter was not drunk, but that his speech had been slurred by two strokes.Several journalists asked why the state media had been unleashed to attack government critics as fifth columnists, to which Mr. Putin said it was sometimes hard to tell where \u201cthe opposition ends and the fifth column starts.\u201d A fifth column is a group that tries to undermine a larger group. One reporter asked about Mr. Putin\u2019s personal life. The president answered by saying that recently a European dignitary had asked him whether he had any love in his life.Mr. Putin said he had assured the unidentified visitor that he did, that he saw his former wife periodically as well as his two grown daughters. \u201cEverything is fine,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the value of Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. They are about $400 billion, not $400 million.Andrew Roth contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Minorities Fall Further Behind Whites in Wealth During Economic Recovery", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2007, when the recession began in the United States, the median net worth of white households was $192,500, or 10 times that of black households at $19,200.For Hispanics the numbers are similar, albeit slightly higher, than those for blacks. In 2007, the median net worth of a Hispanic household was $23,600, and in 2013 it was $13,700.\u201cThe gaps are big, and they are also persistent,\u201d said Rakesh Kochhar, the associate director for research at Pew\u2019s Hispanic Trends Project and one of the report\u2019s authors. In the last 30 years, net worth for white American households has hovered around $100,000, or six to eight times as high as net worth for blacks, Mr. Kochhar said.The survey has been conducted every three years since 1983, with the largest wealth gap between blacks and whites recorded in 1989. That year, the median net worth of white households was 17 times as large as that of black households and 14 times that of Hispanic households.Wealth is defined as the value of an accumulated sum of assets that could include income, financial products like stocks and bonds, retirement accounts or real estate minus the debt that is owed against those assets. It is built up over time and tends to increase with age, Mr. Kochhar said. This in part explains the widening racial gap, because blacks tend to earn less than whites and have less assets than whites do to pass on to future generations.According to the Federal Reserve data, the median income of minority households fell 9 percent from 2010 to 2013, compared with 1 percent for whites. Homeownership, also a factor in the creation of wealth, fell 6.5 percent for minority households from 2010 to 2013, compared with 2 percent for whites.A \u201clegacy of discrimination,\u201d including lower levels of education and depressed property values in certain minority communities, has played a role in the widening wealth gap, Mr. Kochhar said.A slight increase in net worth of Hispanics over blacks can partly be explained by geography, he said. Hispanics are more concentrated in states with higher home values like California, New York and Florida; blacks may own homes in Southern states with lower home values.While all American households have lower assets, the decrease has been more significant among minority households, the report said.The Hispanic population is also likelier to be younger and likelier to be immigrants, who often take 20 to 30 years to settle into a new country before beginning to accumulate wealth, Mr. Kochhar said.An earlier version of this article misstated the ratio for the difference between the net worth of white household income in the last 30 years compared to blacks. It was 6 to 8 times, not percent.An article on Saturday about the widening financial gap between white and minority households reversed the calculation for determining net worth, a factor used to illustrate the disparity. It is assets minus debts, not assets subtracted from debts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Altman\u2019s Noir Suddenly Gets Plenty of Light ", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookSpend your time on New York\u2019s repertory-film circuit and you get used to seeing certain titles. You never have to wait too long for another screening of \u201cVertigo\u201d or \u201cCitizen Kane.\u201d Sometimes the same old movie will pop up in two different theaters within a few months. This \u201cLong Goodbye\u201d takeover is coincidence, of course. Bruce Goldstein, Film Forum\u2019s longtime director of repertory programming, called it serendipity: The film \u201cjust happens to be essential to three different series playing around town,\u201d he said. But I won\u2019t let that kill my buzz. Serendipity is a perfectly good excuse to draw attention to one of your favorite movies.And the three series in which it\u2019s playing offer a clue to the attraction of a film that doesn\u2019t get the attention of Altman\u2019s heavyweights, like \u201cNashville,\u201d \u201cMcCabe & Mrs. Miller\u201d and \u201cShort Cuts,\u201d but that seems to come up every time I talk to someone about their favorite Altmans. \u201cThe Long Goodbye\u201d sits at all these intersections: of Altman and Chandler, of Altman and noir, of the 1950s (when the novel was written) and the 1970s, of old and (at the time) new Los Angeles. The film has many points of entry, including Elliott Gould\u2019s eccentric, loopy, intensely likable performance as Chandler\u2019s private eye, Philip Marlowe. The series accompanies Mr. Kahane\u2019s performances there of his new album, \u201cThe Ambassador,\u201d a song cycle that explores the history and fantasy of Los Angeles, and he said that for him the real appeal of \u201cThe Long Goodbye\u201d was the way it transformed the noir narrative for a more cynical, more ruthlessly capitalistic era.\u201cAt the center of it is the way noir means something fundamentally different in the 1970s because of our collective consciousness about how the economy has shifted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe film is at once neo-noir and an elegy for the golden age of noir.\u201dWorking from a screenplay by Leigh Brackett that ruthlessly distilled Chandler\u2019s novel, Altman rendered the streamlined story \u2014 Marlowe gives a friend a ride to Tijuana, the friend is accused of killing his wife and then turns up dead himself, Marlowe sets out to prove the friend\u2019s innocence \u2014 as a series of mostly comic set pieces. He simultaneously satirized the post-hippie self-absorption of Southern California, registered the narrow-minded brutality of the cops and gangsters, and signaled his fondness for an old Hollywood that was already history in 1973.Mr. Gould\u2019s Marlowe, always dressed in black suit and tie despite the blinding light and driving a hulking 1940s Lincoln, is the last honest man in this sun-kissed cesspool. He\u2019s an avatar of the midcentury noir hero, out of step but also thoroughly up-to-date, a hipster in the original sense. He rolls with whatever the city and the times throw at him \u2014 the blissed-out women next door doing yoga in the nude; the vicious mobster who strips in a fake-sensitive display of honesty \u2014 shrugging and repeating the mantra: \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. with me.\u201d Until, in the end, he discovers that some things just aren\u2019t O.K.The director, while moving the mystery plot forward with speed and elliptical precision, added layers of wit around Mr. Gould\u2019s performance. Altman favorites like David Carradine, as a talkative cellmate of Marlowe\u2019s; Henry Gibson, as the frighteningly avaricious proprietor of a rehab clinic; and Jack Riley (of the original \u201cBob Newhart Show\u201d) as a lounge pianist, provide piquant cameos. In the film\u2019s best-known twist, the torchy, throwback theme song is heard repeatedly in different versions, emerging from car radios, as supermarket Muzak, in a doorbell\u2019s chime or played as a funeral march by a Mexican street band.Altman spent much of his career tearing apart and reconstituting Hollywood genres in his own sly, satirical fashion \u2014 the war film in \u201cMASH,\u201d the teen comedy in \u201cO.C. and Stiggs.\u201d In some cases, as with the western \u201cMcCabe & Mrs. Miller\u201d or the musical protest film \u201cNashville,\u201d the results had profound, mythic dimensions. In \u201cThe Long Goodbye\u201d the result is elegiac and entertaining, bittersweet and ceaselessly funny.\u201cAltman always takes the genre seriously,\u201d said Ron Magliozzi, associate curator of film at MoMA and the curator of the museum\u2019s Altman retrospective. \u201c\u00a0\u2018The Long Goodbye\u2019 is subverting noir, it is making it comic, but it\u2019s a serious take on the genre. That\u2019s what gives it real body \u2014 it\u2019s what makes you feel there\u2019s something serious going on there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuba\u2019s Zeal for Tight Control Casts a Pall on New Markets", "Date": "2014-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by12 PhotosOfficial documents promised big incentives for investors: Foreign companies would be given greater control over setting wages at factories inside the zone; proposals would be approved or rejected within 60 days.A year later, the Cuban government has yet to announce a single foreign investment. Officials insist that interest is high, but over the past few years, more foreign investors have left Cuba than have arrived. Analysts and some foreign businesspeople say they have been turned off by a government determined to open its economy and political system no more than a crack to keep free markets and broader freedoms in check.Mr. Castro\u2019s agreement last week with the United States to release political prisoners and normalize relations appears to many experts to be an economic decision at its core. It is driven both by the need for a new source of growth and by a desire to put off, at least for now, more fundamental questions about how deeply the government intends to push changes.The country clearly needs a stimulus: Economic growth is expected to be just 1.3 percent this year, below the government\u2019s target of 2.2 percent, despite more than five years of new policies that allow Cubans to open small businesses, work abroad, and buy and sell property and cars.Yet according to many economists, President Obama\u2019s plan to allow more interaction between the two countries may not be the lifeline Cuba is hoping for \u2014 unless Cuba overcomes its resistance to change as well.To reap the benefits of what Mr. Obama is offering, from telecommunications sales to credit cards, he added, Cuba needs to transition from a country where \u201cthe safest bet is to do nothing\u201d to one where new ideas are embraced even if they threaten Communist control.At least initially, Cuba may be able to put off the challenge. American companies that provide educational tours to Cuba under current regulations report that interest has skyrocketed since last week\u2019s announcement. At insightCuba, a travel provider in New Rochelle, N.Y., calls and online interest have tripled.About 400,000 Americans, most of them Cuban-Americans, currently travel to Cuba every year. If that number doubles, and if each visitor spends a typical sum of around $1,000, Cuba will earn an additional $400 million from the United States.Americans bringing back $400 worth of Cuban products (no more than $100 in tobacco and rum), as Mr. Obama\u2019s new rules allow, could push that figure higher.But travelers, and the Cuban government, will still face other limits, like capacity. The island\u2019s hotels, especially in Havana, are already full for most of the high season, so more Americans may simply mean fewer Canadians, Europeans and others who have no limit on spending.Cuba also failed to meet its goal of three million visitors in 2013, according to official figures, in part for some of the same reasons that there are no new companies in Mariel\u2019s special development zone, which as of this week was still being leveled by bulldozers. Many new hotel developments have been only inching their way through the Cuban bureaucracy.Foreign investment over all has contracted under the weight of Cuban officialdom and \u201ca general fear of capriciousness of policy toward foreign businesses,\u201d said Archibald Ritter, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa who studies the Cuban economy.In tourism, for example, Cuba is calling for investment in a number of new areas, while stating that in Havana and Varadero, two especially desirable locations, investor participation \u201cwill be the exception\u201d as state firms are favored.In the energy sector, too, there are limits to protect the status quo: The portfolio of potential investment is heavily focused on projects that would increase the amount of electricity produced by renewable sources, but these ventures would have to sell their output to the government at prices fixed ahead of time.Even in the industries that have seen the most change since Mr. Castro became president in 2006, like agriculture, results have been tethered by the state. Farmers have complained that laws adopted in 2008 and 2012 to encourage Cubans to develop idle land did not go far enough toward ownership. Lease contracts must be reapproved every 10 years, limiting interest.Michael Mora, 32, a farmer harvesting blood-red beets from the dark soil just outside Havana on Monday, identified another common problem: transportation to bring products to market. \u201cA lot of times, we use bicycles,\u201d he said.The United States is prepared to help. Mr. Obama\u2019s new policy falls short of lifting the trade embargo. But his plan includes provisions allowing Americans to export agricultural equipment for small Cuban farmers, building materials for private residential construction, \u201cgoods for use by private-sector Cuba entrepreneurs,\u201d and telecommunications equipment, including cellphones, and the infrastructure needed to expand Internet access.If the United States removes Cuba from the list of states that sponsor terrorism, a prospect raised by Mr. Obama, Cuba could also apply for financing from the International Monetary Fund or other global creditors to help pay for things like tractors or trucks.But with both the United States and the I.M.F., the details would have to be negotiated, and it is not clear whether Cuba would accept the American focus on independent businesses or the demands of global financiers.

{"Headline": "Moldova Vote Gives Edge to Parties Looking West", "Date": "2014-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShadowed by the continuing violence in neighboring Ukraine, the election in Moldova, one of Europe\u2019s smallest and poorest nations, became another fierce contest between the West and Russia for influence in a former Soviet republic.Russia already plays a significant role in Moldova because of the pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria, which declared independence in 1990 and was the subject of a military conflict in 1992. Russian troops have long been stationed in Transnistria as peacekeeping forces.Senior Russian officials, including a deputy prime minister, Dmitri O. Rogozin, said the election results were rigged by Moldova\u2019s current, pro-European government. On Wednesday, just four days before the vote, the country\u2019s Central Election Commission barred the participation of another pro-Russian party, Patria, saying it had received illegal foreign financing.Mr. Rogozin, commenting on Twitter, said pro-Russian parties would have secured control of Parliament if Patria had been allowed on the ballot, and if it had been easier for thousands of Moldovan migrant workers in Russia to vote.According to preliminary results, with more than 97 percent of ballots counted, the pro-Russian Socialist Party was ahead with 20.7 percent, followed by the strongly pro-European Liberal Democratic Party, which is led by Prime Minister Iurie Leanca, with 20 percent.The country\u2019s Communist Party, perhaps the most resilient in the former Soviet Union, was in third place, with 17.8 percent, followed by two pro-Western parties: the Democratic Party, with 16 percent, and the Liberal Party, with 9.5 percent.Taken together, the pro-Western parties had about 45 percent of the vote, while the pro-Russian parties secured about 39 percent. Because other parties are not expected to clear the 6 percent threshold to enter Parliament, the pro-Western parties are likely to emerge with a slim, controlling majority.That said, forming a government is expected to be extremely difficult and to entail intense negotiations in the coming weeks. Although the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the ban on Patria in a ruling on Saturday, the late disqualification gave further ammunition to Russian officials who have complained of European meddling aimed at undercutting the Kremlin\u2019s influence in the former Soviet Union.Mr. Rogozin has forcefully conveyed Russia\u2019s view. Last year, on a visit to Chisinau, the Moldovan capital, he noted the country\u2019s reliance on Russian natural gas to heat homes in winter, and warned, \u201cWe hope that you will not freeze.\u201d\u201cAdd to this, the votes of supporters of the Patria party, withdrawn from the election on the eve of the vote, plus 700,000 Moldovan migrant workers in Russia whom the Chisinau authorities did not allow to vote, and you get the real weight of the Eurointegrators in this country,\u201d he wrote in his commentary. \u201cFor Chisinau, it\u2019s worth thinking about: Are you going on the correct path/road, comrades?\u201dPatria was created by Renato Usatii, a wealthy businessman with strong ties to Russia. Mr. Usatii is president of VPT-NN, a tool-and-die company that is an official supplier to Russian Railways, the national railroad. Russian Railways is controlled by one of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s closest allies.An article on Dec. 2 about a strong showing by pro-Western parties in an election in Moldova that became another contest between the West and Russia for influence in a former Soviet republic reversed the rankings and percentages of the vote received by the Liberal Democratic Party and the Democratic Party, according to preliminary results. The Liberal Democrats came in second, with 20 percent, and the Democratic Party was fourth, with 16 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Political Gamble, Greek Premier Speeds Up Presidential Vote", "Date": "2014-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Samaras\u2019s call for the Parliament to elect a new president \u2014 a largely ceremonial post \u2014 amounts to seeking a vote of confidence in his center-right government that will play out between now and the end of the year. If it succeeds, he will retain the backing he needs to continue working with the lenders that have helped keep Greece afloat, and do so before having to negotiate further budget cutbacks.If it fails, it could trigger national elections early next year, giving the left-wing Syriza opposition party, which at this point is leading in the polls, a chance to make good on its promises to steer Greece away from austerity.The decision rattled the Athens stock market, which closed down 12.78 percent, the biggest plunge since 1987. Bank shares were down 16.6 and 10-year bond yields rose above 8 percent, a level that effectively blocks Greece from raising money in the markets.It also attracted watchful concern from the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the European Central Bank, which together have negotiated the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout and domestic economic policies since the financial crisis erupted in 2010.In moving up the vote for a Greek president, Mr. Samaras is gambling that an earlier election will help him secure the 180 parliamentary votes, out of 300 seats, he needs to hold on to power for another year and a half.His announcement late on Monday came just hours after eurozone ministers approved a two-month extension on the current Greek bailout program, allowing Mr. Samaras to seek the votes he needs for the presidency ahead of any new, no doubt painful agreement with Greece\u2019s creditors. The selection of the new president had originally been anticipated to take place in February.In announcing his decision, Mr. Samaras said the aim of the election was to restore political stability.Under the Greek Constitution, if the Parliament cannot choose a president after three rounds of voting and at least a three-fifths majority, then it must be dissolved and a new general election held. Most analysts believe that Mr. Samaras is short about 25 votes of the 180 votes necessary in the third round.But Mr. Malkoutzis and many other analysts said they believed it would still be difficult for Mr. Samaras, who is holding on to an extremely thin majority in Parliament. The prime minister nominated Stavros Dimas, a 73-year-old former member of the European Commission and fellow conservative.Some analysts speculated that Mr. Samaras would not have made his move if he did not have the votes. Others suggested they were watching desperation.If a new general election is held, polls suggest that Mr. Samaras\u2019s party, New Democracy, would come in behind Syriza, though many pollsters say that there are still many undecided voters.The head of Syriza, Alexis Tsipras, has the political advantage of having had no part in the bailout agreements that have forced the government to raise taxes, cut pensions and lay off thousands of workers. Although he has long been critical of the austerity forced on Greece by Germany and other lenders, he has worked hard to moderate his image as a radical in recent months, trying to assure investors and voters that he can be trusted with power.But he has said repeatedly that he wants to break from austerity policies and restructure the government\u2019s huge debt burden, which stands at 174 percent of gross domestic product.Panos Skourletis, a spokesman for Syriza, said he did not believe Mr. Samaras would get the necessary votes. The government, he said, moved up the election so it would not have to \u201cdeal with disclosing the commitments they have toward the troika and the underpinnings of the new credit-line deal.\u201dBut what was important, he said, was that after the new elections, \u201cEurope has to rethink its strategy against the crisis. If they don\u2019t, they are risking not only Greece\u2019s future but Europe\u2019s as a whole, both financially and for the very cohesion.\u201dEver since Syriza won the European parliamentary elections in Greece last spring, Mr. Samaras has tried to distance himself from austerity measures and offer a new, more hopeful narrative.Some say that he overplayed his hand when he suggested that Greece would exit its bailout program at the end of the year, triggering a stock market plunge in October. But he was back on television in November to announce that the economy had grown 1.7 percent in the third quarter of this year.\u201cWhen the current Parliament elects a president at the end of the month the clouds will be gone,\u201d he said \u201cand the country will be ready to officially enter the post-bailout era.\u201dSince 2010 Greece has received almost $296 billion in rescue funds. But recent negotiations over the next installment and a new line of credit that can be tapped in an emergency have stalled, with Mr. Samaras complaining that the government won\u2019t accept any \u201cirrational and unjustifiable\u201d proposals.\u201cMy reading of the situation is that we will have an unbelievably polarized situation,\u201d he said, \u201cand that is dangerous for the country.\u201dDimitris Bounias and Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shale and the Falling Price of Oil", "Date": "2014-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix years ago, the price of oil went on an incredible roller-coaster ride. In January 2008, oil hovered around $90 a barrel. By July, it had reached $147 a barrel. By the end of the year, it had plunged to under $35 a barrel.Saudi Arabia, and the other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, hate that kind of volatility. When prices are too high, OPEC\u2019s customers, the petroleum importing countries, suffer economically, which means they cut back on energy use and search for alternatives to oil. But if prices go too low, many exporting countries face enormous financial problems because their economies depend on oil staying in the $100 to $130 range, according to 2015 projections.We tend to think of OPEC as a cartel whose goal is to set the price of oil \u2014 and set it high. But stability is also an important goal. Without a cartel controlling supply, oil can be the most volatile of commodities.Which, of course, we are learning anew, as we\u2019ve watched oil fall from $115 a barrel to about $60 in the last six months. In 2008, Saudi Arabia stepped in both when the price was rising rapidly and again when it dropped. And guess what happened? Nothing. Most of the rest of OPEC didn\u2019t follow Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis were exposed as having lost their ability to single-handedly control the price of oil.Part of the reason for this new Saudi attitude is that the country\u2019s leaders are tired of doing all the heavy lifting for the other OPEC members \u2014 who then keep their spigots completely open and take advantage of the high prices the Saudis are making possible. Part of it is that the Saudis are unwilling to lose market share to other countries, and they have the wherewithal to withstand lower prices for a much longer period than virtually any other exporter. But part of it is also that Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t want a repeat of 2008.\u201cThe worst thing from the Saudi point of view would be to announce a production cut, and the prices keep falling,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, the founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. It doesn\u2019t want to be seen as the emperor with no clothes.But the Saudis don\u2019t really fear shale oil. \u201cI\u2019ve heard officials in Saudi Arabia call shale a blessing,\u201d said Robert McNally, the founder and president of The Rapidan Group, who is also affiliated with the Center on Global Energy Policy. \u201cShale oil is light,\u201d he added. \u201cSaudi oil is medium and heavy, and their real competitors are the Iraqis and the Iranians.\u201d The Saudis can adjust to shale oil more easily than many other countries.In effect, shale has the potential to play the role of the \u201cswing supplier,\u201d which is the role the Saudis used to play. At a certain price, it will be uneconomical to drill for shale oil, at which point the price will stabilize. But the shale revolution is still too new for anybody to know what that price is. In a sense, what is going on now is an effort to discover how low oil has to go before shale production declines and the floor is found for the price of oil.OPEC, McNally reminded me the other day, is hardly the first group to try to control the price of oil. In the early years of the industry, John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil controlled the price. For decades before the formation of OPEC, the Railroad Commission of Texas (now the Texas Railroad Commission) would have a monthly meeting to set production quotas.More than anything else, the events of these past months, as oil has dropped and dropped again, shows that it is the market, rather than a cartel, that will dictate the price of oil for the foreseeable future.Hold onto your seatbelt.Advertisement"}

America needs to wake up and acknowledge that this is a class war, and that the middle class is losing to the superwealthy. The question is whether any change can occur with such a bought-and-paid-for, dysfunctional Congress and president. The special interests own our government. The new budget bill proves again that Wall Street banking has more power than hundreds of millions of people.\u00a0The next two years are critical. Does America rise up and fix things? The so-called race riots of the 1960s, and today, are more about income and opportunity inequality than race.For instance, by my calculation, taking away just 10 percent of the Defense Department budget could cover tuition at a public university for all American students, yet we do not do this.It would be nice to have elected officials rise to the occasion, and this could happen if the far left sees its common interests with the far-right Tea Party.

{"Headline": "China Announces Record Trade Surplus, Helped by Weak Oil Price", "Date": "2014-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s trade surplus soared in November to a new high, causing the Shanghai stock market to jump sharply again on Monday, as the steeply falling prices of oil, iron ore and other commodities reduced the cost of imports and China\u2019s exports continued to capture a growing share of world markets.China\u2019s General Administration of Customs announced on Monday that the country\u2019s trade surplus had leapt to $54.47 billion, easily breaking the previous record, set only in August, of $49.87 billion. Chinese exports have mostly maintained their competitiveness abroad this year despite rising blue-collar wages. The central bank intervened aggressively in currency markets early this year to hold down the value of the renminbi, an advantage for exporters, and appears to have done so again in recent weeks.The euphoria among stock investors appears to reflect a widespread conviction that the government will continue to stimulate the economy. Yet the export and import data on Monday showed clear signs of economic weakness even as the surplus surged.Exports were up 4.7 percent from November of last year, somewhat less than foreign economists expected, as growth in exports of mobile phones in particular slowed. Imports dropped 6.6 percent; most foreign economists had expected a small increase.Shen Jianguang, a China economist for Mizuho Securities, said that weakness in the export and import figures was likely a harbinger of broader weakness in the economic statistics for November that the Chinese government is set to issue in the coming days. But the surging stock market may actually make it harder for the central bank to take further measures to help the economy, as it could stoke market speculation.\u201cThe stock market may delay the rate-cut cycle,\u201d Mr. Shen said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy \u2014 the increase is a fever.\u201dWhile the real estate market is starting to show a few faint signs of stabilizing as the government has eased the rules on bank issuance of mortgages, the industrial sector is struggling with immense overcapacity for steel and many other goods.The computer models that most economists use to forecast import and export statistics rely heavily on indicators like surveys of purchasing managers in China and in big importing countries. These models tend not to include the effects of very large swings in commodity prices, like the steep plunge in oil prices last month, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist in the Singapore office of Capital Economics, a macroeconomic research company.But Chinese imports from the European Union also fell by 6.8 percent from November of last year. These imports consist heavily of machinery, for which investment demand is slowing, and luxury goods like French handbags and Italian cars, at a time when President Xi Jinping is pursuing an aggressive anticorruption campaign that encourages frugal living by government officials.Prices have plunged not only for imported raw materials like oil, but also for semiprocessed goods like plastic and steel that are made from oil and other commodities. But falling commodity prices have not necessarily fattened the profits of Chinese manufacturers, as ferocious competition among them and chronic overcapacity have forced them to pass much of the savings on to their customers.\u201cRaw material costs have come down recently, though it is still very competitive since the costs have come down also for other manufacturers in China,\u201d said Cherry Jiang, a sales executive at the Wuxi Redhot Industries Company, a maker of plastic lunchboxes and other plastic containers in Wuxi, a city in the eastern province of Jiangsu. \u201cHowever, it has allowed us to be more flexible on pricing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Armenia Wins Backing to Join Trade Bloc Championed by Putin", "Date": "2014-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s lower house of Parliament voted unanimously on Wednesday to approve a treaty allowing Armenia to join a trade bloc of former Soviet states that President Vladimir V. Putin has championed as an alternative to the European Union.The bloc, now called the Eurasian Economic Union, already includes Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, with Armenia and Kyrgyzstan on the path to membership. Mr. Putin envisions it as a counterweight to the European Union and a better guarantor of the region\u2019s economic interests.Tensions have emerged in recent months, however, as Russia has come under economic pressure as a result of sanctions imposed by the West over the Kremlin\u2019s intervention in Ukraine.Russia\u2019s mounting economic worries, including a steep decline in the ruble and a simultaneous slide in global oil prices, have weighed on its closest trading partners, particularly Belarus.The Russian authorities late last month banned the transit of Western products from Belarus through Russia to other countries, including Kazakhstan, partly out of concern that such shipments were being used to violate Russia\u2019s retaliatory sanctions against Europe, which prohibit the import of most European agricultural products.Belarus has since stepped up inspections in a bid to persuade Russia to ease the restrictions. But the Belarussian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, has declared publicly that Belarus would not impose restrictions that will break existing agreements with Western suppliers.\u201cWe cannot ban transit of goods to other countries through the Belarussian territory; this is a violation of all the norms of international law,\u201d he said at a recent government meeting. \u201cIf Russia does not want any goods to go through it by transit to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, China, Mongolia, Turkey, then it should ban this transit.\u201dRussia has expressed concerns that some truck shipments purportedly destined for Kazakhstan, including frozen meat, have been unloaded instead in Russia. Some Russian officials have also raised suspicions that banned European goods are being repackaged in Belarus and sold in Russia as Belarussian products, which Belarus has denied.The tensions over the extent to which Belarus and Kazakhstan are willing to support Russia in its conflict with the West over Ukraine have raised questions about the longer-term viability of the Eurasian Economic Union. Belarus and Kazakhstan must also ratify the treaty allowing Armenia to enter the bloc.Armenia, like Ukraine, had been working toward closer political and economic relations with the European Union, including steps toward a new free-trade accord.That all changed abruptly in September 2013 as Russia stepped up efforts to thwart a European Union program aimed at strengthening ties with former Soviet republics. After a meeting in Moscow that September with Mr. Putin, the Armenian president, Serzh Sargsyan, announced that he was abandoning the European talks and that his country would join Russia\u2019s economic bloc instead.His decision set off some protests in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, but the country ultimately had little choice as it is heavily dependent on Russia for economic and security assistance. The value to Armenia of joining the trade bloc has been questioned, in part because the country shares no common border with any of the other member countries.The European Union has been Armenia\u2019s main trading partner. Its economy is severely hamstrung because borders with two of its neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan, are sealed as a result of longstanding conflicts.Commercial activity with its southern neighbor, Iran, has been restricted because of international sanctions over that country\u2019s efforts to develop its nuclear program. That leaves only the northern border with Georgia fully open for trade.In remarks before the vote in the State Duma, Russia\u2019s lower chamber of Parliament, the speaker, Sergei Naryshkin, compared the economic benefits of the Eurasian Economic Union with what he described as the toxic results of Ukraine\u2019s closer ties with Europe.\u201cIn one case, that which we are discussing with you today, Eurasian integration is proceeding with utmost mutual respect, understanding of the economic interests and national traditions of partners,\u201d Mr. Naryshkin said, according to Russian news services. \u201cAnd in another case, as with our brotherly Ukraine, it is going on ignoring economic interests, national interests of the state, with violence, ruin, and even the loss of human life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Signs That Attackers Came From Within Mitigate Alarm in Chechnya", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGROZNY, Russia \u2014 In the midst of a terrorist assault on this city, one of the Islamic militants involved recorded a video explaining his motives that, strangely, left some here breathing a sigh of relief. The brief clip shows a young man claiming that a local radical Islamic group, the Caucasus Emirate, was responsible for the attack and citing local grievances related to head scarves. That allayed concerns among analysts and residents of Chechnya alike that the Islamic State, the jihadist group that rampaged across Iraq from Syria this year, might have been involved.Still, no one has ruled out an Islamic State role in Thursday\u2019s assault, in which 11 militants armed with explosives and automatic weapons seized a school and an office complex for media companies and killed 14 policemen and at least one civilian. President Vladimir V. Putin, in a speech on Thursday, hinted at a foreign hand in the assault, as has Chechnya\u2019s regional leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, who on Friday accused Ukrainian lawmakers of providing \u201cfinancing or other aid.\u201d A plot by foreign terrorists would only add to Russia\u2019s mounting list of woes that include Western sanctions and a sputtering economy. The home-brewed terrorism of Chechnya is at least a known quantity. Grozny means \u201cFearsome\u201d in Russian, but in fact it has been emerging as one of the more stable cities in this region where an independence movement led to two devastating wars with Moscow. Assaults are now rare, though a suicide bomber did kill five policemen in October. As residents ventured onto the streets on Friday, many scoffed at the notion that the attackers were foreigners. For one thing, they spoke Chechen, a diabolically difficult language for outsiders to learn.\u201cThe real root of all this is the militants could not agree among themselves to share power,\u201d and so needed to stage a high-profile act, Ruslan Zakriyev, a reporter for a religious affairs newspaper, Zori Islam, whose office was in the building captured by the militants, said in an interview. \u201cThe attackers are just the pawns.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s solve our problems with war, not dialogue,\u201d he said of the Caucasus Emirate\u2019s philosophy. He gingerly made his way past bloodstains and bullet pocks in the incinerated interior of his former office, to retrieve what belongings he could. The video was released during the attack and seemed to provide the clearest evidence of a local motive for the violence. A Chechen-speaking man says \u201cwe have spread around the city,\u201d and boasts of killing police officers. He says he is acting on behalf of a local militant leader, Aslan Byutukayev, known as Emir Khamzat. \u201cIt is an act of retaliation for oppression of Muslim women, our sisters, by Russia\u2019s minions.\u201dThat remark was taken to refer to reported threats by the Chechen government that male police officers would touch fundamentalist Sunni women as they arrested them for wearing head scarves that covered their chins as well as their hair. (Mr. Kadyrov has encouraged women to wear scarves that do not touch the chin.)The attackers on Thursday seemed familiar with the city. They infiltrated well-guarded parts of Grozny by calling three taxi cabs from the city to a nearby village, Shalazhi, tied up the drivers, then drove through checkpoints in the taxis. They wore uniforms of traffic policemen. The first shootout occurred near the city center about 1 a.m. Thursday. After that, the militants holed up in the media building and a school until the last of them were killed, around noon.The government has not released the identities, or nationalities, of most of the attackers, but did say that at least one was Chechen. Ibragim Arsanov, a school director and native of Shalazhi, said the attackers were certainly local, but did not have much support among their own people. \u201cThe social base of the fighters is minimal,\u201d he said, adding that separatist yearnings have faded as money has flowed from Moscow for reconstruction projects. Still, Aleksei Malashenko, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in a blog post for Echo of Moscow radio that it was still too early to exclude a role for the Islamic State. At the least, he wrote, the group \u201cinspired\u201d the Caucasus Emirate to make a high-profile attack. Advertisement"}

Halfway along this road one is suddenly flung backward in time, seeing faces that have a startling resemblance to the indigenous people of the pre-Columbian era. They are the Kalinago people, or Caribs, as the Europeans called them. Carrie Gibson\u2019s readable book, \u201cEmpire\u2019s Crossroads: A History of the Caribbean From Columbus to the Present Day,\u201d tells of the Europeans\u2019 first encounter with these and other Amerindians, and she explores the lingering impact of colonization on the island territories today. Gibson\u2019s research is thorough: She studied the history of the Spanish and French Caribbean for her Ph.D. at Cambridge University. And there is much for the historian and academic to chew on, including 352 pages of Caribbean history, eight pages of bibliography (merely some of the recent books she consulted), 44 pages of notes and an index covering 27 pages. But the nonspecialist need not be daunted; Gibson knows how to hold the reader\u2019s interest, and before you get too entangled in her meticulous research, she offers gems, sometimes poetic prose, often fascinating facts. The story of the Caribbean, she writes, is \u201cdappled, a ramble with shadows and light rather than a march to triumph under a blazing sun.\u201d She also describes the statue of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s first wife, Josephine, which stands in the capital of Martinique \u2014 now beheaded, the body smeared with red paint, it faces the tourist beaches of Trois-\u00celets. Josephine was suspected of persuading Napoleon to reinstate slavery in the French colonies as proof of her loyalty to France and the purity of her European blood. The portrayal of Columbus as the discoverer of the Caribbean islands has already been debunked, but Gibson goes further, presenting the Europeans as ruthless invaders whose only goal was to pillage the Caribbean islands for gold and silver; finding little metal, they enslaved the Amerindians for forced labor on \u00adsugar-cane, cocoa and tobacco plantations. Slavery, Gibson tells us, was well within the moral codes of the Old World, as the Portuguese had been enslaving Africans with the approval of the pope. Persuaded that the Amerindians were cannibals, Europeans found additional justification to subjugate and, eventually, eradicate most of them. It was Columbus and his men, though, who not only gave the Amerindians their names, but divided them into peaceful and warmongering groups \u2014 a division that Gibson contends was a mere reflection of the European success or failure in controlling them. Although \u201cthere is no evidence that anyone on any island\u201d ate human flesh, the fearsome Caribs were believed to be cannibals, a myth that persists to this day.Europeans met with resistance in the Caribbean, and Gibson debunks yet another myth of the na\u00efve native welcoming the white man. She also points out that geography and climate were major forces on the side of the natives, deterring the conquest of the islands: volcanoes, hurricanes, suffocating weather, swampy terrain, not to mention all sorts of insects, like the malaria-carrying mosquito. (Gibson notes that the Mosquito Coast got its name from the Miskito people, who early on successfully fought the Spanish.) Jamaica is hilly, so many Africans and Amerindians were able to escape slavery by hiding in caves in the hills. The density of the forest in Dominica, observable on the route from the airport to the capital, allowed many Kalinago people to survive, undetected among the thick trees. Alas, some terrain proved too hospitable; blessed with flat lands, Barbados was the perfect site for planting sugar cane, and the proximity of hardwood forests near the coast of Honduras made that country ideal for logging.There are intriguing chapters in this book about the European wars on the seas, as the English, Spanish, French, Portuguese and Dutch fought over territories and trade routes. This was the time when sailors attacked ships to plunder their goods. We know them as pirates, but there were privateers, too, with letters of marque from their monarchs giving them permission to raid enemy ships. One such privateer was Sir Francis Drake, whom, as Gibson observes, Spain would have considered a pirate. The most painful chapters in \u201cEmpire\u2019s Crossroads\u201d are Gibson\u2019s accounts of the \u201cliving death\u201d that was slavery. This brutal system may have troubled the consciences of decent men, but they often found reasons to justify the practice nonetheless. For Oliver Cromwell, conquering Hispaniola would provide England with \u201cthe means to take forward its Puritan revolution.\u201d For the men of the Enlightenment, a defense of slavery reflected a fear that the sugar economy might collapse. As early as 1700, sugar in the Caribbean was worth \u00a34 billion in today\u2019s money and quadrupled in value over the next 70 years. Britons, Gibson adds, had developed \u201ca weakness for sugar\u201d and for luxury goods bought with revenues from the crop. The British ultimately abolished slavery, in 1833, though not without pressure from the enslaved Africans who threatened to withhold their labor and, in many instances, destroyed plantations. Tracing the history of slave revolts in the Caribbean, Gibson focuses on the Haitian revolution, which cost the life of its leader, Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture; she also cites Eric Williams, the historian and first prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, who famously claimed that market economics and the Industrial Revolution, not enlightened humanitarianism, ended slavery. Given the continuing arguments for reparations, it is interesting to note that after Britain passed the Slavery Abolition Act, slave-owning planters shared a \u00a320 million compensation pot.As it happened, market economics also ushered in the end of colonial rule. \u201cAfter the Second World War,\u201d Gibson writes, \u201cBritain was exhausted \u2014 bankrupt and bomb-scarred, its commodities still on rations,\u201d and so it was more economically feasible to relinquish the colonies than resist their demands for political independence. Many from the Caribbean islands, though, trusting in the \u201cmother country,\u201d had answered the British call for help rebuilding the war-torn country and met with hostility because of the color of their skin. Color discrimination, of course, was not new in the Caribbean; during slavery, \u201cmulattos\u201d were treated better than their dark-skinned counterparts on the plantations. In his popular book \u201cOutliers,\u201d Malcolm Gladwell observes that \u201cthe brown-skinned classes of Jamaica came to fetishize their lightness. It was their great advantage.\u201d As Black Power movements swept through the islands in the second half of the 20th century, color distinctions in the political parties were abundantly clear, particularly in the twin islands of Trinidad and Tobago and in Guyana, where there are dense populations of the descendants of South Asian Indians who first came to the islands as indentured laborers. \u201cSlavery was gone,\u201d Gibson remarks, \u201cbut its inequalities remained.\u201dEMPIRE\u2019S CROSSROADSA History of the Caribbean From Columbus to the Present DayBy Carrie GibsonIllustrated. 447 pp. Atlantic Monthly Press. $28.Elizabeth Nunez is the author of eight novels, including \u201cProspero\u2019s Daughter,\u201d and a recent memoir, \u201cNot for Everyday Use.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Reversal, Germany Cools to Russian Investment", "Date": "2014-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Few countries have invested more heavily in Russia than Germany has, rushing in to exploit new trade opportunities that opened up after the Cold War ended. More than 6,000 German companies set up operations there, and Russia became a major customer for German cars, pharmaceuticals and machinery.But now the rush is going in reverse. The announcement last week by the German chemical giant BASF that it had canceled a planned deal with Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, involving natural gas extraction and distribution, was the latest example of how German companies are delaying projects and investment.Opel, the car-making unit of G.M. based in Germany, has laid off workers at its plant in St. Petersburg; Volkswagen shut down an auto plant in Kaluga intermittently because of poor demand; and Fresenius, a health care company, canceled a joint venture with Russian partners.More than a third of German companies with operations in Russia are likely to cancel investment projects, though only a small number of German companies have abandoned Russia completely, according to a survey this month by the German-Russian Chamber of Commerce.The conflict in Ukraine has rattled Germany\u2019s leaders as perhaps no others outside Russia. It is not just business that has been put on hold: Countless forums for partnership like major political gatherings have been trimmed back or put on ice. Although Germany\u2019s politicians continue to lead diplomatic attempts to ease the Ukraine crisis, trust in Moscow has evaporated. Everyone knows that it will take a long time to repair a rift that has revived fears of a new division of Europe \u2014 roughly, pitting Russia against the European Union \u2014 and markedly reduced commerce once considered a reliable source of growth.The impact on Russia is broader, because it is much more dependent on German goods and investment than vice versa. Russia is hobbled by economic sanctions for its intervention in Ukraine, the devalued ruble and a severe drop in the price of oil, its main export. Russia is expected to suffer a steep recession next year, while Germany is forecast to grow 1 percent.But Russia\u2019s problems have helped slow Germany\u2019s momentum. Exports to Russia fell 22 percent through October compared with the same period a year earlier. Ten percent of all German companies export to Russia, and the lost sales are another setback at a time when Germany is struggling to improve economic growth.The uncertainty hanging over Germany\u2019s strong business ties with Russia, which are more than double the value of Russian trade with the United States, is in marked contrast to the optimism and relative stability of recent years. And it has been reflected in increasingly acrimonious exchanges in Germany\u2019s political, diplomatic and intellectual elite over how to shape relations with Moscow.Last weekend, the two most prominent Social Democrats in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s grand coalition government of center right and center left \u2014 the party leader, Sigmar Gabriel, and the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier \u2014 voiced concern that sanctions might hobble the stricken Russian economy, and they opposed tightening them.Ms. Merkel, clearly frustrated with the behavior of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, has so far taken a harder line. But the potential for conflict within Ms. Merkel\u2019s government complicates her efforts to use Germany\u2019s close ties with Russia as leverage to fashion a solution to the crisis in Ukraine.Business groups, normally strong backers of Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, have agreed with the Social Democrats on Russia and warned against using economic means to put pressure on Mr. Putin.\u201cSanctions are not the proper means to resolve this political crisis,\u201d Eckhard Cordes, a former Daimler executive who is chairman of the Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, which represents companies doing business in the former Soviet bloc, said in an email. \u201cThe West cannot have an interest in destabilizing the Russian economy or Russian politics.\u201dBut sanctions are hardly the only factor destabilizing the Russian economy. Well before Russia annexed Crimea, German businesses had become disenchanted with what they saw as increased hostility to foreign investors.Allianz, Germany\u2019s largest insurance company, stopped selling auto policies in Russia last year after a change in Russian law that allowed disgruntled customers to sue in local courts. The courts sometimes issued judgments without even notifying insurers that there was a complaint. Allianz, based in Munich, continues to sell life insurance and other policies in Russia.The business climate in Russia has continued to deteriorate, at least in the eyes of German investors. Fresenius, a health care company listed on Germany\u2019s blue chip DAX 30 index, canceled a planned pharmaceutical joint venture with a Russian partner last month, citing \u201cchanging political and regulatory circumstances.\u201dShares of Stada, a maker of generic drugs based in Bad Vilbel, near Frankfurt, have fallen by more than a quarter since June, in part because of a 19 percent decline in sales in Russia, one of the company\u2019s most important markets.Everyone \u201cis moving in very low gear,\u201d said a businessman who has had dealings with Russia for the past decade. Like many people operating in Russia, he did not want to be quoted by name for fear of upsetting already delicate ties.\u201cThe Germans want to be there,\u201d the man said. But \u201cthey\u2019re afraid of what the volatile Russian market is going to do.\u201dThe number of German companies abandoning Russia remains small, about 3 percent of the total, according to the German-Russian Chamber of Commerce. Most companies hope that the Ukraine crisis will blow over, and they will be able to return to business as usual.A few companies continue to invest. Schaeffler, a German maker of ball bearings and other components used by the auto industry, opened a factory in October, its first in Russia, in Ulyanovsk, about 550 miles east of Moscow.But 41 percent of German companies in Russia have slowed investment there, according to the survey of 200 firms by the chamber of commerce, while 36 percent said they would cancel projects unless conditions improved. And 28 percent said they planned to dismiss Russian workers.The Russian market has turned sour for German automakers. Opel said in September it would cut production at its main factory in St. Petersburg, where it makes Opel Astra and Chevrolet Cruze cars, eliminating a shift and 500 out of 1,600 jobs.Volkswagen halted production for 15 days at a plant in Kaluga in recent months, in addition to the usual Christmas and New Year\u2019s shutdown. The company said in a statement it remained committed to Russia but was \u201cwatching the market with concern.\u201dIncluding other companies like BMW, Mercedes and Ford of Europe, which is based in Cologne, German automakers will lose 15 billion euros, or about $18.3 billion, in Russian sales and \u20ac600 million in profit through 2017, according to estimates by Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen.Other industries are also suffering. Metro, a German retailer, postponed a listing of its Russian unit on the London stock exchange, which would have raised cash for more expansion in the country. Otto, a catalog retailer and online rival to Amazon, has been forced to raise prices for Russian customers to compensate for the plunge in the ruble, which has recovered somewhat during the last week but is still down 30 percent since June.The economic fallout has had political repercussions in Germany, where memories linger of the carnage that the Nazis and Soviets inflicted on each other during World War II. Fear of renewed tension or even conflict is palpable, and understanding for Mr. Putin is greater than in the United States.Political tensions are likely to intensify as sanctions against Russia come up for renewal in March, a year after Moscow annexed Crimea.\u201cAnyone who believes that forcing Russia economically to its knees will lead to more security in Europe is wrong,\u201d Mr. Steinmeier, the foreign minister, told the weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel. Having Russia\u2019s economy in chaos \u201ccannot be in our interest,\u201d he added.Mr. Gabriel, the leader of the Social Democrats, said pointedly that calls for intensifying sanctions were wrong.Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, Ms. Merkel\u2019s predecessor as chancellor and an avowed friend of Mr. Putin, was among 60 prominent signatories of an appeal entitled, \u201cAgain War in Europe?/Not in Our Name.\u201dThat appeal drew a blistering response from Bert Hoppe, a writer from former East Germany, who accused the signatories of paying scant attention to Ukraine\u2019s desire for independence and acknowledging only Russia as the architect of Nazi defeat and later reconciliation with Germany.These are well-worn arguments. That they have resurfaced will not make it easier to re-establish the close ties that many Germans and Russians had taken for granted in the 25 years since the Berlin Wall fell.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Alison Smale from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuba\u2019s Economy at a Crossroads ", "Date": "2014-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn July 2007, while serving as acting president as his brother underwent medical treatment, Ra\u00fal Castro delivered a startling indictment of the Cuban economy when he railed about the inefficiencies of the dairy industry. His description of the onerous and expensive mechanism to get milk from cows to dinner tables was old news to Cubans, who have been subjected for decades to a centrally planned economy that is among the world\u2019s most dysfunctional and anomalous. It soon became clear that Mr. Castro\u2019s unexpected candor that day signaled the start of a transformational era for the island\u2019s economy.After Fidel Castro ceded power to his brother in 2008, the government initiated reforms that have allowed Cubans to start building livelihoods that are not wholly subject to state control. The pace has been halting, with plenty of backtracking from the government\u2019s old guard, which views further liberalization of the economy as an abdication of the socialist system Fidel Castro made sacrosanct.To date, the Obama administration has watched the reforms with skepticism. The White House has eased restrictions on remittances and travel to the island, but it has done relatively little else to pare down the web of sanctions the United States has imposed on Cuba for decades.President Obama could help expand the role of Cuba\u2019s small but growing entrepreneurial class by relaxing sanctions through executive authority and working with the growing number of lawmakers who want to expand business with Cuba. The White House could start that process by removing Cuba from the State Department list of countries that sponsor terrorist organizations and making it easier for Americans to provide start up-capital for independent small businesses. Doing that would empower Cuban-Americans to play a more robust role in the island\u2019s economic transformation. More significantly, it would gradually erode the Cuban government\u2019s ability to blame Washington for the shortcomings of an economy that is failing its citizens largely as a result of its own policies.\u0095\u2022Before Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, Cuba\u2019s economy was heavily reliant on the United States, which bought the bulk of its main export, sugar. American tourists flocked to the island, lured by its proximity, tropical weather and raucous night life.After the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista, an authoritarian leader who had protected American commercial interests on the island, Fidel Castro\u2019s government asserted control over virtually every segment of the economy. It seized land and assets from American companies and vowed to guarantee all citizens housing, health care and education. Communism brought an ever more anemic and backward economy, one propped up largely by Moscow. But after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, so did Cuba\u2019s economy.Cubans euphemistically call the stark deprivation of the 1990s the \u201cspecial period,\u201d a time when the Cuban government was forced to allow in some foreign investment and authorize limited private-sector employment. In 1999, Havana found a new benefactor in the newly elected president of Venezuela, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2014 which gave Cuban officials the ability to retighten state control of the economy. But in the last two years Venezuela, which provides heavily subsidized oil to Cuba in exchange for medical services, has struggled with a worsening economic and political crisis, which could force it to cut off subsidies to Havana.The precariousness of that relationship has added urgency to the debate over how fast the Cuban government needs to implement the reforms Ra\u00fal Castro endorsed. Old-guard leaders warn that a liberalized market economy could turn Cuba into a less egalitarian society and provide an opening for the United States to destabilize the government through a flood of private investment. Reformists, including some of the country\u2019s leading economists, say the current state of the economy is untenable.\u0095\u2022Wages in Cuba are worth roughly 28 percent of what they were before the collapse of the Soviet Union, according to the Center for the Study of the Cuban Economy at the state-run University of Havana. The devaluation has turned workplace theft into a major problem. It has also led tens of thousands of Cuban professionals to emigrate to the United States and elsewhere in Latin America in recent years in search of a better life. The country\u2019s birthrate is declining, while its elderly are living longer.The agricultural sector remains stymied by outdated technology and byzantine policies. A foreign investment law Cuba\u2019s National Assembly approved in March has yet to deliver a single deal. Adding to the challenges, the Cuban government has pledged to do away soon with its dual-currency system (which includes a dollar-pegged peso established in the 1990s when tourism opened up), a process that could drive up inflation. Yet against the picture of stagnation is the growth of a new class of private-sector employees, now nearly 500,000 strong. That\u2019s not a huge number in a nation of 11 million, but they are a marvel of ingenuity in a place where running a private restaurant requires buying virtually all ingredients on the black market. Basic staples, like potatoes, must be purchased as contraband in Cuba.Many of those building small businesses, such as bed-and-breakfasts, are Cubans who returned with savings earned abroad and those with relatives outside the country who provided start-up capital. All struggle with the bureaucracy, since they are unable to import legally items as basic as mattresses and pillows. Bringing items from the United States is onerous and complicated by American sanctions. Cuban authorities appear conflicted about the growing private sector. While they welcome the employment and tax revenue it generates, bureaucrats are throttling businesses that are doing particularly well and forcing some to become joint ventures with the state. The underlying message seems to be: We want prosperity but not overly prosperous individuals.Washington could empower the reformist camp by making it easier for Cuban entrepreneurs to get external financing and business training. That type of engagement is unlikely to succeed unless the United States abandons its policy of regime change. Cuba\u2019s economic transformation may be proceeding slowly, but it could well lead to a more open society. For now, continued antagonism from Washington is only helping the old guard.For a Spanish version and other editorials in the series,\ngo to nytimes.com/cubastartLeer en espa\u00f1ol (Read in Spanish) \u00bbAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of \u2018Welfare Chauvinism\u2019", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe same economic and cultural forces that have fractured political parties on the left and on the right in Europe are disrupting the Democratic and Republican Parties here.The United States and Europe reveal the contrasting ways in which political systems in advanced democracies cope with factors as diverse as globalization, depressed wages, cultural tension, welfare policy, immigration and nontraditional family structures, along with racial, ethnic and religious division.In the United States, the besieged two-party system has remained intact, protected by a 200-year-old tradition and an electoral system that cuts short any bid to create a viable third party.There are two major costs to this stability: recurrent gridlock, which constricts legislative action, and a failure to provide full representation to the most aggrieved constituencies.European democracies have taken a different path.Parliamentary elections, often in conjunction with proportional representation, have allowed multiple parties \u2014 at both ends of the political spectrum \u2014 to flourish. In many cases, the European system has empowered anti-immigrant populist parties on the right. These parties have adopted a strategy that might seem strange on its face but actually makes sense, according to the logic of their grievances: exclusionary nationalism combined with generous support for safety-net programs available only to legal residents.Here and abroad, there are striking similarities in the dynamic that is forcing major adjustments in the political system.The traditional European social democratic left and the Democratic Party are both struggling to address the often conflicting interests of a socially liberal elite and an economically pressed lower class.Left-of-center parties have been increasingly hampered by cultural cleavages relating to increasing ethnic heterogeneity, the free movement of labour and open migration systems, the rise of new forms of politicized and assertive religious radicalism, and an apparent conflict between \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d and \u201ccommunitarian\u201d interests. The identities and solidarities on which social democracy in Europe has been built are under increasing strain. New actors on the far left and far right, as well as astutely positioned conservative and Christian democratic parties, will not hesitate to capitalize on the struggle to craft a clear narrative \u2013 however myopic and divisive.Cramme and Diamond then ask:Are social democrats capable of developing a governing strategy that can live up to these enormous challenges? Although the nation-state has become the principal bastion in the fight against the financial and economic crisis, its \u201cgolden age\u201d is irrefutably drawing to a close.Kitschelt points out that over the past 40 years, multiple parties have emerged in Europe to fill the vacuum. The result is that voters can choose candidates from as many as eight parties. The most powerful insurgents are parties on the radical right, which have been propelled in large part by opposition to immigration.In contrast, voters of all ideological stripes in the United States realistically have just three choices: They can vote for a Democrat, vote for a Republican or stay home. There are no institutionally competitive third parties, and recent challenges to the two-party system \u2013 Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996, John B. Anderson in 1980 and George Wallace in 1968 \u2013 are rare and quickly fade.Despite the contrast between presidential and parliamentary political systems, the parallels between the United States and Europe are clear.Take England.These changes, Ford and Goodwin write, \u201chave pushed to the margins a class of voters who we describe as the \u2018left behind\u2019: older, working-class white voters with few educational quali\ufb01cations.\u201d Britain is concurrently undergoinglong-term generational changes in the values that guide British society and shape the outlook of voters. These value shifts have also left older white working-class voters behind, as a worldview which was once seen as mainstream has become regarded as parochial and intolerant by the younger, university-educated, more socially liberal elites who de\ufb01ne the political consensus of twenty-\ufb01rst-century Britain.The parallel with white working-class voters in the United States who have moved into Republican columns is clear.One side \u201cdraws disproportionate support from the salaried middle class, notably socio-cultural professionals\u201d while the other \u201cis rallied by small-business owners, production and service workers.\u201d The authors argue that whilesmall-business owners and workers prefer cultural demarcation and defend national traditions, salaried professionals strongly favor international integration and multi-culturalism.Their analysis, \u201cFrom Welfare State to Opportunity State,\u201d describes how the emergence of \u201ca more profound, if nuanced, politics of identify\u201d is fracturing the European left from two directions.On one side, \u201cmiddle-class progressive-values voters and the younger generation place an ever-increasing importance on a tolerant society and support equality for gays, promote multiculturalism, and express concern for the environment.\u201d These \u201cpostmaterialist voters are commonly among the main beneficiaries of the globalization of the economy.\u201dOn the other side, the report\u2019s authors contend, the \u201cnegative politics of identity works to instill animosity, often among those whose economic fortunes and security have declined,\u201d toward political elites, minorities \u201cand those with an alternative lifestyle, blaming them for the decline in moral values, increased economic competition for good and bad jobs and for declining and inefficient public services.\u201dThe result, according to Browne, Halpin and Teixeira, is thatthe new politics of identity traps progressives on both sides. Whatever political position they adopt is bound to alienate either their working-class voters, who tend to be more conservative with regards to values, or progressive-values voters and the millennial generation, who are turned off by the more nationalistic rhetoric that appeals to the traditional or core voter base.UKIP will ensure the N.H.S. is free at the point of delivery and time of need for all U.K. residents.We will ensure that G.P.s\u2019 surgeries are open at least one evening per week, where there is demand for it.UKIP opposes plans to charge patients for visiting their G.P.We will ensure that visitors to the U.K., and migrants until they have paid N.I. for five years, have N.H.S.-approved private health insurance as a condition of entry to the U.K., saving the N.H.S. \u00a32bn pa. UKIP will commit to spending \u00a3200m of the \u00a32bn saving to end hospital car-parking charges in England.The problem is the total opening of borders and allowing the law of the jungle to prevail: The further a company goes today to find slaves, which it then treats like animals and pays a pittance, without regard for environmental laws, the more it earns.The adoption of \u201cwelfare chauvinism\u201d by parties on the European right raises significant questions about the two-party system here.Policies along the lines of those now proffered by the European right \u2014 welfare for the legitimately needy while cutting off undocumented immigrants and the \u201cundeserving poor,\u201d trade policies protecting American jobs and higher wages for the domestic work force \u2014 would arguably be more in line with the priorities of Americans who hold jobs in automation and import-threatened industries than the current priorities of either the Democratic or Republican Parties.In practice, deep ideological and partisan disagreements in the United States about the existence of the \u201clegitimately needy\u201d and the \u201cdeserving poor,\u201d as well as quarrels about the necessity of protection from free trade for unionized workers, prevent support for a European-type right populist agenda by the conservative wing of the Republican Party or the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.If the goal of democratic politics is to give voice to competing constituencies, then multiple parties provide one means of achieving this end.That said, the American two-party system, when it works, forces politicians and the public to submit to a multi-step process requiring competing interests to compromise. The first stage is the building of Democratic and Republican coalitions with the aim of winning elections. The second is in the actual process of governing, which, under rules granting minority interests veto power (or close to it) requires negotiation to reach agreement.The current failings of the American system are less the fault of politics per se than of the irreconcilability of the conflicts that politicians are forced to reckon with. Globalization and technological advance are driving punitive employment practices that no one has figured out how to address. Illegal immigration by men and women determined to raise their living standards is difficult if not impossible to restrain. Social-cultural issues like abortion and same-sex marriage involve competing moral absolutes that do not lend themselves to compromise. Perhaps even more significant, the causes of poverty and inequality remain bitterly disputed.It may be that democracies are not at present equipped to solve the problems advanced nations face. Can the United States reach a consensus on the racial, economic, ethnic and cultural clashes that are rubbing the American political system raw? The single most important advantage of our system is its permanence and its imperviousness to transient change. The issues the system now confronts will take time to resolve. Doing so will require the continuing evolution of an electorate willing to deal with a new historical order, as opposed to an electorate at war with it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Top Target of China\u2019s Graft Purge Gets Life in Prison", "Date": "2014-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe former official, Liu Tienan, was one of the first targets of China\u2019s continuing anticorruption campaign and is one of the highest-ranking bureaucrats to have been sent to prison because of it. Mr. Liu was the deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, the main government agency that helps set and carry out economic policy, until his removal last year. He is also a former head of the National Energy Administration.The court said Mr. Liu had accepted bribes of nearly $5.8 million from 2002 to 2012. The bribes were given to him directly or through his son, Liu Decheng, according to Xinhua.Mr. Liu was one of the first and most visible targets of the anticorruption campaign begun by President Xi Jinping, who became leader of the Communist Party in November 2012. Mr. Xi has vowed to take down both \u201ctigers\u201d and \u201cflies\u201d \u2014 that is, powerful and minor officials. His campaign is allowing him to consolidate power, get rid of his political enemies and bring discipline to the party, whose officials are often derided by ordinary Chinese as corrupt and removed from the realities of society.Some analysts of Chinese politics say the purge of Mr. Liu could signal preparations by Mr. Xi and other leaders to push forward ambitious economic policies, since the gridlock inside the bureaucracy of the National Development and Reform Commission is believed to be a major obstacle to further liberalizing China\u2019s quasi-command economy.The Xinhua report said Mr. Liu was a benefactor of four companies, after presumably taking bribes from them. The trial, which took place at the Langfang Intermediate People\u2019s Court in Hebei Province, ended in September, but the court did not announce a verdict or sentence until Wednesday. In any case, a guilty verdict is virtually a foregone conclusion in judicial cases involving high-level corruption, scholars of the Chinese legal system say.Advertisement"}

In just over two decades, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been almost halved. That\u2019s not to say extreme poverty has ended. According to the World Bank\u2019s analysis, there are still roughly one billion people whose total income is below that threshold \u2014 a level of material deprivation that many in the developed world can scarcely imagine.What\u2019s behind the shift? Rising incomes in India and China are a major factor. Together, those two countries lifted 232 million people out of extreme poverty from 2008 to 2011 alone, according to the World Bank analysis. India, however, also faces the biggest challenge: It accounts for 30 percent of all people still living in extreme poverty.

{"Headline": "Our Series on the Decline of Work: An Introduction", "Date": "2014-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonemployedThe decline of work is one of the defining \u2014 and most distressing \u2014 economic developments of recent decades. It\u2019s also one of the least understood.For men, the decline has been occurring since the 1960s, when only about 5 percent of those between the ages of 25 and 54 did not work. Today, 16 percent of these men, supposedly in the prime working years of their lives, do not work. For women, the decline of work is more recent and more modest, dating only to 2000.None of the government\u2019s official statistics on unemployment fully capture the trend. And economists say they can\u2019t easily explain it. Yes, there are more Americans than there used to be who aren\u2019t working and aren\u2019t looking for a job out of discouragement. But there are also more in nearly every other category of nonemployment, including those who consider themselves disabled and those who are voluntarily unemployed: retired early, on an extended break, in school, taking care of family. The improving economy of the last few years has not been strong enough to bring most of them back into the work force.The decision about whether to work \u2014 when it is a decision \u2014 is, of course, an individual one. Many people who aren\u2019t working today are happier and better off as a result. But the poll makes clear that many of today\u2019s nonworking Americans are somewhere between conflicted and deeply unhappy about it. They want better-paying job options or different, more flexible ones.Over the last 15 years \u2014 not to mention the last 50 \u2014 the economy has gone through booms and busts, but the long-term rise of nonemployment has outlasted every cycle. It\u2019s a central reason that we now live in a country where most people are disappointed with the economy and with the standard of living.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Over All, Eurozone Economy Is Still Growing, Survey Finds", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The eurozone economy is still expanding, private-sector data showed on Tuesday, even as France and Germany registered weakness.The survey pointed to weakness at the so-called core of the eurozone, with German companies reporting the smallest increase in business activity since June 2013, and activity declining in France for an eighth consecutive month. The purchasing managers\u2019 survey does not correlate precisely with gross domestic product, but it does provide a widely watched real-time indicator of economic activity in the region.A separate survey on investor and analyst confidence from the ZEW Center for European Economic Research nonetheless gave grounds for optimism about Germany. The ZEW sentiment indicator, based on the outlook for the next six months, rose to 34.9 points in December from 11.5 in November.Clemens Fuest, president of the institute, said the data showed that confidence in Germany seemed to be returning as a result of \u201cfavorable economic conditions such as the weak euro and the low crude oil price.\u201dThe latest purchasing managers\u2019 report does nothing to change the picture of an economy for which there are no obvious sources of new demand. Austerity policies have curtailed government outlays, businesses are unwilling to invest amid uncertain prospects, and consumer spending has been held in check by an average jobless rate in the eurozone of 11.5 percent.\u201cTo have growth substantially above this level will require a bigger improvement in confidence,\u201d Mr. Martinez said, adding that this was unlikely in the near term. In 2015, policy uncertainty, concerns about elections in Greece and Spain, and problems in emerging markets are all likely to weigh on growth, he said.\u201cAusterity fatigue is setting in,\u201d he said, \u201cbut governments have no room to maneuver\u201d on fiscal spending. The best that can be hoped for, he added, is that the speed of fiscal consolidation eases further, as \u201cfiscal stimulus is not on the table.\u201dThe sole glimmer of hope at the moment might be the sharp decline in oil prices, which translates imperfectly into increased consumer spending power. But lower oil prices also mean more downward pressure on prices.Fitch Ratings last week cut its credit rating for France to AA from AA+, warning that \u201cthe weak outlook for the French economy impairs the prospects for fiscal consolidation and stabilizing the public debt ratio.\u201d That has had little effect on French borrowing costs, which are hovering near record lows.The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of eurozone blue chips, was little changed after the report, with the euro gaining 0.5 percent against the dollar to $1.2495.Advertisement"}

But not for Jos\u00e9 Guti\u00e9rrez.He works as a busboy in Manhattan, clearing plates and wiping tables at an Italian restaurant for about $450 a week when the tips are good. It is not enough to keep groceries in the refrigerator, he said, barely enough to cover the rent.So his heart sank when his 6-year-old daughter handed him her Christmas list. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be joining the throngs of shoppers crowding into toy stores, filling shopping bags with their children\u2019s dreams.Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez has not had a raise in five years and has never received a holiday bonus. On Saturday morning, he was lining up for rice, eggs and other groceries at a food pantry in the South Bronx. The growing economy has yet to buoy his family.The newest federal statistics on hunger show that one in six people in this city, or about 1.4 million people, could not afford a consistent, adequate supply of food throughout the year during the three-year period from 2011 through 2013, a time of economic recovery.\u201cMy lines are getting longer,\u201d said Sandra Reyes, who runs the food pantry and soup kitchen at the Caldwell Temple A.M.E. Zion Church in the South Bronx. Ms. Reyes said the food pantry provides groceries to about 200 families \u2014 including Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s \u2014 each month and the soup kitchen prepares hot meals for 2,400 people a month.The need outpaces the supply. Every month, she turns away 80 to 100 people who arrive at the food pantry. Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez, who has a wife and two girls, is thankful that he has never had to leave empty-handed.He receives food stamps \u2014 $180 a month, down from $200 before the federal cuts \u2014 but he still cannot afford to feed his family. He counts on the food pantry to get through the month.\u201cWe work very hard and still the money is not enough,\u201d said Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez, 52, who said he is allotted only 30 hours a week by his boss, despite his requests for more work.Erycka de Jes\u00fas, a single mother of four in Queens, said that so many people rely on food pantries these days that she no longer feels ashamed to go.\u201cI feel like the face of the new New Yorker,\u201d said Ms. de Jes\u00fas, who had been unemployed for several years but recently found a job as an outreach coordinator for a nonprofit agency. \u201cIt\u2019s not something to be proud of, but it is the status quo right now, not just for my family, but for a lot of people.\u201dMr. Guti\u00e9rrez said he was used to struggling. He and his family share their three-bedroom apartment with his brother-in-law and a cousin to help cover the rent. He rarely buys new clothes and rarely takes time off because he cannot afford to lose a day\u2019s pay.Even so, he said, he \u201calmost died\u201d when his little girl presented him with her long wish list, which included a Minnie Mouse House, a Princess guitar, a castle and other toys.He plans to give her a winter coat and one toy on her list.

And how about those experimental tests, or the car for the chief of staff?\u201cI\u2019ll send you the information right away,\u201d answered the Ebola czar, Dr. Sakoba Keita, cradling his head in his hands. After 15 minutes, the president hung up. A rueful smile played on the doctor\u2019s lips. It was 5:30 in the afternoon, but the day was far from over. The president called his Ebola point man back 10 minutes later with more questions.The change of heart has been sharp. At the start of the outbreak, Mr. Cond\u00e9 was incredulous, denying its seriousness and wasting crucial weeks that could have helped contain it.Predicting \u201crapid and final success\u201d in late March, he said the situation was \u201cwell under control\u201d only a month later, even as health officials under him massaged the numbers to avoid scaring off much-needed investors in his impoverished nation, senior international health officials said.\u201cWhen you are at war, how can you think of anything else?\u201d Mr. Cond\u00e9 said, leaning forward, describing his battle with Ebola in the rapid staccato delivery for which he is known.A new coup is never far from his thoughts. During a news conference on Ebola last month, he veered off to warn that \u201cthose who are dreaming of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, they are kidding themselves.\u201dThe amount of gas needed for motorcycles carrying disease monitors, the benefits of camera thermometers versus hand-held ones, the construction details for treatment centers, the vehicles to transport patient samples \u2014 nothing is too small to escape his attention.Not trusting his own bureaucracy \u2014 the president is curtly dismissive of his own aides, even in front of strangers \u2014 Mr. Cond\u00e9 has created what amounts to an alternative one, according to diplomats and international health officials.\u201cHe\u2019s in a trap,\u201d said a senior diplomat here. \u201cThere is no bureaucracy to carry out his writ. So he builds parallel structures with some individual.\u201dQuestions and answers on the scale of the outbreak and the science of the Ebola virus.\u201cAs far as Guinea is concerned, it is me who decides,\u201d Mr. Cond\u00e9 said. \u201cWhat is it that we need? I will fight to get it.\u201dSome wonder if he is too closely involved.\u201cWhat is hallucinatory here is that it is the president who is managing the epidemic,\u201d said the Doctors Without Borders chief of mission here, Marc Poncin. \u201cHe\u2019s implicating himself too directly in everything.\u201dRecently angered that work was proceeding too slowly on a treatment center, Mr. Cond\u00e9 \u201cthreatened jokingly to put the guy in jail if he didn\u2019t start construction immediately,\u201d Mr. Poncin recalled.\u201cHe is in a hurry,\u201d Dr. Keita said.It was not always so. At first, \u201cthere was pressure to downplay,\u201d said a C.D.C. official who was not authorized to speak publicly. So \u201cthere was a decision by the government; they removed probable and suspect cases\u201d from the official disease tally, the official said, eliminating two categories essential for assessing the extent of the outbreak.\u201cWe need to not scare people and companies and airlines,\u201d the C.D.C. official recalled the Guinean Health Ministry official leading the response saying. \u201cHe spoke of patriotic duty.\u201dFor many Ebola victims, it is difficult, if not impossible, to get an official test to confirm the virus. But Dr. Aboubacar Sidiki Diakit\u00e9, the Health Ministry official leading the response at the time, argued that only confirmed cases would be understood by the public.\u201cWhen you speak of \u2018probable, suspect and confirmed,\u2019 the population doesn\u2019t understand what is \u2018probable\u2019 and \u2018suspect,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dr. Diakit\u00e9 said in an interview last week. \u201cYou have to understand the structure of Guinean society. You\u2019re not talking about intellectuals.\u201dDr. Diakit\u00e9 added that \u201cyou have to communicate for everybody\u201d and that \u201cwe were in that logic: positive communication.\u201dAs for Mr. Cond\u00e9\u2019s handling of the crisis early on, \u201che didn\u2019t want to see things directly,\u201d said Mr. Poncin of Doctors Without Borders. \u201cHe thought it could be managed.\u201dThat response didn\u2019t work. The disease was festering in Guinea\u2019s remote villages and spreading into Sierra Leone and Liberia, fueling the epidemic.By August, with Guinea\u2019s neighbors in Ivory Coast and Senegal closing their borders, its economy going into reverse and Ebola deaths piling up, the president underwent a conversion in desperation, according to diplomats and health officials.\u201cIn August, I think he realized the gravity of the situation,\u201d Mr. Poncin said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he is interesting, because he admitted in front of everybody that he had been wrong.\u201dNow, Dr. Keita, the Ebola czar, speaks to the president \u201cfour or five times a day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo yes, there are close relations between me and him,\u201d he said.There is still much to be done: The authorities, with international help, are installing provisional treatment centers in hot spots where the disease is smoldering.Mr. Poncin said there had been a new \u201cdeterioration\u201d in Guinea, with a sharp increase in cases likely and the spread of the disease into relatively unaffected regions.\u201cI have got to keep him very closely informed,\u201d Dr. Keita said of the president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wrinkle-Free Suit, Economy to First Class", "Date": "2014-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHaving endured eight hours in airborne steerage, you arrive unrested, with knees that need oiling, your sinuses a desert. It was late night in your hometown when you departed. On arrival in another part of the world, it is someone else\u2019s morning.The locals in this place \u2014 let\u2019s call it Milan, though Hong Kong would do, or Tokyo or London \u2014 having had their requisite shut-eye, will appear bright and chipper and freshly showered as they down the day\u2019s first dose of caffeine.You pray your own clothes survived the journey in better shape than you did. No matter how tidily you packed your suit, following the guidelines we\u2019ve all been taught \u2014 turn sleeves and jacket inside out, flip up lapel, fold jacket in half lengthwise, pad lightly with tissue paper \u2014 the immutable reality is this: Your clothes are going to emerge wrinkled. And you will make the best of a bad situation.Or anyway that used to be the case.Somehow, seemingly while no one was paying particular attention, a credible version of what used to be a sartorial oxymoron \u2014 the wrinkle-free travel suit \u2014 crept onto the scene.Taking note of a revised work-world reality, that of an increasingly global and mobile business population, designers and manufacturers at points across the cost spectrum have applied themselves to making sure you do not arrive at that all-important meeting looking like a schlump.Perhaps the best part of this new turn is that its underlying principles date not to the digital age but to an earlier time \u2014 say, the Upper Paleolithic Era, or whenever in deep history people first began spinning yarn.\u201cThe three-ply yarn we use is woven specially for us at an Italian mill, and it is highly twisted,\u201d Frank Muytjens, the J. Crew men\u2019s wear director, said recently, referring to a new line of popular Ludlow and Crosby style suits made purposely for travel and introduced in July.Science has long understood that the molecular strands making up wool fiber are inherently flexible and springy. So, instinctively, has anyone who ever petted a lamb. \u201cThe more tightly you twist the fiber, the more it wants to go back to its original state,\u201d Mr. Muytjens said. And while the same cannot be said of the traveler, the mere fact of arriving at meetings in presentable clothes does tend to restore a jet-lagged traveler\u2019s battered spirits.J. Crew is far from the only retailer venturing into this arena. Having provided the fashion industry with top-quality woolens for decades, the mills of Ermenegildo Zegna have turned out fabrics that are engineered to withstand suitcase incarceration and the red wine spills that are as inevitable a feature of business travel as neck pillows and Cinnabon. Recently the Zegna label itself has increased its offerings of smartly tailored travel suits in many weights and fabrications.So, too, have mainstream labels from Burberry and Brooks Brothers to cult favorites like Brunello Cucinelli and Luigi Bianchi Mantova, a stealth go-to for editors who follow the international men\u2019s wear circuit.Up in the nosebleed price section are offerings like an elegant dark-blue single-breasted Cucinelli suit with pick-stitched lapels, a ticket pocket subtly referring to such anachronisms of travel as ticket stubs, and an overall aura of anonymity.\u201cEven before we started to incorporate a travel jacket into our collections, I always wore an ultralight wool jacket that stayed practically intact no matter how much I wore it and moved,\u201d Brunello Cucinelli emailed from his headquarters in Solomeo, Italy. His personal experience with that jacket prompted him to branch out into suits, he added. The result, in wool and silk manufactured by Loro Piana, is both featherlight (the jacket weights 150 grams) and improbably durable.\u201cYou can even fold it into a small compartment, shake it off and hang it, and it will return to its original wrinkle-free look,\u201d Mr. Cucinelli said.Having road-tested a loaner suit, this reporter can confirm that the fabric possesses such miraculous properties of wrinkle-resistance, you could sleep on a park bench wearing one and wake up looking ready to start multitasking. And at $4,285, that\u2019s how it should be.\u201cThe way guys are dressing up more, everyone wants to be prepared and on their toes,\u201d the designer Todd Snyder said recently. \u201cIn the last five years, I\u2019ve seen a return to the younger generation picking up where our fathers left off in terms of dressing the part, but with a new set of rules.\u201dThose rules, said Nick Sullivan, fashion director of Esquire, accommodate revised conventions of business dress (like the now universally adopted clich\u00e9 of blazers with jeans) and a wider latitude for socially acceptable rumpling (while conceding that for what the designer Tim Coppens called \u201cceremonial occasions,\u201d like weddings, funerals and job interviews, there will never be a substitute for a classic suit).\u201cA man can wear an unlined blazer off the plane, and if it\u2019s a bit creased that\u2019s part of the look,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, who customarily wears either jacket or suit for travel, favoring unlined, garment-dyed $700 jackets from L.B.M. 1911 or the sleek $1,300 travel suits from Luigi Bianchi Mantova, made from so-called high-twist woolens produced by Zegna mills.\u201cIt used to be that people put Lycra in travel suits so they held their shape,\u201d Mr. Snyder explained with considerable distaste. \u201cNow there are enough ways you can do it within the yarn, twisting it a little bit tighter \u2014 almost like loading a spring.\u201dThe yarn woven to produce Mr. Snyder\u2019s newly introduced $795 single-breasted travel suit is so peppy, he claimed, you can wad it up into a ball.Rather than taking Mr. Snyder at his word, I stuffed the jacket into my gym bag and promptly forgot about it. Days later, I discovered it wedged between a pair of Stan Smiths and some gym shorts. I yanked it out, gave it a quick shake and some airing. Then I put it on and wore it to a business lunch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revised Economic Growth Figures Suggest a Revival That May Endure", "Date": "2014-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHoliday SurpriseIt\u2019s a grand thing when the tone that emerges from economic data fits the mood of the season in which it is released. So here, for the holidays, is the festive news: The economy roared ahead at a 5 percent annual growth rate in the July through September quarter, the fastest quarterly growth since 2003.That beats the 3.9 percent that the Commerce Department had earlier estimated for the third quarter. It follows a 4.6 percent growth rate in the second quarter, for the strongest six-month period for overall economic growth in more than a decade.And a separate report from the government on Tuesday morning pointed to the good times continuing in the latter part of the year. Personal income rose 0.4 percent in November, and consumption spending rose a whopping 0.6 percent.The biggest revision that boosted G.D.P. was in personal consumption spending, the biggest engine of overall economic activity, which rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate, not the 2.2 percent rate earlier estimated. That suggests that falling energy prices are leaving Americans in better position to spend on everything else.We might lose our economics reporter license, though, if we didn\u2019t mention some of the more negative caveats.First, the first quarter of 2014 featured an unusually steep economic contraction, a 2.1 percent annual rate of decline. The analysts who saw that as a strange blip and not reflective of the underlying strength of the economy now look correct, but when you factor that in, overall growth over the last year is nothing particularly exceptional.The economy grew 2.7 percent in inflation-adjusted terms over the year ended in September, which is fine, but not really a meaningful improvement over the earlier phases of the expansion. It actually was stronger than that just last year, recording a 3.1 percent growth rate for the full year 2013.So as great as it is to see strong expansion in the spring and summer, we\u2019re not experiencing an outright economic boom if you look at a slightly longer time horizon.Second, another piece of data released Tuesday offered less than happy tidings for the months ahead. Durable goods orders fell by a surprising 0.7 percent. Nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a key indicator of future investment spending by businesses, were flat.A boom in durable goods orders in the third quarter appears to have softened near the end of the year, suggesting that a business investment binge that helped support the blockbuster 5 percent growth rate over the summer got a bit ahead of itself and will be less of a boon for the overall economy in the near future.But we can worry about that in the new year. For now, the American economy is expanding the fastest it has in over a decade, job growth is picking up, and there are even some hints that higher wages might follow. After six years of an economic recovery that has been perpetually disappointing, that\u2019s a Christmas gift anyone can celebrate.An earlier version of this article misstated the Commerce Department\u2019s estimate for third-quarter G.D.P. growth before the recent revision. The growth rate was 3.9 percent, not 4.6 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save a Few Pennies on Champagne? Lawmakers in Britain\u2019s House of Lords Are Aghast", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 These are tough times in Britain. Half a million British children are going hungry, the government plans to cut public spending to a share of the economy not seen since the 1930s, and the honorable lords and ladies of the House of Lords have come under attack for their Champagne budget.But hardship breeds revolt, even, it appears, by the peers of the realm. The Champagne wars, as some here call them, broke out in recent weeks after news that the lords and ladies had rejected a proposal a few years ago to save the taxpayers some money by merging the catering department of their chamber, the unelected upper house of Parliament, with that of the House of Commons, the elected lower chamber. Apparently, \u201cthe lords feared that the quality of Champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service.\u201dThose words, from Malcolm Jack, a former clerk of the Commons who was interviewed by a committee of lawmakers this month, caused some astonishment.\u201cIs that true? Did you make that up?\u201d asked the chairman of the committee, Jack Straw, a former home secretary.\u201cYes, it is true,\u201d Mr. Jack replied.The House of Lords, which gets an annual catering subsidy of 1.3 million pounds, or $2 million, has spent $415,563 on about 17,000 bottles of Champagne since the Conservative-led government of Prime Minister David Cameron took office in 2010 and started cutting public spending. That is roughly five bottles for each of its 791 peers each year.Owen Williams, a spokesman for the House of Lords, disputed the idea that the proposal to merge the catering services had ever been discussed, calling Mr. Jack\u2019s testimony \u201cinaccurate.\u201d In an interview, Mr. Williams also pointed out that the bubbly was not given to peers for free, but sold at a profit in their private bars and at banquets.But at a time of widespread hunger and plans for deep budget cuts, that explanation did little to help the image of the lords and ladies. The British news media condemned \u201cpampered peers\u201d and \u201cChampagne Charlies,\u201d questioning the rationale not only for a Champagne budget but also for keeping a mostly appointed and still partly hereditary house \u2014 a legislative chamber that is now the world\u2019s biggest, outside China, because no one is ever forced to retire.News of the Champagne budget has also sharpened the focus on the widening gap between the privileged few and those less fortunate.While members of the House of Lords can claim \u00a3300 a day simply for showing up, the number of people receiving emergency food aid from the Trussel Trust \u2014 the country\u2019s largest food bank charity \u2014 on at least three days last year rose above 913,000, a nearly threefold increase from the previous year.The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who announced the report\u2019s release last week, described his shock at seeing people lining up outside food banks. Frank Field, a lawmaker from the Labour Party who helped to lead the inquiry that the report was based on, said half a million children lived in families that were unable to feed them, and in half of all British families, an adult skipped a meal each day. \u201cSomething disturbing is happening,\u201d he told reporters. Families, devastated by wage stagnation and delays in benefit payments, are often only \u201cone bill away\u201d from crisis.The report panel, which interviewed 155 witnesses and received 246 written submissions, said that its very existence would have been unthinkable 30 years ago, when the assumption was that \u201cnobody in Britain could be hungry unless they wished to be.\u201dAs economists and labor unions wondered whether the planned austerity measures would take Britain back to the precariousness of Victorian times or merely to something like the aftermath of the Great Depression, the Office for Budget Responsibility, a nonpartisan economic think tank, calculated that if Mr. Osborne followed through, government consumption of goods and services would fall to its lowest share of gross domestic product since 1938.One member of the House of Lords, Patrick Jenkin, decided to set an example this week by retiring at age 88. He is urging his fellow octogenarians to do the same. \u201cI see some of these extinct volcanoes sitting on the back bench of the Labour Party and they are just waiting for some money,\u201d he told The Daily Telegraph. \u201cIt is a great shame. It can\u2019t go on.\u201dMeanwhile, Anne Jenkin, a Conservative member of the House of Lords who is the daughter-in-law of Mr. Jenkin, offered her own explanation for the country\u2019s increasing hunger: \u201cPoor people do not know how to cook.\u201dHer bowl of porridge in the morning, Ms. Jenkin said, costs 4 pence, far less than the \u201csugary cereal\u201d poor people eat.It turns out that Ms. Jenkin is a member of the Lords\u2019 Refreshment Committee, which is in charge of Champagne procurement. She later apologized for any offense her comments might have caused, but the damage was done. Ms. Jenkin\u2019s words quickly made headlines.\u201cLet them eat porridge!\u201d the newspapers said.Advertisement"}

But concessions demanded by coal-dependent Poland significantly weakened the deal. \u201cAt some point, it doesn\u2019t matter what the politics say, we\u2019re going to walk into tipping points,\u201d where climate changes spin out of control, \u201cand that\u2019s the problem,\u201d she said.Jonathan Grant, climate change director at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London, agreed that Europe\u2019s commitment was ambitious, compared with those of other regions. But he said that while Europe had reduced its carbon intensity, a measure of how much carbon dioxide is emitted per unit of economic activity, by 2.5 percent in 2013, annual drops of 6 percent will be needed if the world is to have a chance at keeping warming to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, considered the point at which catastrophic changes kick in.\u201cYou basically need to see a revolution in all sectors of the economy to achieve and sustain that carbon intensity reduction,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernments are still falling far short of what\u2019s really required to achieve the 2 degree goal, including Europe. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s recognition of the scale of change that\u2019s required.\u201dEurope appears on track to meet its current goal of cutting emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020. The 2030 agreement was reached after months of wrangling between coal-dependent eastern nations and others, like Germany and Sweden, who wanted a tougher plan.As it is, the 40 percent target may not be firm. Under pressure from businesses and governments worried about global competitiveness, leaders agreed to reconsider their goal if other nations failed to make strong promises at the December 2015 United Nations climate meeting in Paris.\u201cThere\u2019s a deliberate ambiguity\u201d about what Europe would do in those circumstances, said David Reiner, assistant director of the University of Cambridge\u2019s Energy Policy Research Group. \u201cThey\u2019re quite vague about it, and it\u2019s not entirely clear that if China and the U.S. and everybody else signs up in 2015, does that mean the E.U. might sign up to more than 40 percent? You could read it that way.\u201d\u201cYou could also read it that if we are the only ones, it\u2019s not entirely clear we will set a tough, binding 40 percent target,\u201d he added. \u201cThat to me is one of the big question marks.\u201dOthers welcomed the possible way out. Alexandre Affre, director for industrial affairs at BusinessEurope, a powerful business alliance, said companies worried that they would take a hit if Europe moved alone. \u201cIf Europe remains the only one going so far, so quick,\u201d he said, \u201cfor us it brings a real question of global level playing field for European industry. Which is why we keep saying this deal makes sense only if there is a meaningful global climate agreement.\u201d He added: \u201cIf not, we think Europe should think again about this 40 percent and possibly revise down.\u201dMr. Grant, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that European Union leaders took the economic concerns seriously, and that the 2030 framework was unlikely to have a major effect on competitiveness. Despite its shortcomings, the deal was a real achievement, Ms. Whiteman said. \u201cTry to get 28 people agreeing on where to go for dinner \u2014 that\u2019s just not easy,\u201d she said.It was doable in part because climate is a far less polarizing issue in Europe than in America, said Scott Barrett, natural resource economics professor at Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute.\u201cIn terms of the understanding of the problem, the need to act, the faith in multi-lateralism, all of that is much stronger in Europe than the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is that Europe alone cannot address the issue.\u201dHopes of a strong international deal got a lift last month, when President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China announced a landmark emissions agreement. The U.S. promised to emit 26 percent to 28 percent less carbon dioxide in 2025 than in 2005, and China said its emissions would peak by 2030. The American carbon-cutting numbers use a different baseline year than Europe\u2019s, so are not directly comparable.Under Europe\u2019s agreement, only the overall target, and not the goals of getting 27 percent of energy from renewable sources or improving efficiency by 27 percent, will be applied to nations individually. That is a shift from its 2020 framework, under which each nation was assigned its own goals in all three areas.The efficiency target, derided by environmentalists as business as usual, is not binding. The renewable energy target is binding for the continent as a whole, but experts say it is unclear how it will be enforced.\u201cEvery country can do what they want to do, some can be more ambitious than others, some won\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Brigitte Knopf, head of energy strategies research at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in Germany.Ms. Knopf said she feared \u201cthat we will have within Europe two different speeds of transformation,\u201d with eastern countries shouldering much smaller emissions cuts than those in the West.Others see the deal\u2019s structure as a strength, arguing that it makes sense to let each country decide how to achieve its own emissions cuts under a simpler regulatory structure.Most agree that Europe\u2019s carbon-trading market, the Emissions Trading System, will be an essential tool, particularly in the absence of hard renewable targets that drive investment in solar, wind and other clean power sources. In its current form, the trading system is not up to that job, mainly because a glut of pollution permits has kept their price too low to make an impact.\u201cYou really will need an effective and potentially quite significant carbon price\u201d to reach the 40 percent goal, Mr. Reiner said. Europe, he said, may not realize the difficulty of the task.\u201cThere isn\u2019t even an appreciation of just how challenging a 40 percent reduction target is, because 20 percent was so easy,\u201d with emissions falling since 1990 because of factors including a shift from coal to natural gas in some nations and years of recession. This time, he said, \u201cit\u2019s really going to have to be driven by climate policies, and that is a very different world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Abe, speaking at a late-night news conference, laid out his vision for a term that could last as long as four more years, which would be enough to make him one of the longest-serving prime ministers since World War II.\u201cI will give my all to advance the biggest reforms since the end of the war,\u201d Mr. Abe told reporters. \u201cThis is a challenge that we must take.\u201dAdmitting that he still faces a battle to revise the Constitution, Mr. Abe said he must first build popular support for any changes. While the current Constitution was written after the war by American occupation forces, it has never been revised.However, there are growing feelings that constitutional limits on its armed forces no longer make sense for a nation that faces the challenge of a rising China, and what is perceived to be the relative decline of its postwar protector, the United States. Many right-wing politicians, including Mr. Abe, have long called for replacing the Constitution with a domestically written one to restore the defeated nation\u2019s wounded pride.The landslide election victory on Dec. 14 by Mr. Abe\u2019s governing Liberal Democratic Party has put it close to the two-thirds majority needed under Japanese law to pass changes in the Constitution. However, those changes must also be approved by a majority of voters, which Mr. Abe admitted remained a high hurdle.Mr. Abe said he would \u201cwork hard to increase the people\u2019s understanding\u201d of the need for constitutional changes, while also coming up with specific proposals for which parts to change.These would probably include Article 9, which renounces the right to both wage war and to maintain \u201cwar potential.\u201d For decades, Japan has interpreted this as allowing a purely defensive military with strict limits on what it can do. Such a change would probably face intense resistance from the Japanese people, many of whom still reject anything hinting at Japan\u2019s failed wartime militarism. It may also further alienate its neighbors China and South Korea, where memories of Imperial Japan\u2019s brutal early 20th-century march across Asia remain raw.\u201cNext, changing the Constitution. Well, I think I can say this will be a historic challenge,\u201d Mr. Abe said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be so easy.\u201dMr. Abe spoke after Parliament\u2019s lower house re-elected him on Wednesday as prime minister, in a victory that was never in doubt, given his party\u2019s dominance of the chamber. Mr. Abe then reappointed all but one member of his cabinet, removing only his scandal-tainted defense minister, Akinori Eto.Mr. Abe appointed Gen Nakatani, a former army officer who supports expanding the role of Japan\u2019s military, the Self-Defense Forces, as his new defense minister.\u201cJapan\u2019s security environment has changed,\u201d Mr. Nakatani told reporters, \u201cand we must fortify our national security.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The ruble fell 11 percent against the dollar on Monday alone.To try to stanch the bleeding, on Monday evening (the middle of the night Moscow time), the Central Bank of Russia announced a stunning interest rate increase. Its main deposit rate is now 17 percent, up from 10.5 percent when Russian banks closed for business Monday.It may go without saying, but an emergency interest rate increase of 6.5 percentage points announced in the middle of the night is not a sign of strength. Rather, it is the kind of thing you see only in an old-school emerging markets currency crisis. And that is very much what Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia is now experiencing.The strategy is straightforward enough. The central bank, led by Elvira Nabiullina, is hoping that with interest rates so high, keeping money on deposit at a Russian bank is too good an offer to refuse. Russians (and Russian companies) have been shuttling rubles out of the country as fast as they can, looking for a safe port. The continued slide of the ruble is all the more remarkable given economic sanctions imposed in retaliation for Russian aggression toward Ukraine that make Russian money unwelcome at many global banks.Perhaps the higher interest rates will make those moving money out of Russia think twice, and a resulting reversal in currency markets will lead speculators to conclude that betting against the ruble is no longer a sure thing.But the move shows how Russian policy makers are stuck with no good options. Already the central bank has reportedly been intervening to try to short-circuit the sell-off, buying rubles to try to arrest the declines.The hope is that by stabilizing the value of the currency, the interest rate increase will reduce the sense of financial panic and rapid outflows of money, which will do more good for the Russian economy than the higher interest rates will do ill.But as Russia\u2019s citizens are going to face an unpleasant combination of a contracting economy (caused by falling oil prices and higher interest rates) and high inflation (because the collapse in the ruble will make imported goods more expensive), one thing is certain: It will be a long, cold winter.Advertisement"}

Taylor III, responded to requests for comments. But in a statement after the indictment, Mr. Taylor defended Mr. Blankenship: \u201cHis outspoken criticism of powerful bureaucrats has earned this indictment. He will not yield to their effort to silence him.\u201dMany family members of Upper Big Branch victims feared, in the nearly five years since the explosion, that Mr. Blankenship would never be held accountable because of his power and money.But all along, prosecutors were pressuring top executives to cooperate and establishing a paper trail tying Mr. Blankenship to daily decisions at Upper Big Branch. It is meant to refute any claim that he was too senior to have been involved in the disaster, which a state investigation traced to a corporate \u201cculture in which wrongdoing became acceptable, where deviation was the norm.\u201dMr. Blankenship overrode managers who sought to strengthen roofs to prevent cave-ins or install ventilation systems to prevent explosions, ordering them to ignore \u201cconstruction jobs\u201d and instead to \u201crun coal.\u201dWhen Upper Big Branch did not make its quotas or cut costs deeply enough, Mr. Blankenship threatened the mine president. \u201cYou have a kid to feed. Do your job,\u201d he wrote. In another note scolding the executive for not producing enough coal, he wrote: \u201cI could Khrushchev you. Do you understand?\u201dEarly in his career, Mr. Blankenship became famous for breaking the grip of unions at Massey mines. Investigations described a climate of intimidation at Upper Big Branch in which miners were afraid to report unsafe practices, and two sets of books were kept to conceal hazards from inspectors.The report also traced the disaster to the failure of West Virginia politicians, Democrats and Republicans, to stand up to companies like Massey, which \u201cused the leverage of the jobs it provided to attempt to control West Virginia\u2019s political system.\u201dA prime example was the $3 million that Mr. Blankenship contributed to defeat a justice on the state\u2019s Supreme Court in 2004, replacing him with one sympathetic to Massey at a time when the company was appealing a $50 million judgment against it.Two years before the Upper Big Branch explosion, federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against Mr. Blankenship in an accident with similar circumstances at a mine in Logan County, over the objections of the widows of two men killed.The case was taken as a lesson by the incoming United States attorney, Mr. Goodwin, who took over just after the Upper Big Branch disaster, according to a federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because a judge had ordered all parties to the case, including relatives of the miners, not to talk about it publicly.Mr. Blankenship argues that the deadly explosion, on April 5, 2010, was caused by a natural \u201cinundation\u201d of methane gas. State investigators found no evidence for this theory.On Nov. 21, he pleaded not guilty in federal court in Beckley, W.Va. A trial date was set for Jan. 26. Mr. Blankenship, who retired from Massey shortly before it was acquired in 2011 by Alpha Natural Resources, was ordered to remain in southern West Virginia or eastern Kentucky.Although Mr. Blankenship now lives in Las Vegas, his primary residence was once in Mingo County, where he grew up and built a mansion with a helipad in one of West Virginia\u2019s poorest communities. He piped in clean drinking water to his home even as neighbors sued Massey for poisoning the local wells.Bruce Stanley, a lawyer who grew up in Mingo County and has squared off against Massey in court, said there was a flaw in Mr. Blankenship\u2019s creed of economic survival of the fittest. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy who did indeed pull himself up by his bootstraps,\u201d he said. \u201cYou ask yourself, at what expense? Don\u2019s the very guy who put his neighbors out of work, who\u2019s driven his local community into the bottom of the bottom of the livability standards of the Western Hemisphere.\u201dIn Whitesville, Jerry Mollohan, 64, a retired miner, called the indictment \u201clong overdue.\u201d He said that after a former security director from the mine, Hughie Elbert Stover, was sentenced to jail last year, he feared that would be as far as prosecutors reached. Mr. Blankenship was \u201cmore like a dictator than a manager,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope his political power won\u2019t get him off.\u201dPeople in town sometimes refer to the explosion as \u201cthe incident,\u201d and avoid mentioning the former Massey boss.

He even defied his house arrest to attend the demonstrations himself, which led swiftly to his detention and a return to his home. Even before the verdict was announced, more than 10,000 Russians had indicated on Facebook that they would attend a protest in support of Mr. Navalny. The actual turnout was much more modest. Still, thousands of Russians took to the streets despite the threat of arrests, the bitter cold and the approaching New Year holiday. Mr. Navalny, a 21st-century Russian dissident, presents a new kind of threat to the Putin regime. He was the first Russian activist to have used the Internet as an effective tool of political resistance. In the past, he and his followers have demonstrated that Russia\u2019s opposition activists are not simply \u201cvirtual,\u201d but are also capable of getting people onto the streets. This is a relatively recent phenomenon. For a long time, the Internet didn\u2019t matter in Russia, at least as a weapon of the opposition. When I lived in Moscow in 2010, the Russian Internet was a generally free space, largely because the Kremlin didn\u2019t take it seriously. It seemed to view the web as a virtual playground where people could complain and joke about politics, but where there was no threat of real-life action. The Internet just reflected offline realities. Most Russians didn\u2019t think they had any impact on their political situation. Elections were viewed as predetermined. Opposition protests were sparsely attended, and often ended with protesters\u2019 being rounded up by the police. The Internet, simply by existing, was not going to change this overall picture. Enter Mr. Navalny, who understood that his countrymen were tired of pointless street demonstrations. He decided to show Russians that they could make a difference, from the comfort of their homes. \u201cI propose to people the comfortable way of struggle,\u201d Mr. Navalny explained to me in 2010. He didn\u2019t ask people to revolt, he just called on them to file online complaints. He provided detailed instructions for appealing to the authorities, and asked his supporters to report everything from unrepaired potholes to suspicious government contracts. Success is a powerful antidote to apathy. Years of these campaigns showed individual Russians that together, they could get things done. Given this bleak atmosphere, it is notable that anyone attended the protest on Tuesday. Authorities predictably responded with a heavy police presence, and a number of arrests were reported. The opposition faces a tough battle. Mr. Navalny has proved that the Internet\u2019s power is not just \u201cvirtual.\u201d But it does have its limits. The opposition\u2019s main obstacle will continue to be public apathy, which is an authoritarian government\u2019s best protection. The Internet alone is not enough to overcome it. But something else could: the flailing Russian economy. An economic crisis caused by declining oil revenue, Western sanctions and a plummeting ruble could make Mr. Putin more vulnerable and eventually spark a mass uprising. And thanks to the Internet, Mr. Navalny and his supporters will have the tools to take advantage of a revolutionary situation if it does arise.For now, Mr. Navalny has been trying to convince his followers that inaction is not an option. \u201cThere is no one but you,\u201d he once wrote on his blog. \u201cIf you are reading this, you are the resistance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For every 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, there were 62.5 births in 2013, compared with 63 the previous year.The decline is especially notable because the number of women in their prime childbearing years, 20 to 39, has been growing since 2007.Some demographers said the numbers were not cause for concern.\u201cAmericans haven\u2019t worried much about birthrates in the past, because we have the faucet of immigration to turn on and off,\u201d said Andrew J. Cherlin, a family demographer at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger problem in Europe, where countries like Germany and Spain have much lower rates. And even at 1.8, we\u2019re in the ballpark with the highest rates in Europe.\u201dWilliam H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington, also related the fertility rates to the economy.\u201cOn just about every demographic indicator involving young adults, whether it\u2019s marriage, buying a home or delaying childbearing, it\u2019s all been on hold since the beginning of the recession,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll come back up, and each time new numbers are coming out, I think maybe this will be the moment.\u201dSo while the teenage birthrate has dropped substantially, and the birthrate for women in their 20s has been declining as well, births to older women are on the rise. Although women older than 44 are not counted in the nation\u2019s general fertility rate \u2014 fewer than one in a thousand such women have a baby each year \u2014 the report found a 14 percent increase in births to women ages 45-49.Twin births are increasingly common, now representing about one in every 30 babies born in the United States. And preterm births and cesarean-section deliveries are declining, the report found. White women, who once had the highest rates of cesarean deliveries, now have the lowest rate, and the largest decline, while black women have the highest.

But she added that an all-out ban goes too far. \u201cWe don\u2019t oblige anybody to take part in the contests,\u201d she said.Ms. Cerri said that in recent years the Miss World Argentina competition had tried to place greater emphasis on factors apart from physical appearance. A winner must perform well in categories such as social responsibility, for which she might be required to show awareness of social issues like sex trafficking in her home province. Contestants must also demonstrate knowledge of general culture, including current events, and exhibit a talent, which can be a skill like acting or painting.Ms. Cerri said that the judges in some smaller pageants were sometimes exclusively men \u2014 local officials \u201cwho only value a catwalk in a bikini.\u201d\u201cSo, in that sense, I think it\u2019s perfect to regulate them,\u201d she added.\u201cBeauty is not something that can be objectified,\u201d said the text of the measure approved by Chivilcoy\u2019s City Council. \u201cOrganizing a competitive scenario of this kind creates a discriminatory and violent situation.\u201dThe authorities in Chivilcoy said they planned to replace the traditional pageants with a community service prize for volunteers from ages 15 to 30, who would be recognized for their work in improving the quality of life in the city, where the economy is largely based on farming and cattle ranching.Criticism of beauty pageants has also\u00a0been increasing elsewhere in Argentina.

{"Headline": "Oil Prices Fall Again, and Stocks Follow Suit", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe swoon in oil prices led to a steep decline in equities, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closing lower by 1.6 percent, to 2,002.33, as investors feared that the declining energy demand meant that the global economy was slowing.\u201cPeople are scared that the drop in oil demand is the first leg down for the global economy that had been led by the growth in the emerging markets,\u201d said Nancy T. Schmitt, president of Taum Sauk Investments. \u201cThat growth has evaporated. The demand has gone away, and we are seeing it first with oil prices.\u201dThe global benchmark for crude approached $60 a barrel \u2014 down more than 3 percent on the day and roughly 45 percent since the summer. And the American benchmark continued its free fall as well, to below $58 a barrel, down around 4 percent. A day earlier, it sagged below $60 a barrel in the United States for the first time since 2009.The new rout began Friday morning after the International Energy Agency, the organization based in Paris that advises industrial countries, cut its forecast for global demand for crude oil in 2015 by 230,000 barrels a day. The agency cited less oil consumption in countries that produce it like Russia and a weaker-than-expected global economy.A trim of 230,000 barrels a day is minimal in a global market of about 93 million barrels a day. But the lower forecast, the fourth by the agency in the last five months, reinforced the sentiment that supply will most likely exceed demand substantially next year.The Energy Department also issued a report later in the day predicting that American oil production would average 9.3 million barrels a day in 2015, 700,000 barrels more than this year. That is a small downward revision of production previously predicted by the department, but its report emphasized that \u201call the decrease in forecast production growth comes in the second half of 2015.\u201dThe department said that drilling activity in North Dakota, a main driver of the surging domestic oil production of recent years, has \u201cnot slowed, despite the significant decline in domestic crude oil prices since July 2014,\u201d according to the most recent data released by North Dakota regulators.The result was a near capitulation in the market for oil.\u201cIn the very short term prices can go lower; the market is weighted to very bearish sentiment,\u201d said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London.But even with the recent plunge, oil prices still have not approached the lows of recent decades. For example, oil briefly broke below $10 a barrel in 1986, which equates to about $21 today after adjusting for inflation.At least in the short term, the declines are good news for American drivers about to take vacations or visit their families and friends for the holidays.\u201cGas prices will continue to be in a free fall as long as crude oil is searching for a bottom,\u201d the AAA motor club reported on Friday.Nationally, the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline fell 2 cents on Friday to $2.60, 11 cents below its price a week ago, according to AAA. Drivers on average are paying $1.10 a gallon less than they paid on April 28, the high point for the year in gas prices.\u201cMany drivers are spending $15 to $30 less per trip to the gas station compared to what they paid during this year\u2019s highs,\u201d the motor club said.New York is the only state in the continental United States with an average above $3 a gallon, the motor club said, but at $3.02, \u201cthe average should drop below that mark within a few days.\u201dA test of strength appears to be occurring among the Saudis and their equally prosperous Gulf allies, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and other producers like Venezuela and Iran, which can much less easily afford a long bout of low prices. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the U.A.E. have about $1.5 trillion in financial assets among them, which is \u201cplenty to meet their spending needs for the next few years,\u201d said Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in London.At the same time, Venezuela, Nigeria and other producers are \u201cgoing to have to cut back on spending,\u201d Ms. Ziemba said. Already, Venezuelan officials have said it may be necessary to call an emergency OPEC meeting if the price rout continues.The Saudis and their allies argue that to cut production now to raise prices would be to subsidize competitors like the companies extracting oil from shale in the United States, which are responsible for recent big additions to world oil supplies.David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Norway\u2019s Pension Fund Is Advised to Keep Fossil Fuel Shares", "Date": "2014-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreen ColumnLONDON \u2014 If the decision had been different, it might have made a dramatic headline: \u201cNorway to sell out of oil companies.\u201d Instead, a panel of experts advising Norway\u2019s Finance Ministry recommended last week that the giant sovereign wealth fund that invests the country\u2019s petroleum wealth remain an active investor in oil and coal companies.The six-person group was set up by the government this year in response to pressure from opposition parties for the fund to divest its holdings in companies that extract coal. Of all the fossil fuels, coal produces the highest emissions of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Environmental groups have been urging curbs on coal and tar sands as initial steps to a broad exit from all fossil fuels.A recommendation from the panel that the fund get rid of its fossil fuel shares would have added momentum to global efforts, led by groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council in the United States, to persuade university endowments and other organizations to sell these stocks.\u201cWe were quite disappointed at the conclusion from the panel,\u201d said Lars Haltbrekken, chairman of the Norway branch of Friends of the Earth, an environmental advocacy group. \u201cWe think that if Norway and the pension fund withdrew from the fossil fuel industry or the coal industry, it will be a very strong signal to the market.\u201dThe panel, consisting mostly of academics, took a more cautious approach, arguing that fossil fuels were likely to be an important part of the global economy for decades. The fund could accomplish more, the panel said, by demanding greener practices at oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell and Total \u2014 both among its top 10 equity holdings as of the end of September \u2014 than by jettisoning them from its portfolio.The fund, called the Government Pension Fund Global, says that on average, it owns about 1.3 percent of all listed companies globally and about 2.5 percent of those on European exchanges.\u201cFor a fund as large as Norway\u2019s, it is inappropriate to exit from fossil-fuel stocks,\u201d Elroy Dimson, a panel member and an emeritus professor of finance at the London Business School, wrote in an email. \u201cWith Norway\u2019s muscle, there is more to be gained by engaging with companies, regulators and governments.\u201dThe panel\u2019s skepticism may be a sign that persuading investors to sell out of fossil fuel companies faces greater complexity than similar efforts like promoting divestment from cigarette makers. Consuming tobacco \u201cby and large has only harmful consequences,\u201d the panel wrote, but even the burning of coal \u201cprovides economic and social benefits.\u201dThe panel also said that climate change was a complex issue, with no easily identifiable culprit that the fund can ban, unlike some activities like nuclear weapons production.When it comes to assigning blame for climate change, \u201cthe villain is our present society,\u201d the panel wrote. \u201cTaking part in the global economic system also means contributing to climate change.\u201dThe divestment movement has made high-profile converts of late, including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a philanthropic group of the Rockefeller family, which said in September that it would sharply reduce its investments in coal and tar sands and also work to cut other exposure to fossil fuels over the next few years.Like the Rockefeller family, the Norwegian fund\u2019s wealth is based on oil. The fund receives a portion of Norway\u2019s petroleum revenues each year, which it invests with the goal of building up a fortune for future generations after the oil runs out.Over the years, it has amassed what is considered the largest sovereign wealth fund, with about $860 billion under management, ranking ahead of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Saudi Arabia\u2019s central bank, according to estimates published by the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, a research organization.The debate over divesting fossil fuels in Norway is likely to continue. Mr. Haltbrekken of Friends of the Earth said that the opposition parties were likely to eventually force a parliamentary vote on coal, adding to the pressure on the minority center-right government.Christine Meisingset, head of sustainability at Storebrand, a large Norwegian asset manager, said that there was also a strong argument for the fund to diversify its portfolio by moving away from fossil fuel shares. With so much of Norway\u2019s cash coming from fossil fuels, the logic goes, there is little reason for it to use that money to invest in oil companies.The fund is managed by a wing of the central bank and strives to be a hard-nosed, professional investor. But as an enormously wealthy institution in a country of only about five million people, it also comes under pressure to achieve ethical and political goals.To accommodate these pressures, the government has set up a council on ethics that can recommend bans on investments in companies falling under several criteria, including violating human rights and producing tobacco.Over the years, the Finance Ministry has barred investments in a substantial list of companies, like Lockheed Martin, for its involvement with nuclear weapons, and Walmart Stores, for \u201cthe risk of complicity\u201d in human rights violations like child labor.The expert committee recommended that a new category called \u201ccontribution to climate change\u201d be added to the list of criteria for banned investments. In the past, some mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Barrick Gold, have been banned because they were believed to have caused environmental damage. But identifying companies for disinvestment is a slow process.It is not going to be easy to purge Norway\u2019s fund of fossil fuels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Liberal Zionists Count On Hillary Clinton?", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDaniel Zemel first visited Israel fresh off his bar mitzvah, in 1966. A bookish Jewish kid from Chicago, Zemel had a love for Israel inherited from his grandfather, Rabbi Solomon Goldman, a friend of Albert Einstein\u2019s who was president from 1938 to 1940 of the then left-leaning Zionist Organization of America. With the other members of his Jewish education group, the 13-year-old Zemel spent two weeks in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa. He lunched in cafeterias with the kibbutzniks he idolized, ate frozen treats on the beach and climbed a lookout tower, peering into Jerusalem\u2019s still forbidden Old City. A year later, Zemel was ecstatic when Israeli forces captured everything he had surveyed and beyond, including the Temple Mount, the West Bank and Gaza, in the Six-Day War with Egypt, Syria and Jordan. Over the decades, as Israel matured and began to wrestle with the occupation, Zemel did, too. He visited Israel again and again, as a college student, a rabbinical student and an assistant rabbi in Minnesota.In 1983, Zemel became the head rabbi of Temple Micah, in the Northwest section of Washington. In the constellation of liberal American synagogues, there are a handful that stand out for their political engagement and the influence of their members \u2014 Leo Baeck Temple in Los Angeles, Congregation Beth Elohim in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and KAM Isaiah Israel on Barack Obama\u2019s old block in Chicago. But none have more connections to Capitol Hill.In the fall, Zemel, a contemplative 62-year-old with horn-rimmed glasses, a bushy mustache and a bald dome from which his skullcap incessantly slips, stood before his congregation in a state of unrest. It was the start of the Jewish New Year, and he had decided to express his anguish over Israel in the form of a sermon about the direction his beloved country had taken. All summer, during the war in Gaza, Zemel and many of the members of his progressive congregation had been racked with worry. In his book-lined office, decorated with an Israeli flag and a poster of Yoda holding a Hebrew bible, emails from congregants had been regularly popping up on Zemel\u2019s computer screen, railing about Israelis \u201ckilling children.\u201d Zemel sat with congregants as they wept on his couch.The entire year 5774, in fact, was a trying one for Zemel and other liberal Zionists, who increasingly find themselves torn between their liberalism and Zionism and stranded in the disappearing middle between the extremes of a polarized American Jewish community. Micah\u2019s liberal Zionists remained wedded to a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians and estranged from the policies of a right-wing Israeli government, along with the reflexive Israel-can-do-no-wrong sentiment on Capitol Hill. But they also felt alienated by Jewish groups to their left, some of which chanted, \u201cStop the murder, stop the hate, Israel is a racist state.\u201dZemel, fighting a nagging cold, looked out at the robust crowd on Rosh Hashana. He knew that the people gathered before him \u2014 and the people they knew \u2014 could help determine United States policy toward Israel. Some of them even had a direct line to Hillary Clinton, the early favorite to be the Democrats\u2019 nominee for president in 2016. Sara Ehrman, who is 95 and a veteran of Jewish-American politics, was a mentor to Clinton; she sat next to Maria Echaveste, a former official in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration and a convert to Judaism whom President Obama nominated to become ambassador to Mexico. Al From, an architect of the Democratic resurgence of the 1990s and adviser to Bill Clinton, sat across the aisle. Arrayed around them sat newspaper, magazine and television journalists in a congregation that included David Gregory, a former host of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d; Jake Tapper, a CNN anchor; and Dana Bash, a Washington correspondent for CNN and the former wife of Jeremy Bash, who was a national-security official in the Obama administration. Another member of the congregation is Alan Cooperman, director of religion research at the Pew Research Center, which a year before published a landmark portrait of Jewish Americans that showed, among other things, that less than a third of young Jews said \u201ccaring about Israel\u201d was essential to their Jewish identity.Zemel adjusted his skullcap. \u201cTonight we celebrate the creation of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in this season we also take a look at ourselves: We acknowledge our past, our errors, who we are. What better time to look in the same way at the only Jewish country in the world? The events of this summer actually only strengthened my decision to speak about Israel and American Jewry\u2019s ongoing and evolving relationship with that mystifying, infuriating yet enchanting place.\u201dAs the sermon progressed, Zemel became more impassioned. He recounted the story of the reprisal murder in July of a Palestinian teenager from East Jerusalem by Israeli extremists. \u201cI am so ashamed,\u201d he shouted. He bemoaned the growing ultranationalism in Israel by saying it had \u201cdragged through the mud\u201d what he called \u201cthe greatest ethical tradition in history.\u201d Heads nodded in the pews. \u201cIn many segments of American Jewry,\u201d Zemel said, \u201cone is free to disagree with the president of the United States, but the prime minister of Israel is sacrosanct. How patently absurd!\u201d Zemel\u2019s criticism of the current Israeli government pivoted to a discussion of how the Holocaust and that summer\u2019s flare-ups of anti-Semitism in Europe reminded them all that Israel was existentially necessary. \u201cWe must love Israel even harder,\u201d he concluded, quoting from the Israeli national anthem. \u201cOd lo avda tikvateinu. We have not yet lost our hope.\u201dAsked about her tough talk, liberal Zionists tend to blame the requirements of American presidential-campaign politics. A vast majority of Jews care far more about social issues and the economy than they do about the issue of Israel and will always vote for the Democratic candidate. \u201cDemocrats who are Jewish will turn out in droves in support of her,\u201d Haim Saban, a media mogul and major Clinton-campaign financier told me. And the Jewish donors? \u201cWithout a doubt.\u201dBut Clinton knows that there is a wealthy and influential sliver of more-moderate Democratic Jews for whom Israel is a priority. They are less conservative than the G.O.P.'s top Jewish donors, like Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino owner, but feel protective enough of Israel that they could plausibly support a Republican if they sensed anything less than complete support from a Democrat. The political arithmetic for Clinton is easy \u2014 knowing you can take the larger liberal Jewish vote for granted, you support Israel\u2019s right-wing government to keep moderates from bolting.The political quandary for liberal Zionists is that, as part of the Jewish majority that will vote for Clinton regardless, they aren\u2019t in a great position to make demands and are reduced to hoping that Clinton secretly agonizes over the issue as much as they do. Saban, the major Clinton-campaign financier, told me that Clinton was pained by the consequences of Israel\u2019s actions, just not publicly. \u201cI can tell you that privately she has expressed empathy for the Palestinians,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe has.\u201d Victor Kovner, a Democratic bundler who has a Chuck Close painting of Hillary Clinton hanging in his New York office, assures fellow liberal Jews that Clinton is on their side. \u201cShe is running for president, this isn\u2019t true-self time,\u201d he said. He suggested that Bill Clinton had demonstrated a much more nuanced view.But other Clinton supporters have no patience for hand-wringing liberal Zionists, especially because there is little daylight between them and Clinton on actual policy. \u201cWhat do they want her to do?\u201d said Ann Lewis, a senior adviser on Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign who is involved with Jewish issues.The standard line for Hillary Clinton, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is that she has been a consistent voice for Israel and for peace over the last quarter-century. But other Clinton intimates, including those in Temple Micah, say they have watched her position shift by degrees over the decades. Ehrman, for one, recalled an early iteration of Hillary Clinton as a promising liberal voice on Israel. Ehrman first met Clinton during George McGovern\u2019s 1972 presidential campaign in Texas. Back in Washington, Ehrman hosted Clinton, who had landed a job on the Watergate committee, in her apartment for a year, and the two became close. Ehrman later drove Clinton to Fayetteville, Ark., telling her all the way that she was making a mistake by giving up a promising career to marry the \u201ccountry lawyer\u201d Bill Clinton.In the early 1980s, Ehrman became political-education director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee \u2014 or Aipac \u2014 the country\u2019s most potent pro-Israel lobbying group. When the Clintons came to Washington as president and first lady, Ehrman became deputy political director of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cI did all the Jewish stuff around the White House,\u201d Ehrman said. That work culminated in organizing the Oslo Accords ceremony, at which Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands with the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat on the south lawn of the White House, sealing an agreement between Jews and Palestinians to end their conflict. On the morning of the signing ceremony, Hillary Clinton called Ehrman with a special reward. \u201c\u2009'I want you to stand at the front door of the diplomatic entrance, the main entrance, and I want you to see them coming in,'\u2009\u201d Ehrman recalled her saying.The event was a high point of liberal Zionism\u2019s harmony with Washington politics. \u201cIt was totally, totally amazing,\u201d said Zemel, who also attended the event. Clinton\u2019s interest in the issue did not end there. In May 1998, speaking via satellite to young Arabs and Israelis gathered in Switzerland for a conference, she became one of the first people associated with the Clinton administration to call for a two-state solution. \u201cI think that it will be in the long-term interest of the Middle East for Palestine to be a state,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthe territory that the Palestinians currently inhabit, and whatever additional territory they will obtain through the peace negotiations,\u201d should be considered \u201ca functioning modern state.\u201dThe White House, seemingly uncomfortable with her statement, clarified that she was expressing a personal view. Her willingness to embrace the Palestinians soon caused another problem. In 1999, Ehrman accompanied Hillary Clinton on a trip to Ramallah, during which Clinton listened to Suha Arafat, the wife of the Palestinian Authority leader Yasir Arafat, deliver a speech in Arabic accusing the Israeli government of gassing Palestinian women and children. At the conclusion of the remarks, Clinton embraced Suha Arafat and offered a customary peck on the cheek. The moment news of the kiss hit the wires, a high-ranking Clinton administration official placed an angry call to the cellphone of Rob Malley, a Middle East adviser to the president, who was traveling with the first lady, demanding that he fix the problem. But the damage to Hillary Clinton was done.The next day, some New York Jewish leaders seized on the incident to discredit Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy for the United States Senate, which was unofficially well underway. The New York Post ran a front-page headline reading \u201cShame on Hillary.\u201d It was around this time that she enrolled in political Hebrew School. Under the tutelage of the senior New York senator, Chuck Schumer, she became extremely adept at winning the trust of audiences who held an absolute pro-Israel position. Schumer did, however, need to assure attendees at one campaign fund-raiser that \u201cshe will look to me to see how to vote\u201d on Jewish issues.Clinton was elected to the Senate in 2000 and struck a tone that was in sync with the Bush administration, which had aligned itself with the Israeli right. In 2007, she went further than the administration when she released a position paper calling for \u201can undivided Jerusalem\u201d as the capital of Israel. In 2008, as a presidential candidate, she warned Tehran that America would \u201ctotally obliterate\u201d Iran if it attacked Israel.Many liberal Jews, alienated by Aipac over the years, were encouraged when Barack Obama ran against Clinton in the 2008 presidential primary. They appreciated that he took a more nuanced position when it came to supporting Israel, one that better reflected the political debate within Israel and among American Jews. They saw him as the rare presidential candidate who spoke their language and who seemed willing to push Israel toward peace. They expressed relief when he said that you could be committed to Israel while criticizing the policies of the right-wing government. \u201cI think there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel that you\u2019re opposed to Israel, that you\u2019re anti-Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that can\u2019t be the measure of our friendship with Israel.\u201dOnce elected, Obama seemed to understand that he needed someone to lend him credibility with the Israeli government and its American defenders, a tough friend of Israel who could muscle the country away from settlements and toward a peace agreement. An aide to Obama called Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish American Organizations, and asked him to call Hillary Clinton to see if she would be \u201cagreeable\u201d to being named secretary of state.Early in her tenure as secretary, she was harshly critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the country\u2019s increasingly conservative culture, surprising and appalling Aipac and many of her supporters in New York. She excoriated Israel\u2019s settlement growth and the \u201cantidemocratic\u201d tendencies of its right wing and also the practice, in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, of gender discrimination \u201creminiscent of Rosa Parks.\u201dAs Clinton pressured Israel to make peace from the State Department, the Obama administration looked to J Street, a new and progressive Jewish lobby, to give members of Congress financial backing and credibility on Israel so that they could support the president without fear of being cash-starved by Aipac or called anti-Israel. J Street boasts of helping Obama defeat an Aipac-backed bill that would have scuttled the administration\u2019s Iran nuclear talks. For the most part, though, unquestioning support for Israel has remained dominant in Washington. Even before she left the administration, Clinton essentially shed any pretense that she was still playing the role of impartial arbiter. As Israel flouted her own government\u2019s demand that it not build more settlements in East Jerusalem, Clinton spoke so effusively about Netanyahu at a December 2012 conference that political observers considered the speech tantamount to a presidential announcement. Since then, Clinton has further distanced herself from her job as secretary of state, making light of her role as Netanyahu\u2019s disciplinarian for Obama and calling herself the president\u2019s \u201cdesignated yeller.\u201dThis explanation of Clinton\u2019s earlier rebukes of Israel is already gospel among her pro-Israel supporters. Lewis, a backer of the independent super PAC Ready for Hillary, told me that Clinton \u201cwas not in the lead on making policy.\u201dClinton\u2019s return to campaign form has left liberal Zionists with little choice other than rationalization. \u201cI sense that the people who advise Hillary Clinton on Jewish politics came of age in an era when the rules of the game were different,\u201d Jeremy Ben-Ami, the founder and president of J Street, told me, suggesting that the time of reflexive support for Israel, regardless of their government\u2019s policies, had ended. When I asked if he could persuade Clinton that such a position was no longer tenable, he answered, not so convincingly, \u201cWe definitely need to try.\u201dOther liberal Zionists are hoping that Bill Clinton could be a more sympathetic voice within a Clinton White House. After Zemel\u2019s Rosh Hashana sermon, in which he talked about the need for \u201cJewish genius\u201d to solve the problem in Israel, Al From told me, \u201cBill Clinton has this little bit of genius.\u201dZemel concurred. \u201cI want Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can get a second round with Bill.\u201dAt a Shabbat service in August, Zemel\u2019s 22-year-old daughter, Ronit, a senior at Macalester College in St. Paul, sat in the front row of Micah\u2019s sanctuary. She listened to her father say, \u201cWhat is needed to make peace between the peoples of these two lands is probably more than humans can summon,\u201d which is from \u201cMy Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel,\u201d a history of the country\u2019s ethical struggle since its independence, by Ari Shavit, a columnist for the left-leaning Israeli paper Haaretz.In a few days Zemel\u2019s daughter would head back to school, where she had served as co-chairwoman of the student wing of J Street, known as J Street U. The idea of going back to campus, she told me, gave her \u201cthe worst feeling ever.\u201d She felt besieged by pro-Palestinian groups advocating boycott, divestment and sanctions, or B.D.S., modeled after the boycott movement that helped end South African apartheid policies. \u201cI\u2019m more ashamed of Israel now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am viewing it from a place of love and caring, and I know that they are not. So I\u2019m very scared.\u201d Shavit expressed a similar concern. In November, he visited Temple Micah, and speaking as a \u201cliberal to liberals\u201d he worried about young American Jews losing their Jewish identity and drifting away from Israel.Chief among the fears of liberal Zionists were groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, which in June helped provide a Jewish seal of approval for the Presbyterian Church to divest from companies seen as profiting from Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Rebecca Vilkomerson, the executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, said that as a result of the war, 60,000 new supporters signed the group\u2019s online petitions or open letters in liberal Jewish publications.Vilkomerson (whose sister, an entertainment writer, is a friend of mine) said she felt no sympathy for the concerns of the liberal Zionist agonistes, whom she considered toothless and intellectually dishonest in their attempts to reconcile their liberal values with Israel\u2019s right-wing government. She reserved special indignation for what she referred to as \u201cPEPs,\u201d or politicians who were \u201cprogressive except for Palestine.\u201dVilkomerson pointed to a Pew poll taken during the summer, which showed that the core constituencies of the Democratic electorate, people under 30, African-Americans and Hispanics, blamed Israel more than Hamas for the war. She was also encouraged by the angry response of some delegates at the 2012 Democratic National Convention who booed an amendment to the party platform that would recognize Jerusalem as the present and future capital of Israel. If the left wing makes the case to Clinton and her Democratic successors that the political calculus on Israel is changing, then, Vilkomerson predicted, they will be forced to recalibrate their position. Hillary Clinton, she said, \u201cis totally politically calculating.\u201dWhile Lewis says that Clinton should \u201ctake seriously\u201d the increasingly intense conversation about the appropriate support for Israel, Clinton, at least for now, is not budging. After all, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator often mentioned as a more liberal alternative to Clinton, has taken much the same position. \u201cI would not argue that this is something to worry about,\u201d Lewis told me.\u201cOne is torn,\u201d Zemel told me from Tel Aviv. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine not wanting to come to Israel every chance I get. But what would happen if an Israeli government were to decide, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re going to declare the entire West Bank to be part of Greater Israel and we\u2019re not going to grant the Palestinians full citizenship.\u2019 How could I then come to visit this country? But how could I not come? I just can\u2019t imagine it.\u201dZemel always felt Israel should be able to chart its own course, without the United States or any other nation forcing its hand. But as the tour progressed and the group encountered stun grenades and concrete blocks in Jerusalem, Zemel said he began to believe that Israel needed an emergency intervention from the United States.\u201cIf a person is killing themselves,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou save them from themselves.\u201dBut there is a sinking feeling among many liberal Zionists that Washington\u2019s opportunity for intervention has passed. The Obama administration\u2019s efforts to broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace have collapsed and its attention has turned to terrorist groups like ISIS and the curbing of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. European nations, frustrated with what they consider America\u2019s unwillingness to force Israel to get out of the West Bank and embrace the two-state solution, have begun to recognize Palestine. Clinton has shown little inclination to risk political damage by reprising her old role as a friend and a critic of Israel.At a Brookings Institution forum in Washington on Dec. 5, Clinton addressed an audience of American Jews and Israeli officials, including Livni. She offered platitudes about the two-state solution and studiously avoided any of her past criticism of Israel. On her way out, as she shook hands and gave hugs, I asked Livni, who is trying to oust Netanyahu in elections in March, if America\u2019s liberal Jews should have any expectation that a new, more progressive Israeli government could form. \u201cIt\u2019s not only their hope,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our hope.\u201dZemel was discouraged by Clinton\u2019s remarks. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d he complained. But he, too, clung to the idea that she had a private view that coincided with his own. \u201cI hope,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a theme that Zemel often returns to when talking about Israel. On Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, he told a Micah congregant who was depressed about Israel\u2019s rightward lurch that Jews were \u201ca people of endless patience\u201d who \u201cview things in the long term.\u201d At the breaking of the fast at his home that evening, he showed off a 19th century text that belonged to his grandfather, when he led the (at the time) liberal Zionist Organization of America \u2014 which is now a right-wing group financed in part by Adelson. Despite everything, Zemel remained optimistic, telling me that the song \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d was a Zionist anthem. \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home? What could be more Jewish?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Japanese Voters Feel Hopeless", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTOKYO \u2014 THE Japanese have a term for hopelessness \u2014 shikata ga nai, \u201cit can\u2019t be helped.\u201d Acceptance of things as they are is deeply embedded in the culture. It also explains why voters are so listless, and even despairing, in the run-up to the national election on Sunday.Japan is in a recession. The popularity of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has been in power for all but four years since 1955, is plummeting. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called an early election to pre-empt the coalescing of an opposition that could threaten his party\u2019s control of Parliament.Mr. Abe says he wants to revive the long-stagnant economy, but his policies have been anything but clear. The government has pumped credit into the economy to raise inflation, weaken the yen and help exporters, but as a result, households have less purchasing power. It has borrowed heavily to finance infrastructure and other stimulus projects, but it has also raised the national sales tax, which sent the economy into a downturn. It wants to make it easier for companies to lay off employees, but it hasn\u2019t found a new way to offer them the economic security they have long expected.Voters are so dispirited that turnout could be at a record low. Yet the Liberal Democratic Party is expected to hold on \u2014 an unfortunate outcome for Japan.Mr. Abe\u2019s real objectives go beyond reviving the economy. He has moved to stack the leadership of NHK, the state broadcaster, with nationalist supporters. In flagrant violation of the pacifist Constitution, his cabinet decreed that Japan\u2019s military would participate in \u201ccollective defense measures\u201d overseas. His government is intent on rewriting the nation\u2019s history of wartime atrocities.These measures are unpopular, but Japanese voters have been apathetic toward them. A big reason is Japan\u2019s history with the United States. For nearly 70 years, Japanese elites have been convinced that America was an essential bulwark against, first, Soviet Communism, and now an expansionist China. American meddling has hindered the development of a progressive political vision and helped the Liberal Democratic Party stay in power.Japan\u2019s economic problems result in part from the breakdown of the postwar social compact. To appease restive workers in the 1950s and \u201960s, successive governments, including one led by Mr. Abe\u2019s grandfather Nobosuke Kishi, persuaded corporations to guarantee job security.For 25 years, this arrangement worked. With meticulous attention to quality, an undervalued currency and comparatively low costs for labor, financing, transportation and supplies, Japanese companies took market share from Western competitors.But once Japan clawed its way to the cutting edge of industrial development, it couldn\u2019t figure out what to do next \u2014 a particular danger in a risk-averse culture. The authorities first tried to focus on investments rather than exports; the result was a property and financial mania, followed by a crash in the early 1990s. The economy at last began to revive during the 2001-06 administration of Junichiro Koizumi, thanks largely to demand from Chinese industrialists for Japanese equipment. Then came the global financial crisis, which made clear once and for all that Japanese companies could no longer provide for people\u2019s economic security. The labor agreements of the postwar decades, when lots of young workers were willing to trade modest paychecks today for economic security tomorrow, are no longer tenable.The Democratic Party of Japan, now in opposition, won a landslide victory in 2009 by proposing to replace lavish public works spending with a strong, Scandinavian-style social safety net that would, in turn, stimulate private consumption. Sadly, three events destroyed the D.P.J. government. The first was a plan to move a United States Marine base in Okinawa to a less populated part of the island (instead of moving it off the island altogether). The second was a proposed sales-tax increase, favored by the powerful Finance Ministry, which can bully prime ministers into submission. The third was the earthquake and tsunami of 2011, which destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.In 2012, the D.P.J. was voted out. Mr. Abe came in and carried out the sales-tax increase, against economists\u2019 advice.Culture doesn\u2019t explain everything, but the Japanese reluctance to acknowledge contradictions \u2014 to act as if everything were the way it should be, even when it isn\u2019t \u2014 helps explain the stasis of recent decades. The sense of living in a world where things happen for inexplicable reasons \u2014 in which the most one can do is adapt as best one can, while giving one\u2019s all \u2014 is pervasive.An Abe victory could mean reduced pension benefits, more regressive taxes, more public spending that benefits the corporate and bureaucratic oligarchy, and more poorly paid temporary work. The men who seek to carry out this program will not cackle with glee like Wall Street bankers; they will bow low with long faces, persuaded that they are participating in a general sacrifice over which they have no choice.And they are likely to get away with it because millions of Japanese will shrug their shoulders at the sclerosis of their political system and the unremitting power of Japan\u2019s bureaucracies and corporations. After all, it can\u2019t be helped.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pierre Moscovici Embodies a Softer Approach to Europe\u2019s Recovery", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 His new portfolio is the entire economy of the European Union. But he still has a financial soft spot in his heart for his native France and other financially challenged countries.Pierre Moscovici, who was the Socialist finance minister of France until this spring, is now the economic policy commissioner for the European Union. In that new role he will have a big say in whether France gets a reprimand, is fined, or instead gets a further reprieve, if it fails to make further adjustments to its 2015 budget, which once again missed European Union deficit targets.And in an interview, he made his opinion clear.While declaring that Europe\u2019s budget rules \u201care made for everybody,\u201d Mr. Moscovici said that \u201csanctions are always a failure\u201d as they only make the target country \u201cfeel stigmatized and create a backlash in public opinion.\u201d\u201cBlunt criticism, French-bashing, are stupid,\u201d said Mr. Moscovici. He said that rather than budget cutting, the European Union should focus on growth and investment as the best ways to hold back a rising tide of populist indignation \u2014 not only in France but in other economically challenged countries like Italy and, in particular, Greece.Mr. Moscovici spoke as political gyrations in Greece, still struggling to emerge from the austerity program required as part of its international bailout, are raising the prospects of a change of government in Athens. A new round of elections that began on Wednesday is renewing questions about whether Greece might leave the euro currency union.Mr. Moscovici is scheduled to meet in Washington on Thursday with Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and the Federal Reserve chief, Janet L. Yellen, in an effort to keep Greece in the eurozone.Greece is \u201cnot only a European issue,\u201d he said, noting the United States\u2019 contributions to the International Monetary Fund, which is one of the major creditors in the country\u2019s bailout. Supporting Greece means \u201cwe need also to have the help of our American friends \u2014 that\u2019s one of the main messages I will carry there,\u201d he said.Mr. Moscovici, who took up his Brussels post in November, wants to be heard above a growing chorus of voices in Germany and elsewhere that deride France as the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d and that insist sound management of the 28-nation European Union may require punishing Paris for its chronic overspending.He and his colleagues at the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, must decide by March whether France has done enough to trim its budget deficit to avoid a sanction that could result in a fine of around 4 billion euros, or $5 billion.Instead of budget discipline, Mr. Moscovici argues that European governments should be spending more and trying harder to attract private investment, to jolt the region\u2019s listless economies from their stupor.That debate has put severe strain on a Franco-German partnership that for decades drove European integration.Despite his robust defense of France, Mr. Moscovici declared himself an impartial defender of European Union interests in his new role overseeing the bloc\u2019s fiscal rule book. It was the sovereign debt crisis, which threatened to destroy the euro currency union, that prompted the European Union and member governments to strengthen the rules on deficit targets.In France\u2019s case, that is supposed to be no more than 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2014 and 3 percent next year. The country, whose deficit is well above 4 percent, has not met its targets for several years, and its 2015 budget as originally submitted this autumn would have missed it again.During Mr. Moscovici\u2019s nomination hearing in the European Parliament in October, some lawmakers questioned whether he might promote a double standard by advocating leniency for France, even as some other countries \u2014 like Spain and Portugal \u2014 continue to struggle after years of painful austerity in trying to meet budgetary targets.Some lawmakers still question Mr. Moscovici\u2019s willingness to enforce the European Union\u2019s budget rules and levy fines, if needed.\u201cWe didn\u2019t introduce the sanction mechanism for nothing,\u201d said Esther de Lange, a Dutch conservative member of influential Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs at the European Parliament. \u201cSo already now taking sanctions off the table is really pushing it.\u201dMs. de Lange said applying the sanction against France, if necessary, would not be a sign that \u201ca bunch of number fetishists\u201d are in charge but a message to France that \u201crunning up deficits that are becoming bigger and bigger and bigger will result in the next generation ending up with a debt that cannot be paid.\u201dThat, she said, \u201cis how a lot of the trouble started the first time round.\u201dBut eurozone countries have often failed to meet the bloc\u2019s targets, and none has ever been fined \u2014 mainly for lack of political will to push the point in Brussels. And certainly now, Mr. Moscovici argues, is not the time to set that precedent.Too many European Union citizens, he said, already believe \u201cthat European policies are only about austerity.\u201d That perception, he said, could mean that by the end of the decade there is \u201cno pro-European majority in the European Parliament.\u201dThose forces have already buffeted France. In the last elections to the European assembly in May, France\u2019s far-right National Front finished ahead of mainstream French parties after a campaign dominated by its denunciations of the European Union as a threat to French sovereignty and prosperity.Anti-Europe parties also scored well in a number of other countries. Syriza, a leftist anti-austerity party in Greece that is highly critical of the euro and is set on renegotiating the Greek sovereign debt and increasing public spending, could come to power next year. Another leftist protest party, Podemos, has surged in popularity in Spain.Mr. Moscovici, 57, cuts a relatively colorful figure in Brussels. Never married and without children, he has often been photographed by the French media with a two-day growth of stubble and a younger girlfriend on his arm. His long-term relationship with a woman about 30 years his junior ended recently, and he has begun dating a woman in her mid-30s.His longtime intellectual and political mentor was the onetime French finance minister and former I.M.F. chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who had been Mr. Moscovici\u2019s seminar teacher at the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration, the hyper-competitive training school for French civil servants.Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist, was considered a likely top candidate to become France\u2019s president, before his career derailed over charges, later dropped, that he sexually assaulted a hotel housekeeper in New York in 2011.At that point, Mr. Moscovici switched his loyalties to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, running his successful 2012 presidential campaign and securing the job as finance minister. Mr. Hollande replaced him as finance minister this past April in a cabinet reshuffle, but then supported Mr. Moscovici as France\u2019s appointee to the European Commission.Jean-Claude Juncker, who was the incoming president of the European Commission, nominated Mr. Moscovici as commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs.Mr. Moscovici said he came to Brussels with a passion to defend the European Union against extremism. Raised in a Jewish family in Paris, Mr. Moscovici is not religiously observant but has followed Jewish tradition by letting his beard grow in recent weeks in homage to his father, a noted psychologist from Romania who died last month. His mother, also a Jewish refugee who arrived in France in the 1940s, is a psychoanalyst originally from Poland.He said he had grown up knowing \u201cwhat fascism was\u201d and how \u201cthe communist system didn\u2019t work.\u201dMr. Moscovici said that bloc of countries that eventually evolved into the European Union found common cause in its early years by memories of World War II and a shared commitment to avoid conflict. Now, once again, he said \u201cthe European project is really in danger.\u201dIt is \u201cnot about history now,\u201d he said. Rather, he continued, \u201cit\u2019s about economics, it\u2019s about jobs, it\u2019s about the future of industry, it\u2019s about our place in globalization.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fresh Start for E.U., but a Big Test Lurks", "Date": "2014-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeBRUSSELS \u2014 Short, snappy and focused on two priorities \u2014 reviving sagging investment in Europe and standing firm toward Russia \u2014 the first European Union summit meeting under new leadership was a demonstrative break with the past.Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who took over the chairmanship of the 28-nation European Council this month, put his briskly opinionated stamp on the meeting of European Union leaders, sending them home a day early after a show of unity and purpose.In his first month, he has shown that he intends to be a major player in European Union foreign policy, driving an Atlanticist agenda of free trade with the United States, partnership with NATO, toughness with Russia and cautious cooperation with China.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the Union\u2019s most powerful leader, was delighted with the first steps of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a fellow conservative from a country that, like her native East Germany, cast off Soviet Communist domination in 1989.She praised \u201ca shorter, more succinct, well-organized Council meeting under our new president, Donald Tusk.\u201dDeparting from the self-effacing, consensual style of his Belgian predecessor, Herman Van Rompuy, Mr. Tusk made clear publicly in advance that he wanted a firm line on maintaining economic sanctions on Russia, which he called \u201cour strategic problem.\u201dMr. Tusk, a former Solidarity student union activist and anti-communist political organizer, said Europeans should regain their self-confidence and realize their own strengths.\u201cThe biggest challenge today is the Russian approach, not only to Ukraine but also to the E.U.,\u201d he said.One European Union official described the contrast between Mr. Van Rompuy and Mr. Tusk as \u201cold school versus business school,\u201d although the Pole is a political bruiser rather than an economist.When ambassadors met the next morning to review the new summit meeting format, there was unanimous praise for Mr. Tusk\u2019s strict chairmanship, which returned the European Council to its intended role of giving strategic guidance to the Union on a handful of key issues instead of on a laundry list of problems.He prevented leaders from making long speeches or getting involved in rewriting the final statement, as often happens.\u201cThey were happy the drafting was left to civil servants and they weren\u2019t asked to get involved,\u201d a European Union diplomat said.Whether that discipline will hold when serious issues of money and power are at stake remains to be seen.Mr. Tusk\u2019s clear line on Russia masked differences between hawks who want to maintain or step up sanctions, and doves like France and Italy, which are eager to ease them at the first sign of Russian cooperation to stabilize eastern Ukraine.Those divergences may widen in mid-2015, when the European Union has to review the curbs on finance, arms sales and technology transfer imposed initially for 12 months.Mr. Tusk was careful not to oversell the initiative to stimulate private investment in Europe\u2019s stalled economy proposed by the European Commission\u2019s new president, Jean-Claude Juncker, saying it was \u201cno silver bullet\u201d but a first step to restore confidence.European Union leaders endorsed the plan intended to plow 315 billion euros, or $388 billion, into transport, energy, research and small business, but some demanded a say on which projects are funded. Brussels, in agreement with investors, wants to keep decisions in the hands of European Investment Bank experts to avoid financing national politicians\u2019 pet programs. This may be the first test of whether Europe\u2019s new leadership can resist pressure to renationalize decision making.The eurozone crisis of 2010-13 changed the balance of power in the Union, giving more say to national governments that hold the purse strings and less to the European Commission, which has seen its sole right to initiate European Union legislation gradually eroded.Mr. Juncker has bent to the prevailing euroskeptic winds, announcing a work program last week that will withdraw 80 pieces of planned regulation, including clean air and waste management rules, and propose only 25 new initiatives next year. He and Mr. Tusk have opted to take issues off the table where they perceive there is little chance of agreement.But centrifugal forces are still hard at work, now tugging at the commission\u2019s core competences of policing competition, upholding single market rules and negotiating trade deals.To be sure, it\u2019s not all one-way traffic. The commission has gained more oversight over national budget deficits, although its powers are being tested by defiance from Paris and Rome.The European Central Bank, the federal institution in charge of the 18-nation currency union, acquired more power during the crisis, not just as the de facto backstop for the eurozone but also by gaining control of banking supervision.Yet the central bank, too, faces a backlash from some governments and national central banks, notably in Germany and the Netherlands, which are trying to clip its wings and inhibit it from printing money to buy government bonds in an effort to revive inflation.Europe\u2019s new start will be put to the test in 2015 by monetary controversy, potential political upheaval and economic stagnation. Mr. Tusk and Mr. Juncker have won plaudits in their first weeks in office, but the real ordeal is still to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Unbound", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere may not be a lightness to his step, a lilt in his voice or a bit of jauntiness returned to his manner. The office ages everyone prematurely, and makes spontaneity all but impossible. But President Obama is acting like a man who\u2019s been given the political equivalent of a testosterone boost. Perhaps the best thing to happen to him was the crushing blow his party took in the midterm elections. Come January, Republicans will have their largest House majority in 84 years \u2014 since Herbert Hoover was president. Granted, no politician wants to join Hoover and history in the same sentence. But Obama is not cowering or conceding. He\u2019s been liberated by defeat, becoming the president that many of his supporters hoped he would be. He promised to be transformative. Instead, especially in the last two years, he\u2019s been listless, passive, a spectator to his own presidency. Rather than setting things in motion, he reacted to events. Even Ebola, the great scare that prompted so much media hysteria it was awarded Lie of the Year by PolitiFact, was somehow his fault. No more. Of late, the president who has nothing to lose has discovered that his best friend is the future. On normalizing relations with Cuba, on a surprising climate change initiative with China, on an immigration gamble that\u2019s working, and executive orders to protect the world\u2019s greatest wild salmon fishery in Alaska or try to root out gender pay disparities, Obama is marching ahead of politicians fighting yesterday\u2019s wars. In setting an aggressive agenda, he has forced opponents to defend old-century policies, and rely on an aging base to do it. Are Republicans really going to spend the first year of their new majority trying to undo everything the president has done \u2014 to roll back the clock? Will they defend isolation of Cuba against the wishes of most young Cuban-Americans? Will they restore a family-destroying deportation policy, when Obama\u2019s de-emphasis on sending illegal immigrants home has already given him a 15-point boost among Latinos? Will they take away health insurance from millions who never had it before? Will they insist that nothing can be done on climate change, while an agreement is on the table for the world\u2019s two biggest polluters, the United States and China, to do something significant?The President Obama of the last six weeks is willing to take that bet. The tediously cautious, adrift president who governed before his party was rejected in November never would have. Of course, it helps to have the wind at his back \u2014 gusts of good news. Remember when Mitt Romney promised to bring unemployment down to 6 percent by the end of his first term? Obama has done him one better: two years ahead of schedule, unemployment is 5.8 percent. The economy added 321,000 jobs last month and average hourly wages actually rose, on pace to make 2014 the best year for financially battered Americans in almost a decade. And if there\u2019s a Republican somewhere who predicted that gas prices would be well below $3 a gallon in year six of the Obama presidency, bring that prescient pol forward. Remember, also, the man-crush that Republicans had on Vladimir Putin? Ohhh, Vlad \u2014 such a leader! Forceful, militarily aggressive, a manly man. Obama the plodder was getting played by Putin the Great. Now, the Russian president better keep his shirt on, for his country is teetering, increasingly isolated, its currency in free fall. Plunging oil prices have shown just how fragile a nation dependent on oil can be. And speaking of oil, the incoming Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has vowed, as one of his first orders of business, to push forward Keystone XL, the proposed pipeline to move Canada\u2019s dirty oil though the American heartland. There\u2019s one problem: With low energy prices, the pipeline may no longer pencil out. It\u2019s a bust, potentially, in a free market awash with cheap oil.With the Cuba opening, one of those events that seem obvious to all the minute it takes shape, the president has Pope Francis as a diplomatic co-conspirator. This leaves Republican opponents of fresh air in Havana lecturing the most popular man on the planet. Even after that all-dogs-go-to-heaven thing turned out to be something that was lost in translation, the pope\u2019s blessing of the Cuba initiative will beat hot air from a half-dozen senators. Obama\u2019s trademark caution in a crisis still serves him well. He kept his head during the Ebola meltdown when everyone else was losing theirs. Had we gone jaw to jaw with Putin over Ukraine, rather than building the case for sanctions, the world would be far messier. But in finally learning how to use the tools of his office, Obama unbound is a president primed to make his mark. Gail Collins is off today. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hotels Let Guests Borrow Items or Leave Them", "Date": "2014-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil last year, when she became a planning consultant for a college in Florida, Alison Barlow traveled almost full time for an information technology company. She was away as long as three weeks a month, making it home on weekends about half the time.When a hotel stay at a Hampton Inn in suburban Omaha was punctuated by a bout of flu, the staff made drugstore runs and brought her tea and crackers. Knowing she would return soon, she would leave a bag behind with toiletries, workout wear and extra clothes. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to check luggage on an airplane,\u201d she said. While staying at a Candlewood Suites, she borrowed books and DVDs.While loan programs are an accepted feature at luxury and full-service hotels, experts say that those hotels are now expanding their offerings to include bicycles, automobiles and running gear. And hotels on a lower tier, like Candlewood Suites, are starting their own programs.\u201cIt\u2019s reached all the way down from luxury to full-service hotels, and it\u2019s not unusual for select service,\u201d says Bjorn Hanson, professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University.Bonnie Knutson, a professor at Michigan State University\u2019s School of Hospitality Business, said she saw an emphasis on choice, personalization and customization. \u201cGuests are saying, \u2018I only want to pay for what I want to use,' \u201d she said.The Kimpton program offers a variety of small items and appliances, including chargers, hair dryers, extension cords and curling irons.The program is aimed at the female traveler. \u201cWomen tend to travel with a lot more things in their luggage,\u201d she said. The program is offered under different names at all Hyatt brands.In addition to lending books and DVDs, Candlewood Suites, an extended-stay division of the InterContinental Hotels Group, introduced a Lending Locker in 300 hotels in October 2013. The floor-to-ceiling enclosure provides items not typically found in guest rooms including fans, crockpots, dehumidifiers and office supplies.Robert Radomski, vice president for brand management at I.H.G.'s extended-stay brands, which include Candlewood Suites, says the program creates a feeling of belonging for guests. \u201cIt adds to their comfort,\u201d he said.Peter Shankman, an entrepreneur and author of the coming book \u201cZombie Loyalists\u201d was one. Fourteen months ago, at a Westin in Atlanta, he was up at 5 a.m. for a run before an early meeting. After donning his shorts, he realized he forgot to pack running socks. Expecting to run a 10-kilometer race three days later, he thought wearing dress socks for a seven-mile run that morning invited blisters.The front desk staff offered him a free pair of running socks. \u201cThey allowed me to continue on a schedule I preferred, which meant more to me than anything,\u201d he said.Still, he has not traveled without his own equipment since. A Westin hotel typically charges $5 per stay for the socks, freshly laundered workout wear in a variety of sizes for both sexes, and sneakers that are cleaned and disinfected after each use. The inner soles are changed monthly.Fitness appeal takes different forms. In July 2013, Kimpton, in partnership with Public, a San Francisco boutique bicycle and equipment company, introduced a fleet of Kimpton-branded bicycles that are free for guests to use. Two to 10 bikes are available at 61 locations.For guests who prefer four wheels, in March Loews introduced a chauffeur-driven car at five locations nationwide to take guests to nearby destinations. Guests are responsible for their return transportation to the hotel. At locations in Miami, Hollywood and Santa Monica, the hotels also offer free Fiat loaner cars.Even as loan programs can create greater loyalty and perhaps a willingness to pay a premium for a specific hotel, they have potential drawbacks, according to one expert, who sees the possibility that fewer guests will request items in the future, because of concerns about health and well-being.\u201cSome hotels may temporarily suspend these items as a precautionary response to protecting guest health and reducing liability,\u201d Henry Harteveldt, an analyst at Atmosphere Research Group, wrote in an email.For some guests, like Ms. Barlow, a preferred amenity is the ability to leave belongings behind. Mike DeFrino, the chief operating officer at Kimpton Hotels, said he had noticed at locations in Cambridge, Mass., and Cupertino, Calif., as many as 5 percent of guests are leaving bags behind. \u201cAt Cupertino, they leave suits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to travel with blazers.\u201dBy accepting guest property for safekeeping, hotels run the risk of losing reputation and loyalty if something happens to it. \u201cThe worst thing is to lose or misplace a guest item,\u201d Mr. Hanson said.Ms. Barlow said she drew the line at leaving a laptop. Still, even as her travel has abated, she said she missed staying long enough to establish a rapport with the hotel staff.Advertisement"}

Like many women, she is not working but wishes she were.Since Kerry Devine, 32, and her friends began having children, she has noticed a stark difference between her female friends in Auburn, Wash., where she lives, and those in England and Cyprus, where she grew up. In the United States, they almost all stopped working outside the home, at least until their children were in school. Yet, she says, she can\u2019t think of a friend in Europe who left work after her children were born.Ms. Devine quit her job after she had her first child, a girl, four years ago, because she thought 12 weeks of maternity leave was too short. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to leave her in day care or pay for the expenses of it,\u201d she said. When she gave birth to twin boys this year, a return to work \u2014 she had been a property manager for apartment buildings \u2014 looked even less plausible.Her story would have played out differently, she said, if she had been living in her native England. Like many European countries, Britain offers a year of maternity leave, much of it paid, and protections for part-time workers, among other policies aimed at keeping women employed.\u201cI would have been O.K. putting a 1-year-old baby in day care, but not a 12-week-old,\u201d Ms. Devine said. \u201cMore flexible hours and being able to work from home part of the time definitely would have made a big difference.\u201dHer thinking is shared by many American women \u2014 and plays a role in a significant economic reversal. As recently as 1990, the United States had one of the top employment rates in the world for women, but it has now fallen behind many European countries. After climbing for six decades, the percentage of women in the American work force peaked in 1999, at 74 percent for women between 25 and 54. It has fallen since, to 69 percent today.In many other countries, however, the percentage of working women has continued to climb. Switzerland, Australia, Germany and France now outrank the United States in prime-age women\u2019s labor force participation, as do Canada and Japan.But the experience of not working is also considerably more positive for women than men, the poll shows, which means that women are often not desperate to return to work. Women are more likely to say that not working has improved their romantic relationships, while men are more likely to say those relationships have suffered. Women who aren\u2019t working spend more time exercising than they once did. Men spend less.Still, many women also seem interested in working again \u2014 under the right conditions. And near the top of the list of those requirements is the flexibility to avoid upending their family life. Many fewer women than men said they would be willing to take a job with trade-offs that might significantly affect their lives: moving to a different city, commuting more than an hour each way, or working nontraditional hours. Notably, women with children at home account for many of the differences. Women without children often have attitudes about unemployment that are more similar to men\u2019s, the poll shows.For many women with children, it seems, the decision about work involves weighing a particularly complex set of benefits and drawbacks. And often the challenge is insurmountable in part because there is a dearth of programs and policies in the United States to support women in their prime career and childbearing years. In Europe, meanwhile, such policies have continued to expand and evolve in recent years. They include subsidized child care, generous parental leaves and taxation of individuals instead of families, which encourages women\u2019s employment. Social acceptance of working motherhood has also made a difference in countries like France, where the birthrate has risen even as more women enter the work force.But the reversal in the employment rate of prime-age women, most of whom have children, has been more surprising.Among less-educated and lower-income women, the stresses of trying to work and raise children are particularly challenging.\u201cIt\u2019s tougher and tougher for women to make it worthwhile to work,\u201d Ms. Stone said. \u201cFor low- and middle-income families, it literally isn\u2019t worth going to work if the cost of child care exceeds what you\u2019d bring in, and that calculus is exacerbated in an economic downturn.\u201dOf American women who are not working, according to the Times/CBS/Kaiser poll, 17 percent did not graduate from high school and 77 percent did not graduate from college. Just 7 percent have a graduate degree.Raquell Heredia, who is 27 and lives in Fontana, Calif., is an example. She is not working but wishes she were. \u201cI just like working with people,\u201d she said. \u201cI like being able to provide for my family.\u201dAfter she became pregnant two years ago, she had severe morning sickness. She had no sick leave and had to quit her job as a waitress and bartender. When her first child, who is now 9,was born, she was working at a pharmacy, but left because it provided little maternity leave and no place to pump breast milk.\u201cI think that they should make it a lot easier, like for parents to have holidays off with their kids,\u201d she said.Women in France, meanwhile, tell a different story. In numerous interviews, they said the system supported them as they tried to keep their careers after having children.\u201cIf you want to work full time, everything is there in France to make that possible,\u201d said Abbey Ansart, 36, a strategic consultant at an American software company in Paris who has three children. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have had the career in the U.S. that I have here.\u201dLike every mother in France, Delphine Dubost, a public-school teacher in Paris, was required to take a month and a half off before the births of her children. She was also able to take two and a half months of maternity leave afterward, all while receiving her full paycheck. After her second child, the law permitted her to work 80 percent of full time without a salary cut. She enrolled her children in France\u2019s state-run day care system where, for about $740 a month, children receive organic meals and even diapers. \u201cIt was great,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can keep working, but can also spend time with your children.\u201dThe employment decline in the United States is especially striking, because it has long preferred flexible labor markets \u2014 rather than extensive benefits, like those in Europe \u2014 in the name of job growth. Europe\u2019s long list of regulations and benefits, including family leave policies, still seem to be exacting a cost on the Continent\u2019s economies. But it\u2019s now clear the American approach has its costs, too: The free market leaves many families, particularly many women, struggling to find a solution that combines work and home life.The policies that give European parents generous leaves and free diapers also influence attitudes.\u201cIt is very intuitive that the fact that they provide more generous work-family policies and that they have been expanding these policies in recent years is one reason they have moved ahead of the U.S.,\u201d Ms. Blau said.Across the country, 16 percent of prime-age men are not working. Examine non-employment rates for every Census tract.These policies have been crucial for retaining mothers in the labor force. In a majority of countries in the eurozone, 20 to 40 percent of jobs held by women are part time, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.There is a flip side to these policies. Part-time jobs are often low-paid, with little opportunity for advancement. \u201cFrom a gender-equality perspective, there are problems with this,\u201d said Willem Adema, a senior economist in the O.E.C.D.'s social policy division in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of relatively limited access to good-quality jobs.\u201dThe study by Ms. Blau and Mr. Kahn found that while men and women were equally likely to be managers in the United States, women were half as likely as men to be managers in Europe. The combined executive committees of the 40 biggest French blue-chip-listed companies have only 45 women. None of those companies have a female chief executive.Daria Ostaptschuk had been in a diplomatic position with the O.E.C.D. in Paris when her child was born 10 years ago. When she returned to work part time, \u201cmy chances were not so good in advancing my career,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trade-off is you are getting squeezed as a half-time worker, plus you don\u2019t get the good jobs.\u201d She now runs her own translation business.The wage gap between men and women has shrunk in the United States and in a number of European countries since the mid-1990s. But it hasn\u2019t budged in France \u2014 and has grown in Italy and Portugal.Sometimes, cultural attitudes hold back working mothers. In Germany, labor market reforms in the 1990s led to more mothers entering the work force. But a cultural backlash rose in some corners against mothers who chose to spend time at work; a derogatory nickname \u2014 Rabenmutter, or \u201craven mothers\u201d \u2014 was coined for those who pushed their children out of the house into day care.Policy makers and employers in Europe and the United States seem to be making a calculation: Either keep a growing share of women employed or allow them good jobs and promising career paths. Neither seems to have figured out how to consistently do both.There are signs that some American women, particularly college-educated ones, may be figuring out a new solution. They seem to be taking time out of the work force when they have children and returning when those children are older, according to data from Ms. Goldin at Harvard. That is certainly what many women would like to do. Of those women who are out of work and identify as homemakers in the Times/CBS/Kaiser poll, 67 percent said it was likely that they would be working five years from now.Charlotte Mayo, 51, may be one of them. She left her job as a factory worker in her late 30s, when she began fertilization treatments. \u201cI see a lot of middle-aged and older women becoming parents now, and they leave,\u201d she said. She now stays home in Pomfret, Conn., with her 10-year-old twins, but said she would consider returning to work when they were older.The plan is a gamble. Ms. Devine, the British mother who lives in Washington State with three children under 5 years old, would like to return to school to switch careers to a medical field like radiography when they are of school age. But she is pragmatic about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m hirable anymore,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve been out of the work force for so long.\u201dHow the Poll Was Conducted: The telephone poll was conducted Nov. 11 to\n25 with 1,002 adults ages 25 to 54, including\n639 nonworking women.

{"Headline": "At 107, a Buffalo Bills Fan Who Sees It All", "Date": "2014-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayORCHARD PARK, N.Y. \u2014 Let\u2019s start with the fact that my grandmother Evelyn Elliott is 107 years old. Add to this that she gave up driving only five years ago, can Skype from her iPad and rode out November\u2019s blizzard stranded in the modest house where she has lived since 1932. Yet these are minor points of family lore when you consider how she spends her Sunday afternoons. The woman is a football fanatic. There is no visiting Grandma during a Buffalo Bills game unless you plan to sit in reverent silence \u2014 except if they score, at which point you will hear a faint centenarian whoop. And definitely don\u2019t bother her with talk of brain injuries or domestic abuse scandals or cheerleaders who are not being paid. \u201cI\u2019m just about the game,\u201d she says with the kind of steely resolve one gets after surviving two world wars and the Great Depression, among other calamities.If football is Grandma\u2019s second religion (she has been known to miss church on big game days), then the Bills are her alternate parish, yielding an extended collection of great-grandchildren to be both heralded and scolded. No one runs faster than defensive back Aaron Williams, but if he misses an interception, she purses her lips. Others may be wowed by a new draft pick, but to Grandma, he is \u201cstill a rookie\u201d who must carry his weight. Touchdowns are great and all, but if you want to impress her, pull off a Hail Mary pass.As one of six grandchildren reared within this prove-your-worth dynamic, I have long searched for a way to understand the inner workings of this woman\u2019s mind. It finally struck me that football might be the route. So we headed to Ralph Wilson Stadium last Sunday for the Bills\u2019 final home game of the season.\u201cWhat are you thinking right now?\u201d I asked her on the drive over.\u201cYou ask too many questions,\u201d she replied.WE SOON HIT a traffic jam near the stadium, passing a tailgate party like the one Grandma had recently attended with her nurse, Sue. (Grandma mostly uses a wheelchair after two broken hips in recent years, but this has never kept her from a good party.)In the Buffalo tailgating tradition, fans gather around their cars in parking lots and drink a lot of Labatt Blue beer while feasting on the food that represents the opponent. If the Bills are up against the Miami Dolphins, it\u2019s fish. On this day, the Bills were playing the Green Bay Packers, so cheese platters were in abundance. As Grandma looked toward the stadium, her face turned serious. The Packers had never won a road game against Buffalo, but this time they were bringing their future Hall of Fame quarterback, Aaron Rodgers. Just the word \u201cquarterback\u201d causes Bills fans to stiffen a little. Early in the season, the team made a switch at that position, replacing E. J. Manuel with Kyle Orton, but he, too, had been less than dazzling. If Grandma was sure of one thing, it was this: Whatever the Bills lacked on the field that day, they would more than make up for in the stands.Bills fans are unabashedly fanatical. The team is a version of its underdog town, which has taken the same boom-and-bust path of other small postindustrial cities struggling to survive in the new economy. Through all of the highs and lows, Buffalo has found in the Bills an unwavering and noble cause to rally around. After parking our car, we were escorted into an elevator that led to an entrance ramp to the field. \u201cI have never met anybody who\u2019s 107 years old,\u201d the elevator operator said.\u201cMe neither,\u201d Grandma replied.As we descended the ramp into the open field, I caught the first flicker of emotion on Grandma\u2019s face. She had not been to the stadium since she was in her 90s (an age that for most people is a bookend; for Grandma, it was just the start of another chapter). Year after year, Grandma\u2019s television was her only portal into this field. When she traded up to a 60-inch flat screen, she felt closer. But there is nothing like being there, before that wide expanse of green.\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna cry,\u201d she said.Just then, Terry Pegula strode up, his hand extended. It did not occur to Grandma that the Bills were seeing a possible publicity bonanza in this article. She stared at him and said, with a hint of warning, \u201cThanks for keeping the Bills in Buffalo.\u201d Half an hour later, we had taken our seats in a heated box, and the game began. The Bills fell behind early, 3-0. But late in the first quarter, Marcus Thigpen returned a Green Bay punt 75 yards for a touchdown, the kind of play that might happen once a year for any team.\u201cTouchdown!\u201d Grandma yelped inaudibly as the stadium erupted. \u201cYou don\u2019t see all that when you\u2019re watchin\u2019 at home,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a great play.\u201dI kept trying to discern what it was about the game that captivated Grandma\u2019s mind. I knew she paid close attention to strategy.\u201cWhat do you think happens in the huddle?\u201d I tried.\u201cThey decide what to do,\u201d she sniffed (in the tone of \u201cAre you an idiot or what?\u201d).I HAVE INTERVIEWED militant jihadists, prosecutors, drug dealers and counterterrorism specialists at the Central Intelligence Agency. None of them prepared me for the challenge of extracting personal information from my grandmother. Ask her about church or baking, and she is loquacious. Try to psychoanalyze her, and you get a cocked brow. (This might explain why she is especially fond of the Bills\u2019 defensive line.) To be fair, Grandma is the product of a no-nonsense upbringing, which she can still recount in shimmering detail. Her father was a baker named Emil Wahl who had come to America from Stuttgart, Germany, settling in East Buffalo, where he met and married Emma Nitzschke, the daughter of German immigrants. By the time my grandmother was born in 1907, the second youngest of eight children, her father owned a bakery on Metcalfe Street, delivering bread from a horse and buggy for 5 cents a loaf. The family lived above the bakery in an apartment with no indoor plumbing and later moved to a 24-acre farm on Walden Avenue, where the Wahls began raising pigs for a living. On weekdays, Grandma would walk nearly a mile along a dirt road, often chased by geese, to reach a two-room schoolhouse (\u201cFour grades in one room, four in the other.\u201d). When she was 14, she and her sisters decided to try a vocational school instead. She learned to type but soon quit \u201cbecause every time the tuition would come up, we\u2019d have to almost break my father\u2019s arm to get the money,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I got sick of that.\u201d At the dawn of the Roaring Twenties, Grandma, 15 by then, found a job in the alterations section of a men\u2019s department store, earning $1 a day, six days a week. She spent her scant free time mastering the Charleston, taking sun at Lake Erie, and serving ice cream and cake at the annual peach festival, where in 1926 she first laid eyes on a handsome Southerner named Charles Elliott. A former Marine from Jackson, Tenn., he had served in World War I before attending Cornell and was now working at Westinghouse Electric as an electrical engineer. Perhaps most impressive, he drove a car \u2014 a Jordan with side curtains \u2014 and offered to pick my grandmother up for their third date at 5 a.m. This gave her pause, until he explained his reasoning.He wanted to take her to a football game at Cornell, and they would have a long drive ahead. AT THE BEGINNING of the third quarter last Sunday, with the score tied, 10-10, I started up with my questions again. She frowned.\u201cI can\u2019t concentrate when people talk,\u201d she snapped. Grandma\u2019s spectator style might best be described as Zen. She watches the game closely and calmly, getting neither flustered nor excited. This disposition mirrors her general approach to life. \u201cI just go with it,\u201d she likes to say. \u201cI take it as it comes. Let the best man win.\u201dIn the third quarter, Buffalo was the better team and methodically built a 16-10 lead. But now Rodgers had the ball again, and the Bills would have to find a way to keep him and the Packers from answering. Grandma was well versed enough in football to know what was at stake.\u201cTime for them to make some noise,\u201d she said of her fellow fans as the Bills\u2019 defense tried to pressure Rodgers. \u201cIt\u2019s the third down.\u201dAs it turned out, early in the fourth quarter, Rodgers was intercepted on a third-down play by the strikingly named Bacarri Rambo, who had been signed by the Bills just a month earlier. The interception led to another field goal by the Bills and a 19-10 lead.Grandma seemed pleased but unfazed.\u201cIt\u2019s going about the way I expected,\u201d she said. \u201cIntuition.\u201dGRANDMA SAW HER FIRST football game almost 90 years ago, on that day trip to Cornell. She acknowledges paying little attention to the sport; she was far more taken with the gentleman who had escorted her there. By the time Charlie and Evie, as they were known, married four years later, the Depression had hit, and football took a back seat to weightier matters. Grandma considered herself lucky that her husband had kept his job at a time when neighbors were begging for food. But to avoid being laid off, he was working only every other week. \u201cMarried women didn\u2019t work\u201d back then, she recalled, but to help her husband make up for the lost income, she took part in raising chickens in the backyard of the house they had built, and sold the eggs door to door.With the arrival of three sons (my father, Robert, coming last), Grandma spent the next few decades shuttling among her housework, the two church choirs she led, and the cooking and baking classes she taught. Like many women of her time, she knew she had untapped potential. She jumped at the chance, in the 1950s, to run her brother Clarence\u2019s store, Wahl\u2019s Candies (which is still in business). But it was a short-lived affair.Grandma mostly tended to her children and husband, who had been a Bills devotee from the team\u2019s 1960 inception. Three decades later, he would quietly watch the Sunday game while she tuned it out, fixing dinner instead. In 1991, Grandpa fell gravely ill right before my cousin Camille\u2019s wedding in Geneva. So Grandma went to Europe by herself, and there, of all places, she discovered the Bills.It was the start of a magical era for the team, which was heading to the Super Bowl with a shining quarterback named Jim Kelly. Being a proud woman, Grandma was irked that so many Europeans seemed to know more about her own team \u2014 and this American sport \u2014 than she did. She returned home ready to learn the game and watched that first Bills Super Bowl with her husband at her side. The Bills lost. Grandpa died nine months later. His absence left an aching void to fill every Sunday. Watching the game became Grandma\u2019s new ritual.With Kelly at the helm, the Bills were the only team to make it to four consecutive Super Bowls. Although they lost all four, they gained a sacred kind of devotion from my grandmother.She was now a Bills fan.WITH LESS THAN five minutes to go in the fourth quarter last Sunday, the Packers kicked a field goal of their own, cutting Buffalo\u2019s lead to 19-13. Could the Bills hold on?\u201cAnother touchdown, they\u2019d have \u2019em,\u201d Grandma said as her team prepared to go back on offense.But they didn\u2019t seem to hear her. The Bills moved the ball past midfield but could not advance any farther and punted with two minutes to go, giving Rodgers and the Packers the opening they needed. A last-second touchdown, and Green Bay could win, 20-19.But on the very next play, Rodgers was sacked on his own 3-yard line and fumbled the ball into the end zone, leading to a safety for the Bills (another rare play for Grandma to witness).\u201cOh, boy!\u201d Grandma squealed. \u201cOh, boy!\u201d Her face lit up as the crowd went wild. It was something to no longer be watching alone, to be just one fan among many. \u201cI think you are good luck, Grandma,\u201d I said.\u201cI think so,\u201d she said, beaming.LATER THAT EVENING, we were back at Grandma\u2019s, sitting around the same mahogany Duncan Phyfe table where four generations of Elliotts had gathered for meals. Grandma quietly savored her slice of pepperoni pizza with the same focus with which she watches the games. We reminisced about the day\u2019s highlights. How she got to meet Jim Kelly. How she reminded Terry Pegula to keep her team in her town.Then there was that moment, right before the game, when running back Fred Jackson walked up to greet her.We wondered aloud if Grandma might have taken a liking to the handsome Jackson, who is still running strong at the ripe age of 33. She paused, breaking into a smile.\u201cHe\u2019s too old for me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Recent Black College Graduates, a Tougher Road to Employment", "Date": "2014-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWilliam Zonicle did what all the job experts advise. He majored in a growing field like health care. He studied hard and took time to develop relationships with his professors. Most important, he obtained a great internship in the human resources department at Florida Hospital in Tampa the summer before his senior year.But more than seven months after receiving his diploma from Oakwood University, a historically black religious school in Huntsville, Ala., Mr. Zonicle is still without a job in his field. Instead, he is working part-time for $7.60 an hour at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in the center of town.\u201cIt was tougher than I expected,\u201d said Mr. Zonicle, 23, who applied for jobs at hospitals and nursing homes from Ohio to Florida after graduating in May. \u201cBecause of the work I had put in as an undergraduate, and making connections, I thought it would be easier to find a decent position.\u201dCollege graduates have survived both the recession and ho-hum recovery far better than those without a degree, but blacks who finished four years of college are suffering from unemployment rates that are painfully high compared with their white counterparts.Among recent graduates ages 22 to 27, the jobless rate for blacks last year was 12.4 percent versus 4.9 percent for whites, said John Schmitt, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.While there has always been a gap between black and white college grads, this 7.5 percentage point difference was far greater than before the recession burned through the economy. In 2007, for example, there was only a 1.4 percentage point difference, with 4.6 percent of recent black graduates out of work compared with 3.2 percent of similarly educated whites.Historically, the periods during and immediately after downturns have been harder on blacks than on whites. But in this current cycle, the trend has been even more extreme.Younger workers absorbed the brunt of job losses during the Great Recession, so black college graduates, also subject to persistent racial discrimination despite advances in civil rights, suffered from a double disadvantage, the report concluded.Although the numbers of whites, blacks and Latinos graduating from college have surged in recent years, the number of black graduates is still relatively small. Of the 1.9 million college graduates ages 22 to 27 who were unemployed in 2013, 57,000 were black.Politicians, economists and business leaders are united in the view that despite staggering tuition and fees at many institutions, college is worth the cost.And it still is, despite the significant hit college graduates have taken in recent years. Particularly when considering the alternatives.\u201cI would never say to anyone they shouldn\u2019t get a college education,\u201d said William A. Darity Jr., an economist at Duke University. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that having a college education improves the relative situation of any black American compared with any other black American.\u201d\u201cBut it does not significantly reduce racial disparity,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something else to really have an effect on that.\u201dBlack graduates are suffering from a version of last hired, first fired, Mr. Darity said. The effects of discrimination are blunted when the work force is expanding, but in harder times minorities are much more vulnerable, he said.For many recent black graduates, the benefits of a college education haven\u2019t yet lived up to the promise. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised I haven\u2019t gotten any job,\u201d said Garrick Ewers, 22, a business administration major who donned a cap and gown this spring at Morehouse College, a historically black men\u2019s college in Atlanta.Mr. Ewers, who would like to work in marketing, applied to Google, Apple, BET, MTV and Amazon, among others.When those didn\u2019t come through, he looked at picking up some work nearby as a cashier or a waiter. \u201cI\u2019m applying for jobs I know I\u2019m overqualified for,\u201d he said, \u201cand I haven\u2019t even been getting those.\u201dHe took a job a couple of weeks ago at a video store near his home for $8.50 an hour.Many of his classmates are having similar problems, said Mr. Ewers, who moved back home after graduation. \u201cMy parents have been very helpful, but I know they\u2019re getting sick of it,\u201d he said.The unemployment gap between black and white college graduates narrows as people grow older. Last year it was 3.5 percent for whites, versus 5.7 percent for blacks. But the delay in finding a job can reverberate years down the road, reducing wages over a lifetime.Christopher Broughton, a business administration major in Mr. Ewers\u2019s class at Morehouse, was an intern at Adobe Systems in San Francisco the previous summer, but the hoped-for job after graduation never came through. Over the summer, Mr. Broughton, 22, said he sent at least 70 applications to large and small firms, using LinkedIn and online research. In October, he finally landed a job in Atlanta with Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate brokerage firm.Mr. Zonicle, the Oakwood graduate, searched for jobs at hospitals, medical centers and nursing homes in the Huntsville area and throughout Florida. Following up on leads he learned of through the business administration department at his college, he also sent his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to hospitals in Ohio and Atlanta, explaining that he would be happy to relocate.Most of the applications were filed online, he said, and he never heard back, let alone got a chance to find out why he was not selected.So with his part-time low-wage job at Barnes & Noble, Mr. Zonicle can now count himself among the 56 percent of recent black college graduates who are considered to be \u201cunderemployed\u201d or working in jobs that don\u2019t require a degree. That figure was up from about 45 percent before the recession, according to the report by the economic and policy research center.Even degrees in science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 so-called STEM fields where the demand is high \u2014 have not immunized recent black graduates against job search difficulty. From 2010 to 2012, the average unemployment rate among young black engineers was 10 percent, the center reported, while the underemployment rate was 32 percent.The evidence suggests that black graduates, with fewer resources to fall back on, are even more aggressive than whites in pursuing a job. But that hasn\u2019t been enough to overcome obstacles.\u201cI had disappointing times before,\u201d Mr. Zonicle said, \u201cbut when you\u2019re expecting and hoping for something to come through and it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s hard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Liability Risk for Airbnb Hosts ", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyOver the last few years, Uber and Airbnb have come to be known as leaders of something called the sharing economy.\u201cIf you\u2019re conducting a business, on a full- or part-time basis, by renting out your home or apartment (or a room in your home or apartment) as a way to earn money, your homeowner\u2019s or renter\u2019s insurance policy probably would not provide liability coverage,\u201d said Rebecca Hirsch, a USAA spokeswoman, in an email.Insurance companies are not fond of liars either, nor of people who conveniently neglect to tell them that they are running a small-scale hotel. \u201cAn insured has the obligation to be forthcoming about all facts relating to his/her insured property. Not doing so could impact coverage and jeopardize the continuation of insurance,\u201d said Laura Strykowski, an Allstate spokeswoman.Second, it knows that some insurance companies have exceptions of various sorts. Allstate allows people to rent out their home for a week or two while still maintaining liability coverage for people who stay there. Ms. Hirsch of USAA said that for people who \u201cvery occasionally rent a room out (as opposed to doing this as a business), liability coverage may be available.\u201d Chubb offers coverage as long as you\u2019re not taking in more than $15,000 a year in rental income, which it believes is more generous than most other insurance companies.Insurers handle claims on a case-by-case basis. Facts matter. Lawyers get involved and exploit loopholes. Hey, it could all work out well for Airbnb, at least some of the time, right? Clearly, the company thinks it\u2019s worth trying.Scott Wolf, president of the program division for CBIZ Insurance Services, which provides the Assure policy, broke the host\u2019s cost down: For a $1 million, four-bedroom home with contents worth $100,000, the annual cost of coverage would be about $3,000, which includes any damage, liability coverage and replacement of rental income in case the home is temporarily uninhabitable. Most Airbnb properties are worth less than this, its hosts may rent only part of their homes and do so less often, and the company would get a bulk discount if it were to buy coverage for all of them. Still, multiply that times 800,000 listings and it\u2019s easy to see why it\u2019s out of the question for Airbnb to hand out primary coverage to everyone.So why doesn\u2019t the company do what HomeAway does and offer hosts the option to buy a ready-made primary insurance solution for their renting activities? \u201cWe wanted the experience for our hosts to be automatic and easy and offer real peace of mind,\u201d said Jonathan Golden, the Airbnb product leader who has been working on insurance issues for over three years, \u201cversus going to another site and potentially having to purchase another policy.\u201d\u201cThis makes it more attractive to host from Airbnb,\u201d Mr. Bradshaw added.Airbnb shared that data with its underwriters (who are making the company pay an unspecified deductible before any coverage kicks in), but the company would not share it with me. \u201cOver 26 million guests have had a safe and positive experience on Airbnb, including over 16 million in 2014 alone,\u201d Jakob Kerr, an Airbnb spokesman, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe respect our hosts\u2019 and guests\u2019 privacy and do not comment on questions like these.\u201d When I responded that disclosing the raw number of accidental deaths and injuries violates no one\u2019s privacy, he said he did not have anything to add.Mr. Wolf, the insurance executive, said that he budgeted for $2 million in liability claims each year on the 7,000 rentals he insured through the Assure product. If each of those is occupied 180 nights each year, that means $1 million in claims for every 630,000 nights of occupancy each year. Guests can feel good about those odds. Busy hosts might be less comfortable. Airbnb, with its 800,000 listings at any given time, has more to worry about.Everyday consumers who neither host nor stay at Airbnb units may think this has nothing to do with them. Chubb, however, sees it differently. If Airbnb succeeds in sharing risk with personal insurance companies, then everyone\u2019s premiums have to rise to cover it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t underwrite appropriately, it drives up prices for the average homeowner,\u201d said Christie Alderman, a vice president for Chubb Personal Insurance.Insurance companies could solve this by asking all policyholders about their hosting habits, but none of the 10 I contacted said that they had made any changes to their policies as home-renting has grown. They should ask.When a serious injury or death occurs at a host\u2019s home and the host\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy denies the claim because of the commercial activity the host was engaged in, will Airbnb be there when the lawsuits start flying? We\u2019re about to find out. And it will be a telling test of just how much the company has truly grown up.Elisa Cho contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Path to Zero Ebola Cases", "Date": "2014-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMONROVIA, Liberia \u2014 In my career as a medical doctor and global health policy maker, I have been in the middle of monumental struggles, including fights to make treatment accessible in the developing world for those living with H.I.V./AIDS as well as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. But the Ebola epidemic is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen.More than 11 months into the crisis, thousands of people are dead and more than 17,000 have been infected. The virus kills quickly, spreads fear even faster, alters human relationships, devastates economies and threatens to cruelly extinguish hope in three fragile countries that were on the rebound after years of misery. No other modern epidemic has been so destructive so fast.Recently, the regional response to the Ebola epidemic has been extremely effective in slowing its spread. Presidents Alpha Cond\u00e9 of Guinea, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone have shown strong resolve and determined political will in battling the virus. I recently spent two days in those countries and saw first-hand that the situation today is far better than it was a month ago because of national and international efforts.But we are not yet on the path to end the epidemic. These three countries and the world must now shift the focus of their strategy with one goal in mind: zero Ebola cases. While each country faces different challenges in reaching this destination, there are common principles that can guide them. Here are five steps the world must take together. First, we must find the resources required, no matter the cost, to get to zero cases as soon as possible. Any delay will dramatically increase the price in terms of both lives and money. For Senegal, the cost to treat one patient and track all of his contacts was more than $1 million. For Nigeria, one infected person led to 19 other cases, and more than 19,000 contacts traced by over 800 health care workers at a cost of more than $13 million. In Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, there are not one or 10 active transmission lines, but hundreds. Defeating Ebola now will cost billions \u2014 but it will spare the rest of the world from the spread of the virus, save lives in the countries, save money over the long term, and help the countries rebuild their economies.Second, it is time to multiply the number of trained people to hunt down the virus. Responders must track each contact of an infected person. Done right, this strategy will eventually extinguish all transmission lines, ending the epidemic. The focus of this vital activity must be on the intensity, quality and reach of tracking activities deep into the community. The communities need to be engaged, empowered and true partners in the drive to zero. It will also begin these countries\u2019 recovery process by providing work for potentially thousands of local people, and teach skills that are much needed to build effective community health care systems. Third, response coordination and support mechanisms must move down to the district level, with teams capable of collecting and analyzing data to further drive the intervention, as well as to scale up diagnostics and triage capabilities. We must especially focus on one particular piece of data: The percentage of new cases not on previous contact lists. In other words, did trackers previously identify the people who are newly infected as contacts of other cases, or do the new cases represent unidentified transmission lines? This will tell us whether we\u2019re winning or losing. Right now, in all three countries, we have only partial data on this particular indicator.Fourth, national response strategies must be nimble and adapt to local conditions, rather than be bound by prior commitments. Liberia, for instance, has had the most recent success in the fight against the virus and has seen a dramatic drop in reported cases. When I was in Liberia, they counted 150 active cases \u2014 the lowest number in several months. Now there is an opportunity to aggressively set in motion a contact tracing program to stop the lines of transmission, one by one until it\u2019s over.Finally, we must empower the strong leaders in the region who head the response to extinguish the virus wherever it exists. On the ground, there are talented national staff who have been tested on the frontline. There are also international partners: the United States and the United Kingdom, other countries, the United Nations, and international nongovernmental organizations, which have deployed massive resources in support of national efforts. Together, they have stood fast and slowed down this horrific epidemic. We must now give them the freedom and resources to end it. We have no choice but to beat Ebola. I return from West Africa admiring the leaders and the international responders. But we must also acknowledge that we have underestimated Ebola in the past and it\u2019s possible we could do so again. We must not forget we have one goal only: zero cases.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pony Express Blazes Another Trail ", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel13 PhotosSANTA BARBARA, Calif. \u2014 There are Mustangs stuck in my mind. There\u2019s the red \u201968 California Special coupe I saw parked at a neighbor\u2019s house every day as I walked by to La Cumbre Junior High School. It was too beautiful to touch.There was the blue \u201974 Mustang II fastback that my friend Gayle Van Leer drove when she wasn\u2019t atop actual thoroughbreds, training them to race. She was so self-confident and capable, she made that miserable car seem exciting.And there was the \u201994 GT that I piloted on the empty freeways on Christmas morning 1994 from Santa Barbara to my sister\u2019s house in San Diego, at speeds of which I am both proud and ashamed.Those Mustangs, and at least a dozen more, will be with me the rest of my life.Ford\u2019s pony car has been at the core of Americans\u2019 automotive enthusiasm for half a century. Of the cars that people dream of owning, it\u2019s one of the few they may actually afford. It\u2019s not pretentious like a Cadillac or Lincoln, nowhere near as impractical as a Corvette and not vulgar like a monster truck or a lowrider. And it sure isn\u2019t German, British, Italian, Korean or Japanese.But the Mustang is a car that has no practical reason to exist: It is about exuberance, freedom and fun. It is a particularly American vehicle engineered for the American pursuit of happiness.So when a new generation of Mustang arrives, the American automotive culture reorients itself. And this new 2015 Mustang is very new.The 2014 Mustang was the last rear-drive car sold in America that still had a solid rear axle \u2014 just like the Model T. The most significant mechanical change for the 2015 model is the adoption of an independent rear suspension across the Mustang range for the first time.The independent rear suspension is standard on every new Mustang from the base coupe, powered by a 300-horsepower 3.7-liter V6, to the new 310-horse EcoBoost version with a turbocharge 2.3-liter 4-cylinder, and on to the GT with a mighty 5-liter V8 rated at 435 horsepower. There\u2019s also a Shelby GT350 model coming in 2015, powered by a 5.2-liter V8 that will make more than 500 horsepower.I drove two preproduction fastback coupes: the EcoBoost with a 6-speed automatic transmission and a GT with the 6-speed manual. The base V6 engine essentially carries over from the 2014 model, and it\u2019s likely to still be the best seller.The 2015 car\u2019s 107.1-inch wheelbase hasn\u2019t changed from 2014, and at an overall length of 188.3 inches, the new car is actually two-tenths of an inch shorter in that dimension. But it is 1.5 inches wider than before, and the roof is 1.4 inches lower.With its long, flat hood, full fastback roof and lowered beltline, the proportions are more muscular than before. Yes, the Mustang styling cues are there \u2014 three-segment taillights, sculptured flanks, big grille opening and lots of running horse emblems \u2014 and yet it looks like a 21st-century athlete. It\u2019s not a nostalgia machine.The styling callbacks continue inside. As before, the dash is designed around separate hooded panels before the driver and passenger. Between them is the display screen for Ford\u2019s often frustrating Sync infotainment system. Above the screen are three large, effective circular vents that set a new standard for atmospheric control in a Mustang.While Ford\u2019s interior materials have improved, they still convey a sense of unpretentiousness \u2014 or chintz, take your pick. The seat leather is overprocessed, and the plastics are rigid and rough-grained. Toyota and Audi have nothing to fear in here.The eight airbags in the new Mustang, including a knee cushion embedded in the glove box door, double the number of airbags used before.It\u2019s the Mustang\u2019s structure that has vastly improved. Every body panel fits more precisely than before, and the doors shut with impressive thuds. The car is not roomy inside, and the back seat is still nigh on useless, but the driving position and visibility have both been improved.Press the Start button on the EcoBoost 4 and, well, nothing. There\u2019s no distinct exhaust note, and the engine idles quietly. Ford has incorporated a twin-scroll turbocharger and direct injection into this engine, but hasn\u2019t installed much of a personality. With a 0 to 60 time of 5.2 seconds, according to Car and Driver, it\u2019s a relatively quick car. It just doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s doing much when it\u2019s hooked to the automatic transmission.Arguing in favor of the EcoBoost engine are solid E.P.A. fuel-economy ratings: 21 miles per gallon in the city and 32 m.p.g. on the highway. The base V6\u2019s numbers of 19 city and 28 highway are behind that, but not so far back that the $1,570 premium Ford charges for the turbo EcoBoost makes strict economic sense.In contrast, the 5-liter V8 in the GT has an utterly theatrical character. It growls at idle and then rockets like an Allman Brothers guitar harmony as it hits its stride. Ripping through the manual transmission\u2019s gears is easy, and the chassis comes to life as the V8\u2019s 400 pound-feet of peak torque surges through it.The GT works as a solid piece with the optional Performance Package\u2019s 255/40YR19 front Pirelli tires biting in to turn the car and the tail\u2019s 275/40YR19 tires following in a neutral, easy arc as it corners. The suspension is adjustable, but it feels tenacious even when tuned to its softest setting. When set at its stiffest, the ride is always controlled and relatively comfortable.Every Mustang GT gets an electronic launch control program and, more playfully, a line lock system that will lock the front brakes so the driver can spin the rear tires in that most adolescent of automotive displays, a tire-frying burnout.The GT is a seriously quick and fast car: Car and Driver measuring a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.5 seconds and a quarter-mile performance of 13 seconds at 113 m.p.h. A governor restricts the car to a top speed of 164 m.p.h.There\u2019s still a lot of Mustang in how this new model feels \u2014 nervy and eager \u2014 but also the confidence of a big German coupe. And it\u2019s as satisfying to drive slowly as quickly.While a base Mustang V6 coupe starts at $23,600, getting into a GT will take at least $32,100. Most Mustangs will leave the dealer\u2019s corral with a sticker price of at least $30,000, and GTs, after options, will generally run past $40,000. Convertible models are $5,500 more expensive.Enthusiasm defines all the pursuits of happiness in American culture. The newspaper in your hands (or on your screen) is built around them \u2014 religion, arts, sports, business, politics, fashion, books, cooking \u2014 and the enthusiastic response to the new Mustang shows how vital the love of cars still is. Every car is a big financial commitment, and a car like the Mustang makes that commitment an easy one.To discuss cars solely as consumer products or a regulatory challenge is to miss their essence; the aspirations, hopes and freedom they embody. It\u2019s talking about cooking without considering flavor. It\u2019s arguing over politics without referencing principles. It\u2019s giving Yankees\u2019 scores without mentioning Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle or Jeter.By rational standards, the overpowered, overstyled and space-inefficient Mustang makes no sense. It doesn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s too American for that.A review last Sunday about the 2015 Ford Mustang GT misstated the speed rating of the Pirelli tires that come with the optional Performance Package. They are rated Y, not H.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "M.B.A. Programs Start to Follow Silicon Valley Into the Data Age", "Date": "2014-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreg Pass, the former chief technology officer of Twitter, put the matter succinctly. The M.B.A., he observed, is \u201ca challenged brand.\u201dThat\u2019s because the degree suggests a person steeped in finance and corporate strategy rather than in the digital-age arts of speed and constant experimentation \u2014 and in skills like A/B testing, rapid prototyping and data-driven decision making, the bread and butter of Silicon Valley.Those skills are not just for high-tech start-ups. They are required now in every industry. And leading business schools are struggling to keep pace.Business plan competitions have become common. Students\u2019 ideas usually have a digital component \u2014 websites, smartphone apps or sensor data \u2014 and prizes are up to $100,000 or more. Innovation and entrepreneurship centers have proliferated. Dual-degree programs, with a science or engineering degree added to an M.B.A., are increasing.Graduate business schools have picked up the digital ethos of experimentation and new ventures. At the Stanford Graduate School of Business, 150 elective courses are offered; 28 percent of those did not exist last year.\u201cWe\u2019re responding to the best practices we see in the outside world like A/B testing and working with massive data sets,\u201d said Garth Saloner, dean of the Stanford business school. \u201cWe\u2019re adapting.\u201dSo are the students. Once, students who had professional experience with computer programming were rare at business schools. Today, David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School, estimates that a third or more of the 900 students there have experience as programmers, and far more of them have undergraduate degrees in the so-called STEM disciplines \u2014 science, technology, engineering or mathematics. \u201cThere\u2019s been an extraordinary change in the talent pool,\u201d Mr. Yoffie said.Yet lately, many talented young people who might have gone to business school in the past are looking elsewhere. Applications to business graduate schools fell by 1 percent in 2013, the most recent statistics, reports the Council of Graduate Schools. By contrast, applications for computer science and mathematics graduate programs increased by 11 percent.Mr. Stayman describes the school\u2019s M.B.A. program in New York as a start-up of its own, unencumbered by tradition. \u201cOur starting assumption here is that a new kind of education is needed for managing in a digital economy, where speed and integration have to occur at a different level than in the industrial economy,\u201d he said.Cornell Tech, a partnership with Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, began with a relative handful of computer science students in 2013. The long-range goal of the new \u201capplied sciences\u201d school is to have 2,000 graduate students by 2043. But this is the first year for the M.B.A. program, in which 39 business graduate students share a third of their curriculum with 34 graduate students in computer science.Their joint work includes projects for New York businesses including banks, hedge funds, larger technology companies and start-ups. They work in small teams, and typically design and write software programs for the companies. The emphasis is on making things rather than planning.On Tuesday afternoons, the students gather for \u201cstudio\u201d sessions, where they sit in circles of chairs, give progress reports, discuss problems and get critiqued by faculty and outsiders. Until 2017, when it begins moving to its campus being built on Roosevelt Island, Cornell Tech resides in one of Google\u2019s buildings in downtown Manhattan.The aim of Cornell Tech is to train what its faculty calls \u201centrepreneurial, technology product managers,\u201d which are needed across industry as digital technology spreads.The students selected are not typical of M.B.A. classes. About 75 percent have STEM undergraduate degrees, Mr. Stayman said, while the comparable share is about one third at Cornell University\u2019s Johnson Graduate School of Management in Ithaca, N.Y.Amanda Emmanuel, 28, is fairly representative of the business students at Cornell Tech. At Carleton University in Canada, she majored in computing and design, and she had summer internships as a software engineer for General Dynamics. But she also started her own fashion business, which used her software algorithms to create figure-flattering clothing designs.Ms. Emmanuel came to Cornell Tech to burnish her business skills in a technology-rich environment. The Cornell program, which costs $93,000, lasts one year instead of the traditional two-year M.B.A. curriculum \u2014 another plus for Ms. Emmanuel.\u201cSaying you\u2019re going to be out for two years can be a big drawback,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the companies for the target jobs we\u2019re looking for didn\u2019t exist two years ago.\u201dMr. Pass holds the title of chief entrepreneurial officer at Cornell Tech, and he leads studio sessions, critiques projects and acts as a coach. At Twitter, Mr. Pass was part of a huge commercial success and, afterward, he says he felt \u201crealistic guilt,\u201d holding a winning ticket in the lottery of start-up capitalism.A graduate of Cornell, where he majored in computer science, Mr. Pass, 39, said he wanted to \u201cgive something back to the community.\u201d Something he figured he could provide was perspective, including his belief in the need for a \u201cbalanced culture,\u201d especially in tech companies and start-ups.Engineers may be the most valued asset in business today, but the engineering mentality has its weaknesses, Mr. Pass noted. Engineers, he said, tend to be problem solvers, one step at a time, solving the problem in front of them.\u201cBut the major business issue, especially for entrepreneurs, is often that problems are not known, need to be discovered or defined in a new way,\u201d Mr. Pass said. \u201cYou need a more integrated, broader view of things.\u201dThe M.B.A. program, he said, is trying to nurture people with those wider horizons, technical know-how and quick business reflexes \u2014 \u201ca new pivot on graduate education,\u201d as he put it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Of Kiwis and Currencies: How a 2% Inflation Target Became Global Economic Gospel", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicySometimes, decisions that shape the world\u2019s economic future are made with great pomp and gain widespread attention. Other times, they are made through a quick, unanimous vote by members of the New Zealand Parliament who were eager to get home for Christmas.That is what happened 25 years ago this Sunday, when New Zealand became the first country to set a formal target for how much prices should rise each year \u2014 zero to 2 percent in its initial action. The practice was so successful in making the high inflation of the 1970s and \u201980s a thing of the past that all of the world\u2019s most advanced nations have emulated it in one form or another. A 2 percent inflation target is now the norm across much of the world, having become virtually an economic religion.A core piece of the Japanese government\u2019s strategy to jolt its economy to life is to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to get to that magical 2 percent inflation level. In the United States, the same rationale has driven the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates near zero for six years and to pump nearly $4 trillion into the economy by buying bonds. The European Central Bank appears on the verge of its own huge effort to bring inflation closer to 2 percent.Yet even as the idea of a 2 percent target has become the orthodoxy, a worrying possibility is becoming clear: What if it\u2019s wrong? What if it is one of the reasons that the global economy has been locked in five years of slow growth?Some economists are beginning to consider the possibility that 2 percent inflation at all times leaves central banks with too little flexibility to adequately fight a deep economic malaise.To understand that thinking, it\u2019s worth understanding how New Zealand\u2019s 2 percent target became so entrenched in the world economic order to begin with. The story starts in that Southern Hemisphere nation in the summer of 1989, with a kiwi farmer and banker named Don Brash.When Mr. Brash stepped down as managing director of the New Zealand Kiwifruit Authority to lead the country\u2019s central bank in 1988, he was taking the helm of an economy that had been through a rough two decades, with high inflation and disappointing growth.Mr. Brash tells the story of an uncle who sold an apple orchard in 1971 and put the money into long-term government bonds to finance his retirement, only to see inflation wipe out 90 percent of his life savings by the time the bonds matured.In the years before Mr. Brash took the helm of the central bank \u2014 the Reserve Bank of New Zealand \u2014 his predecessor had made progress in bringing down inflation and making the bank more independent from the whims of politicians. But that independence had not been codified in law.That\u2019s what the Reserve Bank Act of 1989 was supposed to do. It directed the finance minister and the head of the central bank to arrive at a formal target for how high inflation should be, and granted the central bank political independence to guide interest rates to achieve that inflation level. The head of the central bank could be dismissed for failure to reach the inflation goal.For David Caygill, New Zealand\u2019s finance minister at the time, the essential part of the law was establishing the bank\u2019s independence from the political process. \u201cInflation targeting wasn\u2019t from our point of view the main point of the act,\u201d he said in an interview this month.The debate over the legislation was contentious. Labor unions feared that focusing so pointedly on inflation would lead to higher unemployment. Some business interests agreed. \u201cThis is wrong in principle, undemocratic and inflexible,\u201d the New Zealand Manufacturers\u2019 Federation said in a statement in July 1989.Mr. Brash wrote in his memoir that one prominent real estate developer \u201ccalled publicly for me to announce my body weight, so that he could work out how much rope would be needed to hang me from a lamppost in Lambton Quay,\u201d referring to the downtown area of Wellington, New Zealand\u2019s capital.Ultimately, however, the leaders of the majority party in Parliament decided to brush off the concerns. It helped the cause that one of the bill\u2019s strongest opponents was laid up in the hospital. And Christmas was around the corner.Once the law was enacted, though, there was the difficult question of what the inflation target should be. Zero percent? Two percent? Five percent?Mr. Brash and Mr. Caygill got a head start on an answer from an offhand comment made during a television interview in 1988. Roger Douglas, Mr. Caygill\u2019s predecessor as finance minister, had been seeking to dissuade New Zealanders from thinking that the central bank would be content with high inflation, and so he said in an interview that he was aiming for inflation of around zero to 1 percent.\u201cIt was almost a chance remark,\u201d Mr. Brash said in a recent interview. \u201cThe figure was plucked out of the air to influence the public\u2019s expectations.\u201dWith Mr. Douglas\u2019s figures as a starting point, Mr. Brash and Mr. Caygill agreed that it would be best to expand the range to give them more room to maneuver, but only a bit. New Zealand would aim for inflation between zero and 2 percent.Not surprisingly, the passage of a law to reform the central bank governance of an archipelago of 3.4 million people received no coverage in the major American papers. But across the close-knit world of global central bankers, people started to notice the Kiwis\u2019 monetary policy experiment.At the time, the idea of a central bank simply announcing how much inflation it was aiming for was an almost radical idea. After all, central bankers had long considered a certain man-behind-the-curtain mystique as one of their tools of power.The inflation goal may have reduced that mystique, but it created a kind of magic of its own. Merely by announcing its goals for inflation, and giving the central bank the independent authority to reach that goal, New Zealand made that result a reality. In negotiations over wages or making plans for price increases, businesses and labor unions across New Zealand started assuming that inflation would indeed be around 2 percent. It thus became self-fulfilling, with wages and prices rising more slowly.Inflation was 7.6 percent at the end of 1989 when the law was passed. By the end of 1991, it was 2 percent. Mr. Brash did a bit of a global campaigning, describing New Zealand\u2019s success to his fellow central bankers at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. \u2014 and to anyone else who would listen.One by one, more countries adopted the approach. Canada, grappling with persistently high inflation, set an inflation target of 2 percent in 1991. Countries including Sweden and Britain soon followed.Britain takes its 2 percent target seriously enough that the governor of the Bank of England has to write a letter to the chancellor of the Exchequer, explaining whenever inflation misses by more than a percentage point in either direction \u2014 the economic policy equivalent of a naughty student writing an apology on the blackboard.But the more that countries set about announcing a target, the more keen was the discussion about the actual number.One view was that zero inflation should be the goal \u2014 that a dollar today should have the same buying power as a dollar in a decade, or two or three. That was the view embraced by, among others, Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman. Alan Greenspan, Mr. Volcker\u2019s successor at the Fed, argued that inflation needed to be low enough that it didn\u2019t have to be factored into business decisions.Either of those approaches would imply that a proper target would be zero, or perhaps 0.5 percent or 1 percent, given the difficulty of measuring inflation precisely.But there was an alternate view \u2014 that keeping inflation that low might be dangerous. And the person mounting that argument most forcefully within the Federal Reserve in the 1990s was a Fed governor named Janet L. Yellen.Ms. Yellen, who now runs the institution, worried that announcing an inflation target would make the Fed focus only on inflation and neglect its responsibilities to bolster growth and jobs. She worried that zero inflation could paralyze the economy, particularly during slumps, and felt that some inflation was necessary.When businesses run into rough times, they may be inclined to cut workers\u2019 pay. But in practice, that doesn\u2019t happen much. Even in a severe downturn, businesses are more likely to cut hours, conduct layoffs or keep positions vacant than cut pay. That\u2019s one reason recessions tend to lead to higher unemployment instead of lower wages.Inflation helps deal with this problem. When there is a bit of inflation, employers can hold workers\u2019 pay steady during a downturn yet have it decline in inflation-adjusted terms. Inflation creates an adjustment mechanism: An assembly line worker may keep making exactly $20 an hour through a downturn, but in inflation-adjusted terms that pay falls by 2 percent a year, which could make the factory less likely to resort to layoffs.In that 1996 debate, another argument that Ms. Yellen raised against a zero percent target was particularly prescient. The higher the level of inflation, the more that central banks can stimulate the economy during a downturn.Imagine that there is a severe recession and the Fed cuts interest rates to zero, so that when you put money in the bank you get no return. If there is no inflation, your money will retain its purchasing power and be worth the same when you withdraw it. But if there is inflation, the value of your money sitting in the bank becomes steadily less valuable, meaning that you have more incentive to spend or invest it.\u201cA little inflation permits real interest rates to become negative on the rare occasions when required to counter a recession,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in 1996. \u201cThis could be important.\u201dShe, along with her colleagues across the world of central banking, had no idea just how important.Ms. Yellen\u2019s argument \u2014 that some inflation would help grease the economy\u2019s wheels and give central banks more flexibility to respond to a downturn \u2014 prevailed, in the sense that 2 percent became the widespread target of global central banks.But even as that target was embraced, signs started to emerge that it wasn\u2019t high enough to avoid the kinds of problems that Ms. Yellen and others had described.Starting in the late 1990s, Japan found itself stuck in a pattern of falling prices, or deflation, even after it cut interest rates all the way to zero. The United States suffered a mild recession in 2001, and the Fed cut interest rates to 1 percent to help spur a recovery. Then came the global financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, spurring a steep downturn across the planet and causing central banks to slash interest rates.All of this has quite a few smart economists wondering whether the central bankers got the target number wrong. If they had set it a bit higher, perhaps at 3 or 4 percent, they might have been better able to combat the Great Recession because they could cut inflation-adjusted interest rates by more.Mr. Blanchard offered no definitive answer, but others are more confident that 2 percent inflation has proved misguided.Such a shift would come at a cost. At 2 percent inflation, it is easy to enter into many financial transactions without really having to adjust for inflation. At 2 percent inflation, the value of a dollar falls by half over 35 years, whereas at 4 percent it falls in half every 18 years. On the other hand, inflation also hovered in the range of 3 to 4 percent through the mid-1980s, hardly remembered as an economic nightmare.A shift in the target, furthermore, could well cause disruptions in financial markets and potentially a sharp, sudden rise in longer-term interest rates that could slow growth.Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist and a former vice chairman of the Fed, saw it this way: \u201cCentral bankers have invested a lot and established a great deal of credibility on their 2 percent inflation target, and I think they\u2019re right to be very hesitant to give it up. If you change from 2 percent to 3 percent, how does the market know you won\u2019t change 3 to 4?\u201dBut that doesn\u2019t mean you wouldn\u2019t do something different, Mr. Blinder argued, if you could rerun the history of the last 25 years, from New Zealand\u2019s unusual experiment to the present, all while knowing what you know now.\u201cProbably in the abstract had they settled on a somewhat bigger number, that would have been a better choice,\u201d Mr. Blinder said. \u201cTo many academics that means that was a mistake so let\u2019s undo it and do it right. In the practical policy world that\u2019s not always right.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect figure for the effect of inflation on the value of money. At 4 percent inflation, the value of a dollar falls in half every 18 years, not every 16 years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin, Shunned by West, Visits India, a Friend Whose Interests May Lie Elsewhere ", "Date": "2014-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisNEW DELHI \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin flew into New Delhi on Wednesday in need of a friend.China is a friend, but a giant and possibly a threatening one, inclined to use Russia\u2019s vulnerabilities to its advantage. Japan was becoming friendlier, but it joined the West in its campaign of economic sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine, and a planned visit by Mr. Putin was scrapped in November. The same month, after being browbeaten over Ukraine at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Australia, Mr. Putin left before the event officially ended.India, however, is a warm and sentimental friend. Shared mistrust of the United States bound the two countries throughout the Cold War. As recently as July, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, reassured Mr. Putin that nothing had changed.\u201cAsk any child in India who is India\u2019s best friend internationally, and they will tell you that it is Russia,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Putin\u2019s 22-hour visit comes amid some uncertainty in the old relationship. The new decision makers in New Delhi say they are less interested in geopolitics than in jump-starting the economy as fast as possible. With its own economy swooning, Russia is unlikely to offer game-changing investment or trade agreements. And it is not the only world power vying for India\u2019s attention. China\u2019s president visited for two days in September, and President Obama will attend Republic Day celebrations in January.Russia has already begun to worry that it will lose its advantage as the dominant arms supplier to India, a point that was underlined recently when Moscow sent a Defense Ministry delegation to visit India\u2019s rival, Pakistan.In New Delhi, Mr. Modi and Mr. Putin will try to reinvigorate their countries\u2019 ties with a long list of possible projects, including deals to export Russian diamonds to India for polishing, build nuclear reactors in India, strike a long-term fixed-price oil contract and construct an oil and gas pipeline between the two nations.Over the long term, however, many of those around Mr. Modi have come to see the relationship with Russia as \u201cstagnant,\u201d said C. Raja Mohan, a policy analyst with the Observer Research Foundation, a policy research group based in New Delhi. \u201cThere are two or three generations of diplomats who have found Russia to be India\u2019s\u201d most loyal ally, he said. \u201cBut ask Modi\u2019s Gujarati friends, and they say, \u2018Where\u2019s the beef?\u2019 They are looking for business. There is no real business there.\u201dThe Russian and Indian leaders are said to get along well. Both grew up poor, and both arrived in their capitals as outsiders, suspicious of the entrenched elites surrounding them. Each projects self-discipline and toughness, which helped win the confidence of publics craving order and international standing.\u201cBoth are self-confident, a little bit assertive leaders, who are nationalist \u2014 let\u2019s not get that wrong,\u201d said Ajai Malhotra, who was India\u2019s ambassador to Russia until last year.Mr. Modi\u2019s team is said to be less reflexively pro-Russian than the administration it has replaced. Still when Mr. Modi took power in June, he stuck with the previous government\u2019s decision to refrain from criticizing Russia over Ukraine. That has sent an important message to Mr. Putin\u2019s domestic audience, allaying the fear that he has led Russia into overdependence on China.Indian statements on the conflict in Ukraine have been studiously neutral, and some officials have gone further, expressing support for Russia\u2019s view. In July, Western leaders excoriated Russia over the downing of a civilian aircraft over eastern Ukraine, suggesting that it was the work of separatists wielding a Russian-supplied missile. But India held back and was unwilling to join a campaign of economic sanctions.\u201cWe would never support sanctions against a country that has been friendly and supportive of us and whom we regard as a strategic partner,\u201d Mr. Malhotra said. Until the official inquiry into the cause of the crash is completed, he added, \u201call theories have to be considered conspiratorial.\u201dMuch of the discussion this week will center on the arms trade, where Russia faces rising competition. Russia\u2019s ambassador to India, Aleksandr Kadakin, told reporters in New Delhi that Russia was keenly aware that President Obama will be discussing many of the same issues when he visits in six weeks.In the five years ended in 2013, Russia accounted for 75 percent of India\u2019s arms imports, and the United States for only 7 percent, according to the Stockholm International Peace Resource Center. But the trajectory of Russia\u2019s sales is downward, and Indian officials have complained about cost overruns and equipment malfunctions.If Russia has an advantage in winning Indian business, it is that it is \u201cready to share extremely sensitive strategic technologies,\u201d said Pyotr Topychkanov, an associate in the nonproliferation program at the Carnegie Moscow Center. Though India may be interested in purchases from the United States and Israel, he said, \u201cno one from these countries is ready to codevelop nuclear submarines.\u201d That trust, he said, will become increasingly important as China builds up its military.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what the relations between Russia and China will be in 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, in the Asian region, we have only one trusted partner, which is India.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Grudgingly, Japanese Voters Appear Set to Stick With Abe", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANYO-ONODA, Japan \u2014 In the final stretch before parliamentary elections on Sunday that may determine the fate of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic program, this gritty industrial city on Japan\u2019s island-studded Inland Sea has been quiet.Nowhere to be seen this week were the squads of female campaign workers in brightly colored jackets who ordinarily before an election would be out by now, handing out fliers and waving at motorists. Missing, too, were the fleets of campaign cars bellowing their candidates\u2019 names via loudspeakers. In fact, the governing-party candidate is so strongly favored to win that he has rarely bothered visiting to woo voters.So far, the polls suggest his decision to hold the vote may well pay off in a big win for his governing party despite what many call tepid support. With just a few weeks to prepare for the sudden elections, the opposition Democrats have not been able to field enough candidates to win a majority, even if they won every contest.People on the streets of Sanyo-Onoda and neighboring communities in western Japan expressed deep dissatisfaction in recent days with Mr. Abe\u2019s economic policies, which they said was lifting the stock market but not the lot of average Japanese, whose real wages continue to decline. Still, when asked whether they would protest by voting for the opposition, most strongly shook their heads.\u201cThe economy is still terrible here,\u201d said Tatsuo Kametani, 62, a plumber in the nearby city of Mine. \u201cBut I\u2019m still for the Liberal Democrats. We gave the opposition a chance, and they blew it.\u201dThis is exactly the sentiment that analysts say Mr. Abe, who took office two years ago with promises of economic revival, is counting on. They contend that he made a cold political calculation that he could lock in four more years in power if he held the vote now, before opposition parties had time to regroup from their 2012 defeat. He may also be counting on voters\u2019 lack of interest, since a low turnout is expected to benefit the Liberal Democrats and their still formidable regional vote-gathering machines.According to some recent opinion polls, the party might even win two-thirds of the 475 seats in the powerful lower house, up from the 295 it held in the recently dissolved chamber. That would be enough to put Mr. Abe within reach of one of his long-held political goals: rewriting Japan\u2019s antiwar Constitution to allow a full-fledged military.Still, if the polls are accurate, the expected election blowout could prove a hollow victory. Voters, political analysts and even the candidates and their supporters agree that public support of the Liberal Democrats and Mr. Abe is lukewarm at best. They say a victory will not be an embrace of the Liberal Democrats so much as a continuing rejection of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan, which is seen by most voters as having badly bungled a stint in power a few years ago.\u201cThis will be a most tepid of landslide victories,\u201d said Kenichi Kawamura, the son of the Liberal Democratic candidate in the district that includes Sanyo-Onoda, who has done much of the campaigning for his father. \u201cThe public does not enthusiastically support the Liberal Democratic Party, but it does have a phobia of the opposition.\u201dIndeed, voters appear confused about what Mr. Abe is asking of them, analysts say. None of the opposition parties are against his call to postpone a planned, and highly unpopular, second increase of the national sales tax, making many Japanese wonder why the elections were even necessary.\u201cThere is nothing to debate,\u201d said Yoshiaki Kobayashi, a political scientist at Keio University in Tokyo. \u201cNo party is going to say they want a tax increase or a bad economy.\u201dTadashi Tomishige, 63, a restaurant owner in Sanyo-Onoda, who noted that the election would be costly, said, \u201cWhy do we need another election so soon? We all know who will win.\u201dAnalysts say Mr. Abe wants to extend his term to pursue noneconomic parts of his agenda that have proved even less popular with voters than his economic policies, including restarting the country\u2019s nuclear plants, expanding military cooperation with the United States and possibly changing the Constitution, something postwar Japan has never done. But Mr. Abe has shied away from these issues in the campaign, and the disorganized opposition has appeared unable to capitalize on them.In the district including Sanyo-Onoda, a six-hour bullet train ride from Tokyo, only two opposition parties were able to field candidates: the Democrats and the tiny Communist Party. Neither appears to pose much of a challenge to the incumbent, Takeo Kawamura, 72, a former education minister.Mr. Kawamura spent only four days in his district during the campaign. On a recent morning, his son, who is also his political heir apparent, made the rounds of traditional Liberal Democratic supporters riding in the back of an unmarked Prius.At every stop, the younger Mr. Kawamura, 38, got an earful of complaints, mostly about how Abenomics had failed to improve the still-depressed economy in the region\u2019s farming towns and smokestack cities.\u201cI have a lot that I want to say to the Liberal Democratic Party,\u201d said Akemi Tokunaga, the director of a nursing home where Mr. Kawamura asked for the support of deeply bowing employees. \u201cBut in the end, we have no choice. It is still better than the useless Democratic Party.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What People Buy Where", "Date": "2014-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionCONSPICUOUS consumption is everywhere, but it\u2019s not the same everywhere. People living in certain cities spend far more than the national average on particular goods and services that they believe will enhance their social standing. In New York City, favored items include luxury watches and shoes. In Boston, the status signal of choice is tuition to a private school. Clothes are the go-to goods in Dallas. Wearing high-end makeup says you\u2019ve arrived in Phoenix. In San Francisco, one telling sign is women\u2019s sport coats and tailored jackets. And in Washington, D.C., encyclopedias and reference books are top status markers. Go figure.I study urban economies for a living and what I found made me wonder if the different profiles cities present to the world have as much to do with their consumption patterns as with their local industries. To find out, I used the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Expenditure Survey to track differences among cities in household spending from 2007 to 2012. The survey dates to the 1800s but has only recently broken out detailed information on the spending habits, incomes and demographics of its respondents in the nation\u2019s metropolitan areas. With a collaborator, Hyojung Lee, a doctoral candidate in urban planning, I tracked differences in purchases of almost 1,000 items, from watches to loaves of bread \u2014 and even alimony. We divided this data into items that are conspicuously consumed, like cars, TVs, shoes and jewelry, and the more humdrum purchases of day-to-day life. Then we compared cities. It will not shock you to learn that if you live in one of the five boroughs of New York City or in Los Angeles, you spend more money on conspicuous goods, on average (both in absolute terms and as a share of total expenditures), than you do if you live in Boston or Phoenix. But it is revealing that you do this whether you are rich or poor or somewhere in between. The range of big spenders is also broader than you might expect. San Diego and Dallas outspend Boston and Phoenix on conspicuous consumption. The average household in Dallas will spend about 17 percent more \u2014 roughly $850 more per year \u2014 on status goods like watches, jewelry, high-end makeup and country-club memberships than a similar household in Boston. Crucially, people in different metropolitan areas also buy significantly different items. The average household in the nation spends approximately $5,000 per year on conspicuous items, but that spending is expressed in varying ways. In 2012 in Dallas, curtains, draperies, decorative pillows, lamps and floor coverings accounted, in part, for above-average conspicuous spending. In Boston, it was fancy wine in restaurants and bars. And in Phoenix, residents spend above the national average on their pets. In terms of pecking order, New Yorkers are tops when it comes to spending on status goods, followed by residents of Dallas, Los Angeles and San Diego. Even when we account for income, age and education levels, New Yorkers shell out 41 percent more \u2014 about $6,930 per year \u2014 than the national average. People who live in Boston, Phoenix and, perhaps surprisingly, Miami spend less on such goods.Bostonians spend more on college and private-school tuition, give more money to political and charitable institutions and consume more coffee and books. In Miami and Phoenix, spending on education is significantly less than the national average, but Miami residents are above average in giving away their money to schools. They also devote an extraordinary amount of cash to parking spaces and car leases. Residents in Boston and Miami are above-average spenders on vacation homes. Giving New York a run in the status sweepstakes is Dallas.These two cities may be winning the conspicuous consumption race because of the type of people who live in and around New York or Dallas, but this \u201cplace effect\u201d holds true no matter who you are, what you do or how much money you make. Just by virtue of living in a particular city, you tend to spend more or less on certain conspicuous items. Some of these distinctive consumption habits reflect culture and priorities. Besides watches and shoes, New Yorkers devote far more of their money to limos, taxis and street-vendor breakfasts than the national average. Sometimes they\u2019re just weird. People in San Diego spend 3.5 times more than everyone else on nonalcoholic beer. In San Francisco, alimony payments are the second biggest line item in total expenditures, 3.5 times the national average\u2019s share. Boston\u2019s most significant departure from the consumption norm is the rental of campers for out-of-town trips, 7.5 times the national average. The city, at 2.7 times the national average, also has an affection for dried peas.But consumption is not the exclusive hobby of the super wealthy. It transcends income, education and race. Place, meanwhile, not only influences how much of your income you spend on status goods. It also shapes your choices. What\u2019s the best way to signal status in a city like New York, which lacks a definitive car culture? The luxury watch. New Yorkers spend about seven times the national average on watches. No other major metropolitan area in the country comes close. In 2010, when the city was slowly recovering from the financial meltdown of 2007 and 2008, New Yorkers still spent more than 25 times the national average on watches. In many ways, geography is consumer destiny. Government data show distinct spending priorities, some rather mysterious, in the 18 metro areas that it tracks \u2014 regional personalities of conspicuous (and everyday) consumption.Women\u2019s clothes and shoes are another well-established marker of status, and people in New York and Dallas spend heavily accumulating them. New Yorkers spend 67 percent more on clothes, and 92 percent more on shoes, than the national average, while in Dallas, spending on clothes and shoes is 12 percent and 13 percent higher than average, respectively. Our research also overturns some long-cherished city stereotypes. Today, despite the city\u2019s gilded reputation, the average New York resident is not into joining exclusive social clubs; he or she spends 17 percent less than the national average on such memberships. Forget San Francisco\u2019s fame as a city of bohemians and egalitarians; it leads the nation in spending on social, health and country-club memberships.The biggest consumers of cosmetics and perfumes live in Los Angeles and New York, right? Not by a long shot. People in Phoenix, Houston, Minneapolis and Seattle spend 10 percent to 33 percent more than the national average catering to their physical appearance. But people in Boston and Baltimore have us all beat with their fondness for looking natural: They spend 25 percent less than the national average on superficiality.One last reputation spoiler: Residents in the publishing capital are not avid readers. New Yorkers spend 28 percent less than the national average on books and 2 percent less on newspapers and magazines. Residents of Seattle and San Francisco are the most prolific consumers of books; they spend one and a half times the national average. Bostonians get the prize for most informed, forking over 40 percent more than the national average for newspapers and magazines. Why are cities hotbeds of conspicuous consumption? There is no reason to believe that rural populations are less preoccupied with status, but cities are dense concentrations of people whose urban lifestyles make them \u2014 and their status \u2014 more visible to each other. Measuring what appear to be relatively insignificant spending choices in cities may illuminate cultural, political and social differences. If we self-select into certain cities and those cities then further influence and shape our priorities \u2014 or, for that matter, if a city\u2019s natives find themselves trying to keep up with the people moving in \u2014 we can expect increasing homogeneity within socio-geographical groups. This will not make us less polarized.If this keeps up, a resident of Miami may be less likely to find the surroundings of Boston congenial. It will no longer just be about fear of the weather or a distaste for dried peas. The geography of conspicuous consumption shows us who we are and who we are becoming.An associate professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Price School of Public Policy and the author of \u201cStarstruck: The Business of Celebrity.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Detroit by Air", "Date": "2014-12-06", "News": "\nPhotographs by Alex S. MacLeanYou can learn a lot about a place by seeing it from the air. I\u2019m a pilot and an aerial photographer; I am also trained as an architect. I\u2019ve always been interested in how the natural and constructed worlds work together, and sometimes collide. Issues like income inequality also reveal themselves quickly from above, and in Detroit and the surrounding area, the stark contrast between the haves and the have-nots couldn\u2019t be more apparent.Outside the city center, I flew over new homes built alongside lakes and country clubs. Five-car garages, swimming pools and pool houses decorated elaborately landscaped yards. However, once I crossed into the city limits, the urban fabric of Detroit looked like a moth-eaten blanket. Vast depopulated areas were filled with vacant lots and blocks of boarded-up and burned-out homes. This type of blight is visible in other American cities but few compare to the emptiness that surrounds Detroit\u2019s downtown.I first photographed Detroit from the air during the Reagan-Carter campaign 34 years ago. Housing abandonment was well underway. The city had lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs as the auto industry contracted and moved parts of its operations out of Detroit. \u201cWhite flight\u201d from the city, exacerbated by race riots in 1967, also contributed to severe depopulation of the area.  Meanwhile, the construction of highways allowed people to live farther away and commute to work, perpetuating the exodus to the suburbs. When I photographed the city in 2004, Detroit was still in decline. I could see from a plane even more abandoned and burned-out buildings, rubble and foundations poking out above the ground. The situation only worsened with the 2008 recession.From the air today, the decline appears to be slowing. The spaces once covered in rubble are cleared and mowed. Open green spaces, along with new community gardens and orchards, look almost bucolic against the downtown skyline. From my plane, I sense the potential for resurgence in these areas.  I can see how neighborhoods could become more walkable and support mixed-use development, with new shops, public transit and nearby parks and schools. However, this resurgence relies on a city that is stumbling out of bankruptcy. It also depends on an agency with the authority to consolidate abandoned lots for development and open spaces.I think that the inner ring of Detroit will win out in the long run, as cities are and will continue to be the greenest places  to live on a per-capita basis. This is made only more striking when I fly over the suburbs and see the inefficiency of single-family homes. They are dependent on cars, for one thing, and are connected by miles of paved roads to single-use zones of office and retail developments. These areas will not fare well, if we begin to mitigate climate change through measures like a carbon tax.Detroit\u2019s rebound is just a matter of time. Someday, I believe, it will be comparable to the once rundown sections of New York, Boston, Minneapolis and San Francisco, cities that are now thriving.\n\nPhotographs by Alex S.

{"Headline": "The Outlook on a Ukraine Stalemate", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 The \u201cday of silence\u201d observed this week by the Ukrainian Army and its pro-Russia rebel opponents was an event of enormous importance for global economics as well as geopolitics. The cease-fire\u2019s success confirmed that the truce agreed to on Sept. 5 is mostly holding, despite some localized fighting and the almost unanimous predictions of Western pundits that the war would quickly resume. The durability of the truce suggests that relations between Kiev and Moscow are gradually reverting toward an uneasy form of peaceful co-existence.If so, then last summer\u2019s civil war in Ukraine will probably evolve into a broadly stable \u201cfrozen conflict,\u201d similar to the stalemates that have prevailed for years or even decades in Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kosovo, Cyprus and Israel, to name just the ones closest to Europe. While nobody can be fully satisfied with this outcome, Ukraine, Russia and Europe should all heave sighs of relief, and so should anyone concerned about the outlook for the global economy. Let us begin with Ukraine. The loss of Crimea is irrelevant since much of the peninsula was already leased to Russia and was never part of Ukrainian territory until 1954. Losing the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine is more serious since it is one the country\u2019s main industrial regions, but normal economic relationships could soon be re-established because Russia needs to sell Donbass coal and steel as much as Ukraine needs to buy it. Since the profits from these activities were mostly misappropriated by corrupt officials and oligarchs, it will make no great difference to Ukraine if these profits are stolen by pro-Russia rebels instead. Meanwhile, Ukrainian national identity has been strengthened by the conflict. Although Ukraine is unlikely to ever be admitted to either the European Union or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, given the opposition in Germany and France as well as Russia, a European Union association agreement, similar to Turkey\u2019s, could help reduce corruption and encourage economic changes. Ultimately, a dual trading relationship with both Europe and Russia offers Ukraine the only possible route to economic viability. Such a relationship should become possible once this year\u2019s conflict is definitively \u201cfrozen.\u201dNow, consider Russia. Assuming that Kiev and the West reluctantly accept the status quo in Crimea and Donbass \u2014 and nobody seems to have any ideas about how to wrest these lands back from Russian control \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin seems unlikely to attempt any further territorial expansion, at least in the absence of some new geopolitical pretext. In that case, the European Union sanctions against Russia may well expire automatically in March and July, since they have been set for a one-year term, and a consensus to extend them will be hard to muster if the fighting in Ukraine has died down. Whether or not the sanctions are lifted, Russia is already undergoing an economic transformation. With oil prices and the ruble collapsing, Russia\u2019s political and business leaders are realizing that the post-Soviet economic model of full-scale financial liberalization and integration with the global economy has condemned them to over-dependence on energy exports and industrial imports from Western Europe.Partly as a result, Russia has succumbed to all the classic symptoms of the \u201cnatural resource curse, including an over-valued currency, deindustrialization, conspicuous consumption, excessive government spending, weak domestic tax collection and extreme vulnerability to international capital flows.Whatever happens in Ukraine, Russia is starting to restructure its economy. The classical free-trade model Russia adopted in the 1990s encouraged it to export raw materials and import industrial goods. The alternative development model, which Russia will now favor, is the one followed by other big emerging economies, including China, India and Brazil \u2014 and, before them South Korea and Japan. This Asian model will mean more protection for domestic industries, more control over international capital flows and less reliance on imports, even if that means lower quality and higher prices for Russian consumers. To the extent that Russia remains a big resource exporter, its trading and financial strategies, as well as its geopolitical alliances, will be redirected toward China and the rest of Asia. This strategic realignment by Russia will over time increase China\u2019s economic dominance in Asia. It may also strengthen the influence of China\u2019s authoritarian Confucian politics as a counterweight to the liberal democratic model promoted by the United States and the European Union, a philosophical shift that Mr. Putin will welcome. Finally, what about the implications of a frozen conflict for Europe and the world? The good news is that a definitive end to the fighting in Ukraine would remove the biggest single obstacle to economic recovery in Europe. The threat of all-out war in central Europe was probably the most important cause of last summer\u2019s sudden slump in the eurozone, especially in Germany \u2014 and if war were to break out again, the shock to business confidence would certainly overwhelm any stimulus efforts by the European Central Bank. The bad news is that a frozen conflict in Ukraine will weaken the postwar assumption that European borders cannot be changed by force. The fact is, however, that European borders have been violently redrawn throughout the past 25 years, following the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. And the principle of national sovereignty has been breached repeatedly, not least by the United States, Britain and France in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, as well as in Israel and Cyprus. Such breaches will doubtless continue from time to time, whether or not the sanctions against Russia continue. More worrying to the West than the diplomatic precedents set by a Ukrainian frozen conflict should be the global implications of Russia moving into the Chinese geopolitical and economic orbit. But given the intensity of Western interactions with China, peaceful coexistence and economic cooperation should also be possible with a Russia that decides to follow the Chinese models of economic management, business transparency and nondemocratic government.Advertisement"}

Among 20- to 49-year-old men in 2013, 56 percent of professional, managerial and technical workers were married, compared with 31 percent of service workers, according to the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau. Some people argue that the gap is largely a result of a decline in traditional values among working-class men, particularly whites who constitute the majority of them. Supposedly they are not as industrious in seeking employment as were their fathers and grandfathers and so fail to secure the steady jobs needed for marriage. But some digging into historical census records shows that social class differences in marriage have been tied to the extent of income inequality among white Americans for at least 130 years. They also suggest that commentators who insist that the marriage gap is wholly a matter of values are almost surely wrong.Census records, which have been compiled into the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series by demographers at the University of Minnesota, tell us that the current era is not the first time that the nation has experienced a large marriage gap; it is at least the second. Another instance occurred in the late 19th century. What these two eras have in common, according to the economists Claudia Goldin, Lawrence F. Katz and Robert A. Margo, is that economic inequality was high and rising during both of them. The first marriage gap occurred between 1880 and 1910, during a period that Mark Twain labeled the Gilded Age. The growing industrial economy increased the number of managers and executives. The extension of schooling increased the demand for teachers. And the quadrupling of newspaper circulation between 1880 and 1900 increased the demand for editors and reporters. A white-collar professional class solidified its gains in the labor market and married in large numbers. At the same time, the fortunes of independent craftsmen and artisans declined as their small shops were replaced by large factories. Younger men who would have found positions as skilled apprentices and journeymen instead became low-paid industrial or service workers, and their marriage rates were modest. In the past few decades, a period that some are calling the New Gilded Age, inequality has been high and rising again. Workers with bachelor\u2019s degrees have seen their earnings far outpace those with less education. The middle of the labor market has hollowed out because of technological change. The offshoring of production has closed factory after factory. At the bottom, low-skilled service work has expanded, while at the top, an elite has captured an increasing share of income gains.Not coincidentally, we see high levels of marriage among young professionals today, although they may delay weddings until they have started a career. College-educated men and women are the privileged players in our transformed economy: They can pool two incomes and provide a solid financial foundation for a marriage. In contrast, we have seen declines in marriage among high school graduates who are stuck in the middle of the labor market, where they can no longer find the kind of steady, decently paying employment that supported their grandparents\u2019 marriages. What the census data demonstrate, then, is a strong association between the level of economic inequality and the level of marriage inequality. Since 1880, the marriage gap and the earnings gap have been correlated. In periods when wages were more unequal, so were marriage rates. When inequality was low and stable during the prosperous post-World War II years, marriage rates were more similar and the proportions of married people reached historic high points for all groups. To be sure, the parallel movements of economic inequality and marriage inequality do not prove that the former causes the latter. But it is hard to look at the census figures and conclude that the state of the labor market has had nothing to do with the marriage gap among the middle class, the working class and the poor. Certainly, no one would argue that the large marriage gap during the first Gilded Age was caused by the reluctance of men to work hard. On the contrary, they labored long hours for wages so low that families were often able to subsist only by sending sons out to sell newspapers or having their daughters work as servants in other families\u2019 homes.Moreover, the government social welfare programs that are often blamed for creating dependency among the poor, such as cash assistance for single parents, unemployment benefits and food stamps, did not start until the 1930s and therefore cannot be blamed for a marriage gap that existed a half-century earlier. Yet, even if it has not been the major determinant of class differences in who marries, cultural change has been a factor in what unmarried people are doing. Single men and women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries rarely lived together without marrying, and very few had children. The social norms against cohabitation and childbearing outside of marriage were strong. During the past few generations, these norms have weakened. It is now commonplace for unmarried young adults to cohabit and broadly acceptable for them to have children. Unlike their ancestors in the late 1800s, many of today\u2019s working-class young adults have responded to the difficulty of marrying by living with a partner and having children outside of marriage. We would not be seeing these trends if social norms about family formation had remained unchanged \u2014 even given the recent rise in income inequality. Certainly, then, cultural change is part of the story of the marriage gap we see today. But the idea that young men without college degrees aren\u2019t marrying because they\u2019ve turned into couch potatoes is simplistic. What\u2019s happened is that the kinds of jobs that would get them off the couch have become scarce in our unequal economy.Advertisement"}

Su descripci\u00f3n del oneroso y costoso mecanismo para llevar la leche de las vacas hasta la mesa familiar era una historia ya conocida para los cubanos, quienes han sido sometidos por d\u00e9cadas a una econom\u00eda centralizada, que se encuentra entre las m\u00e1s disfuncionales y an\u00f3malas del mundo. Pronto se hizo evidente que la inesperada franqueza de Castro ese d\u00eda representaba el inicio de una era de transformaci\u00f3n para la econom\u00eda de la isla.Luego de que Fidel Castro cediera el poder a su hermano en 2008, el Gobierno cubano inici\u00f3 una serie de reformas que han permitido que sus ciudadanos comiencen a crear formas de sustento que no est\u00e1n completamente sujetas al control del Estado. El ritmo ha sido vacilante, con mucho retroceso propiciado por la antigua guardia del Gobierno, que considera una mayor liberalizaci\u00f3n de la econom\u00eda como un repudio del sistema socialista que Fidel Castro hizo sacrosanto.El inminente final de la era de los Castro \u2014Ra\u00fal Castro, de 83 a\u00f1os, ha dicho que dejar\u00e1 el cargo en 2018\u2014 coincide con un intenso debate sobre el futuro de la econom\u00eda del pa\u00eds.Hasta ahora, la administraci\u00f3n Obama ha observado las reformas con escepticismo. La Casa Blanca ha flexibilizado las restricciones de viaje a la isla y de remesas, pero ha hecho relativamente poco para empezar a levantar la red de sanciones que Estados Unidos ha impuesto a Cuba durante d\u00e9cadas.El presidente Obama podr\u00eda ayudar a expandir el papel de la peque\u00f1a pero creciente clase empresarial al flexibilizar sanciones mediante pasos que puede tomar unilateralmente la rama ejecutiva. Tambi\u00e9n puede colaborar con el creciente n\u00famero de legisladores que apoyan la expansi\u00f3n de relaciones comerciales con Cuba. La Casa Blanca podr\u00eda iniciar el proceso eliminando a Cuba de la lista del Departamento de Estado de pa\u00edses que respaldan a organizaciones terroristas. Tambi\u00e9n es posible ampliar los mecanismos mediante los cuales los estadounidenses pueden proveer capital a las empresas independientes.Hacer eso empoderar\u00eda a los cubanoamericanos que desean desempe\u00f1ar un papel m\u00e1s robusto en la transformaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica de la isla. Adem\u00e1s, gradualmente, disminuir\u00eda la habilidad del Gobierno cubano de culpar a Washington por las deficiencias de una econom\u00eda que est\u00e1 fallando a sus ciudadanos, principalmente como resultado de las pol\u00edticas estatales.Antes de que Fidel Castro asumiera el poder en 1959, la econom\u00eda de Cuba estaba dominada por su relaci\u00f3n con Estados Unidos, entonces el m\u00e1s importante importador del principal producto cubano, az\u00facar. Los turistas estadounidenses viajaban a la isla por montones, atra\u00eddos por su proximidad, clima tropical y deleitante vida nocturna.Luego del derrocamiento de Fulgencio Batista, un l\u00edder autoritario que hab\u00eda protegido los intereses comerciales estadounidenses, el Gobierno de Fidel Castro afianz\u00f3 el control sobre, pr\u00e1cticamente, todo segmento de la econom\u00eda. Decomis\u00f3 tierra y propiedades de empresas estadounidenses y prometi\u00f3 garantizar vivienda, atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica y educaci\u00f3n a todos los ciudadanos. El sistema comunista gener\u00f3 una econom\u00eda retr\u00f3grada y l\u00e1nguida, respaldada ampliamente por Mosc\u00fa. Pero luego del colapso de la Uni\u00f3n Sovi\u00e9tica en 1991, la econom\u00eda cubana se desplom\u00f3.Los cubanos llaman de manera eufem\u00edstica a la austera privaci\u00f3n de los a\u00f1os 90 el \u201cperiodo especial\u201d, una \u00e9poca en que el Gobierno cubano fue forzado a permitir cierta inversi\u00f3n extranjera y autorizar, de manera limitada, el empleo por cuenta propia. En 1999, la Habana encontr\u00f3 un nuevo benefactor en el reci\u00e9n elegido presidente de Venezuela, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, cuyo apoyo hizo posible que las autoridades cubanas apretaran el control estatal de la econom\u00eda.Pero en los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os, Venezuela, que provee petr\u00f3leo ampliamente subvencionado a Cuba a cambio de servicios m\u00e9dicos, lidia con una crisis pol\u00edtica y econ\u00f3mica que empeora, y que podr\u00eda forzar la eliminaci\u00f3n de subvenciones a La Habana.La precariedad de esa relaci\u00f3n le ha dado m\u00e1s urgencia al debate sobre cu\u00e1n r\u00e1pido el Gobierno cubano necesita implementar las reformas que respald\u00f3 Ra\u00fal Castro. Los l\u00edderes de la antigua guardia advierten que una econom\u00eda de mercado liberalizada podr\u00eda convertir a Cuba en una sociedad menos igualitaria y proveer\u00eda una apertura a que Estados Unidos desestabilice al gobierno mediante una inundaci\u00f3n de inversi\u00f3n privada. Los reformistas, incluidos algunos de los economistas m\u00e1s respetados del pa\u00eds, argumentan que el estado actual de la econom\u00eda es insostenible.La realidad es que los logros en la previsi\u00f3n social de la isla no pueden sustentarse si se mantienen las tendencias econ\u00f3micas y demogr\u00e1ficas actuales. Cuba, Argentina y Chile son los \u00fanicos pa\u00edses de Latinoam\u00e9rica y el Caribe actualmente clasificados en el rango superior del \u00cdndice de Desarrollo Humano de las Naciones Unidas, una medici\u00f3n del nivel educativo, expectativa de vida, entre otros indicadores, de un pa\u00eds.El salario promedio en Cuba, en la actualidad, equivale a aproximadamente el 28% del valor adquisitivo antes del colapso de la Uni\u00f3n Sovi\u00e9tica, seg\u00fan el Centro de Estudios de la Econom\u00eda Cubana, una entidad estatal adscrita a la Universidad de la Habana. La devaluaci\u00f3n ha causado hurtos descontrolados en los centros laborales. Tambi\u00e9n ha incentivado a miles de profesionales cubanos que han emigrado a Estados Unidos y Latinoam\u00e9rica en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os en busca de una vida mejor. La tasa de natalidad del pa\u00eds ha descendido, a la vez que los ciudadanos en edad avanzada viven m\u00e1s tiempo.El sector agr\u00edcola sigue obstaculizado por tecnolog\u00eda desactualizada y pol\u00edticas bizantinas. Una ley para atraer inversi\u00f3n extranjera que la Asamblea Nacional de Cuba aprob\u00f3 en marzo, a\u00fan no produce un solo acuerdo. Y, para aumentar los desaf\u00edos, el Gobierno cubano ha prometido eliminar pr\u00f3ximamente su sistema de doble divisa, un proceso que podr\u00eda generar inflaci\u00f3n. El sistema dual, que incluye un peso ajustado al d\u00f3lar, se estableci\u00f3 en los a\u00f1os 90, cuando se abri\u00f3 el turismo.A pesar del estancamiento econ\u00f3mico, hay que destacar el crecimiento de una nueva clase de empleados del sector privado, actualmente casi 500,000. Aunque no es una cifra enorme en una naci\u00f3n de 11 millones de habitantes, constituye una clase sorprendentemente ingeniosa en un pa\u00eds donde administrar un restaurante privado exige adquirir pr\u00e1cticamente todos los ingredientes en el mercado negro. Un producto tan b\u00e1sico como la papa tiene que adquirirse como contrabando en Cuba.Muchos de los que han establecido negocios, tales como posadas, son cubanos que regresaron con ahorros obtenidos en el extranjero y aquellos con parientes que aportaron el capital inicial. Todos luchan con la burocracia ante la imposibilidad de importar legalmente productos tan b\u00e1sicos como colchones y almohadas. Traer art\u00edculos de Estados Unidos es costoso y complicado, como consecuencia de las sanciones estadounidenses.Las autoridades cubanas parecen tener una actitud inconstante respecto al creciente sector privado. Aunque dan la bienvenida al empleo y a la ganancia tributaria que genera, los bur\u00f3cratas est\u00e1n poni\u00e9ndoles trabas a los negocios particularmente exitosos, y obligando algunos a convertirse en cooperativas administradas conjuntamente con el Estado. El mensaje parece ser: queremos prosperidad pero no personas m\u00e1s pr\u00f3speras que otras.Washington podr\u00eda empoderar el campo reformista al facilitar que los empresarios cubanos obtengan financiamiento externo y formaci\u00f3n empresarial. Es poco probable que esa estrategia sea exitosa, a menos que Estados Unidos abandone su pol\u00edtica de cambio de r\u00e9gimen. A pesar de que la transformaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica de Cuba est\u00e1 avanzando lentamente, bien podr\u00eda conducir a una sociedad m\u00e1s abierta.

{"Headline": "Shifting Dynamics for Cuba\u2019s Dissidents ", "Date": "2014-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe words were scrawled in graffiti on a street near the house of the Cuban dissident Oswaldo Pay\u00e1 a few years before his suspicious death in 2012. \u201cIn a plaza under siege, dissidence is treasonous.\u201dOver the decades, Cuba\u2019s authoritarian government has relied on that convenient argument to exert pervasive control over the lives of its citizens and keep opposition movements from gaining enough traction to threaten the state. The message was unmistakable: As long as the United States was intent on toppling the island\u2019s leaders and meddling in the country\u2019s affairs, Cubans, as a matter of national sovereignty, had to close ranks. The era that began this month when President Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba announced an end to more than 50 years of enmity between their governments is a watershed moment for Cuba\u2019s diverse and courageous opposition movement.In 1998, at the end of a decade of hunger and deprivation triggered by the collapse of Havana\u2019s longtime patron, the Soviet Union, Mr. Pay\u00e1 undertook an audacious mission. Relying on a Cuban law that ostensibly allowed groups of 10,000 or more eligible voters to propose new laws, Mr. Pay\u00e1 gathered, by some estimates, more than 25,000 signatures from Cubans who endorsed sweeping democratic reforms, including free elections, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press and a less-regulated economy.Mr. Ferrer says his goal is not the type of sudden, dramatic overthrow of the Castro government that many Cuban exiles have historically favored. Rather, he said, Cuba\u2019s opposition movement must become sufficiently empowered to get a seat at the table.\u201cWe need to become large enough to force the regime to negotiate,\u201d Mr. Ferrer said, acknowledging that it will take time to get enough Cubans to believe that siding with the opposition is worth the risks. \u201cNo one wants to bet on the horse that\u2019s losing the race.\u201dDespite decades of economic deprivation and government oppression, the vast majority of Cubans have been unwilling to join, or openly support, opposition movements. It is easy to understand why. Cuba\u2019s shrewd intelligence service has managed to penetrate those movements over the years and make it hard for opposition leaders to join forces. And it has effectively cast dissidents as greedy agents of Western plots in a deeply nationalistic nation that for many years was, in fact, the target of covert American plots.While the tactics used against dissidents are not nearly as brutal as they were a decade ago, they remain insidious. Prominent opposition leaders are attacked by the official media. Activists are often detained temporarily to keep them from attending meetings and to remind them \u2014 and their neighbors \u2014 that they are being watched. State surveillance is widely assumed to be so pervasive that diplomats blast music whenever they want to have a conversation about sensitive issues. Wary Cubans pop out the batteries of their cellphones if they want to speak privately, fearing that the state\u2019s extensive army of domestic spies can listen in on virtually anyone at any time.On a very basic level, said Elizardo S\u00e1nchez, who is known as the dean of Cuba\u2019s human rights activists, political activism requires a level of zeal that many Cubans lack. \u201cLife is so hard that people don\u2019t have time to think in political terms,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything from finding food, transportation and medicine takes so much time.\u201dWhether Cuba\u2019s opposition movement will be empowered by the thaw in relations with the United States or suffer intensified repression will depend largely on the support activists receive from the international community. As Cuba becomes more accessible to Americans, including Cubans who are dual citizens, the government in Havana, feeling vulnerable in the face of a flood of investment, increased travel and a less-regulated flow of information, may well seek to redouble its efforts to stifle dissent.If Cuban dissidents and civil society leaders are allowed to participate in the summit meeting, as Washington has advocated, Ms. Rousseff may well be speaking to the future leaders of a democratic Cuba.Leer en espa\u00f1ol (Read in Spanish) \u00bbAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some of the Rich Collect Art. Others Collect Passports.", "Date": "2014-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside WealthAlong with stock and real estate portfolios, the global rich are now buying a new form of economic security: passport portfolios.Wealthy investors from around the world are increasingly shopping for visas or citizenship in other countries, hoping for a personal hedge against their own volatile governments or economies. A vast majority are new millionaires and billionaires from emerging-market countries, especially China, Russia and nations in the Middle East. Often, they\u2019re shopping for passports or entree into Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia.Experts estimate that these \u201ceconomic citizens\u201d are spending $2 billion a year on second or third passports and visas. Demand is so strong that governments around the world have started an arms race of sorts for V.I.P. visas, offering ever-faster residencies and passports for ever-higher prices. Over the past year, Australia, Canada, Britain and several other European countries have raised the prices or investment requirements of their so-called golden visas and created a new fast lane for citizenship. Opponents, however, say the programs have a downside. Some say they have the potential to offer safe harbor to people who made their fortune through corruption or illegal activities.Others say that at a time when immigration and inequality are heated political topics, V.I.P. visas amount to selling citizenship to the rich without bringing many broader benefits to the host country. Last year, Viviane Reding, then the European Commission\u2019s vice president for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship, put it more bluntly in a speech, saying, \u201cCitizenship must not be up for sale.\u201dEven as criticism mounts, however, governments are cashing in. One of the biggest winners is Malta. In January, this island nation of about 425,000 people started selling citizenship for a fee of 650,000 euros (more than $800,000) with no residency requirements. Because Malta is a European Union member, citizenship also gives holders the ability to travel and settle within the European Union\u2019s 28 countries.After the plan drew protests, the government added new requirements, including a demand that applicants spend at least \u20ac350,000 on real estate and \u20ac150,000 on government bonds. In the first six months, more than 200 investors signed up, earning the government $200 million, according to Mr. Kalin, who helped design the plan. He said the government carefully screens each applicant for financial irregularities. \u201cIf you have a high-quality program,\u201d he said, \u201cyou attract the right kind of people.\u201dElsewhere, Australia recently announced plans for a Premium Investor visa, nicknamed the platinum visa. That nation already has a golden visa, called the Significant Investor visa, which offers permanent residency after four years in exchange for an investment of 5 million Australian dollars ($4.15 million). More than 436 visas have been granted under the program, bringing in more than 2 billion Australian dollars in investments. The new program will give faster residency (in just 12 months) in return for 15 million Australian dollars in investments.In response to criticism that the investments were being parked in government bonds, rather than more directly helping the economy, Australia may now require investors to put the money into venture capital, infrastructure or agriculture projects.Consultants, lawyers and advisers to the wealthy say golden visas bring many benefits to host countries. Rich immigrants invest in new companies, buy new homes and spend on almost everything from restaurants and private schools to personal staffs.But critics like Mr. Metcalf argue that in Britain, at least, the benefits are often offset by the overseas rich bidding up prices for luxury real estate and services. And, he contends, because most of the investments go into government bonds that pay interest, \u201cwe are essentially paying oligarchs to come to the U.K.\u201d In Britain, an investor visa program gives residency for 2 million pounds ($3.14 million); applicants are eligible for \u201cindefinite leave to remain\u201d after five years. But the government recently added fast-track programs for people who invest \u00a35 million (requiring a wait of only three years) and \u00a310 million (a wait of two years). Half of the visas go to Russians and Chinese. Mr. Metcalf argues that visas, if sold at all, should be offered through a formal auction, with proceeds going to a national education program. While he acknowledges that an auction may seem crass, he argues that it beats the current system.\u201cLet\u2019s find out what the optimal price really is,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Well, you\u2019re selling citizenship.\u2019 We\u2019re not selling citizenship; we\u2019re selling settlement. And right now, we\u2019re practically giving it away.\u201dIn the United States, the investor-visa program called EB-5 has been so popular that it has hit its cap of 10,000 visas this year, for the first time since 1990. The program awards visas to foreigners willing to invest at least $500,000 in approved projects. An investor who can show that a project creates or preserves at least 10 jobs can get a green card and eventual citizenship. More than 80 percent of the applications are from Chinese investors.The program has come under fire for failed projects and lack of oversight. Yet because its renewal is tied to broader immigration policies, experts say it\u2019s unclear how or when it might be changed. At the very least, experts say the investment level of $500,000 \u2014 set in 1990 \u2014 should be raised to reflect the new economics of V.I.P. visas.ROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Caving In to China's Power", "Date": "2014-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTen years ago I wrote a book called \u201cThat\u2019s China.\u201d It told the story of how the magazine publishing business that I built in China, fighting all the way, mostly with the government bureaus that controlled media, was taken from me by the government, destroying my career. The publishers of the book were excited about the project. We knew the story would upset powerful people in China. \u201cWe love controversy,\u201d they said. \u201cThat\u2019s what publishing is all about.\u201d At the last minute the publishers sent a review copy to their representative office in Beijing, whose response was: \u201cWe will never be able to develop business in China if you publish this.\u201dThe publication was canceled. My editor admitted in private that they were afraid.I was familiar with the power of the Chinese government. I had dealt with censors \u2014 \u201ccontent inspectors,\u201d as they preferred to be known \u2014 on a daily basis, face to face. I had listened to them explain: \u201cWe like a controversy. We love an argument. But we can\u2019t let your readers have one, especially if they are Chinese.\u201dFrom time to time I did upset the censors. I was accused of supporting independence for Taiwan, interfering in the Tibet question, encouraging Falun Gong, the religious sect, selling sexual services, pornography and, ultimately, Muslim separatism. Yet every time I got into trouble, it was not because the censors themselves had read and found something upsetting. It was because my commercial rivals had found it for them. Censorship was a commercial tool, a weapon in your business arsenal. You used it to hurt people. My magazines lost thousands of dollars in revenue thanks to the \u201csexual services\u201d complaint, which was directed at our personal classified advertising. The competitor behind that attack went on to launch its own classifieds section, which ran pages of massage service advertisements offering \u201chappy endings.\u201d Today, many of the same political and corporate leaders who complain about Chinese censorship and its harsh consequences \u2014 like the detention of writers such as the Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo \u2014 quietly accept the censorship of the Chinese Communist Party themselves. Some even self-censor, in order not to upset the party or even, much worse, to avoid damaging their prospects of making money in China.The South Africans denied the Dalai Lama a visa. The 2012 London Book Fair allowed the Chinese General Administration of Press and Publication (my old adversary) to dictate the guest list, and to bar another Chinese Nobel Prize winner, Gao Xingjian, who lives in exile in France. In November, top executives from international tech firms including Facebook, LinkedIn and Apple attended the inaugural World Internet Conference in Zhejiang Province. Access to many of the attendees\u2019 sites and services is blocked in China, but none of them publicly raised the matter with the host, a state agency, despite the opportunity. Nor did any of them comment on the irony, at least in public. In March, Reader\u2019s Digest made cuts to a publication being printed in China, at the request of the printer. In the same month the chairman of Bloomberg publicly questioned whether his organization should have \u201crethought\u201d its coverage of politically sensitive news in China.The world is falling over itself to please the Chinese Communist Party. We call it China, but that is a flag of convenience, a banana leaf to cover our embarrassment.One of the Communist Party\u2019s outstanding feats, one of its greatest successes, is the creation of an intangible, terrifying impression of a vast invisible force, a monster in the next room. It has no name, no identity. It is the spirit of the party, the ghosts of the \u201cRevolutionary Martyrs.\u201d Even the leaders themselves are afraid of it. If you cannot give something a name, you cannot speak to it or reason with it. All you can do is fear it. The system thrives on fear. Yet the party is itself very afraid \u2014 of the people. Hence the censorship and punishment of those who dare to speak out.Now the party\u2019s monster is striking fear into the Western world. It controls the only hope, as the leaders of the West would have it, for the world economy. It must be appeased. Yet leaders of Western governments and major corporations rail against the censorship, the repression of writers and thinkers and human rights. Such double standards delight the Chinese Communist Party. It has co-opted the West into playing by its own rules, where hypocrisy is Rule No.1, where everyone is guilty to some extent and can be held to account at the convenience of whoever is in charge. And the world is putting China in charge. It is a very old and very clever Chinese political maneuver. To the party, Chinese supremacy is only natural, a reversion to how things should always have been, if not for the Industrial Revolution and a few other blips in world history. China is the rightful leader of the civilized world.As did the suzerain states that surrounded it centuries ago, the world again sends tribute in the hope that China will treat it with favor, and the party takes that as confirmation of its elevated position, takes the tribute for granted and sees the donor as weak, while the foreign government or corporation congratulates itself on being promised access to the Chinese market, or Chinese investment in its country or companies. They forget, or ignore the fact, that the Chinese market is for the Chinese, and so are the profits. At the APEC conference in Beijing in early November, China censorship, how it works, how it should be stood up to, and how Western governments could deal with it came together in one brief moment at the final press conference. A New York Times journalist asked President Xi Jinping about the issuing of China visas for foreign correspondents. The New York Times has had difficulty getting visas since it ran a story about the private wealth of senior party members, the same topic Bloomberg wanted to rethink. Mr. Xi all but ignored the question. President Obama, standing to one side, turned to the media, raised his eyebrows, smiled and shrugged.Let\u2019s hope that was a shrugging off, and not a gesture of acceptance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Week of Facts vs. Interpretation ", "Date": "2014-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryThere are no facts, only interpretations, Nietzsche said, and there was good evidence of that this past week in the decision of a grand jury on Staten Island, and in President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s take on Russia\u2019s economic plight. The video of Officer Daniel Pantaleo restraining Eric Garner with a chokehold, and the black man gasping \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d provided what most people would accept as a clear record of what happened from beginning to end. There were none of the unknowns and ambiguities that apparently persuaded grand jurors in Missouri not to bring charges against the officer who shot Michael Brown dead in Ferguson, a case with no video.No doubt Mr. Pantaleo did not intend to kill \u2014 and it may well be that Officer Darren Wilson felt his life really was in danger when he shot Mr. Brown. But grand juries do not rule on guilt or innocence, or on intentions or remorse; only on whether there\u2019s enough evidence to try a case. And if the evidence in Ferguson could possibly be deemed insufficient, the video on Staten Island seemed to be about as clear as evidence gets.On the streets of New York, Ferguson and other American places, for many people there was only one interpretation of what happened to Mr. Garner, Mr. Brown, the 12-year-old shot in Cleveland for brandishing a toy gun and the many other black boys and men who are victims of excessive force at the hands of the police: Law enforcement in the United States is racially skewed, and black lives do not carry the same weight as white lives. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and hands raised in surrender have become the new raised fist, a protest against a problem of which the actions of some cops or grand juries are only a symptom. Putin and His EconomyThe facts in Russia are not only clear, but clearly dismal. The Ukrainian standoff is going nowhere, and Western sanctions are hurting. The government acknowledged this week that the economy was headed for recession. On Monday the ruble suffered its worst one-day drop since 1998, and has now lost almost 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year. Oil prices have dropped by more than a third since summer, falling way below the level on which the Russian budget was based. However popular Mr. Putin may be with the masses, there is little question that in St. Petersburg, at least, where I\u2019m currently staying, people who have seen imported goods vanishing from their shelves, prices going up and the ruble falling almost by the day are deeply anxious. Conversations tend to turn quickly to \u201cthe crisis,\u201d as the problems are collectively referred to.So it should come as little surprise that Mr. Putin\u2019s annual state of the nation address on Thursday was closely scrutinized for how he intended to interpret and deal with the facts. The Russian ritual is similar to the American president\u2019s annual State of the Union speech, with the assembled political elite applauding every riff while hunting for the signals concealed behind the mandatory hype.One hint is the number of times certain words are mentioned, and Vedomosti, a financial daily that has maintained a degree of independence, came up with this count: \u201cRussia\u201d was heard 57 times; \u201ceconomy\u201d 26 times; \u201cCrimea\u201d came in third with 13 mentions. Vedomosti cautioned against making \u201cglobal conclusions from this arithmetic,\u201d but it was clear that the economy had become the No. 1 theme.The anti-Western fulminations that have become a fixture in Mr. Putin\u2019s repertoire were there in force, to be sure. One new twist that caught widespread attention was to equate the importance of Crimea for Russia to the Temple Mount for Jews, based on the fact that Vladimir the Great, who Christianized medieval Kievan Rus\u2019, was baptized in Crimea.The claim raised a slew of issues, such as the fact that Vladimir ruled in Kiev, which could be an argument for keeping Crimea in Ukraine, and that Israel has left the Temple Mount officially under Muslim authority. Mr. Putin also raised some eyebrows when he declared that Russia would never \u201cpursue paranoia, suspicion and looking for enemies,\u201d given that such possibilities had become one of the more worrying trends under his administration. But the nationalist words were seen largely as a mandatory sop to loyal Putinistas. The meat was in the economic news, and that consisted of three pledges. The first was to eliminate as much as possible the various regulations and inspections imposed on small and midsize businesses, a major source of corruption. The second was to freeze the business tax rate for the next four years. The third was to grant full amnesty to Russians who brought back money stashed abroad. The Russian finance minister has warned that capital outflow could reach $130 billion this year, more than double what it was in 2013. Initial reactions were mixed. Some business people welcomed the loosening of controls, while others felt it was too little. But at least the fact of \u201cthe crisis\u201d was not being denied.Uber AllAlso in the realm of fact versus interpretation was the extraordinary rise of Uber, the private car-sharing service that garnered $1.2 billion in new financing on Thursday, taking its value beyond $40 billion. The facts: Uber Technologies is barely five years old, is under fierce criticism for its approach to privacy and is being aggressively challenged by regulators and established taxi services around the world, in part because it lacks many of the basic insurance and rate rules governing car hires.None of that seems to faze Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s brash co-founder and chief executive, who has led the company on a breakneck expansion, taking the service to more than 250 cities in 50 countries, and plans to expand its use of private drivers to deliver goods and services. Uber claims it is six times larger today than it was just 12 months ago, and investors seem to believe that\u2019s only the beginning.Uber is the latest of a wave of start-ups that have used mobile technology to upend existing businesses and habits. But it has rapidly surged past other members of Silicon Valley\u2019s 11-digit club \u2014 start-ups whose valuation exceeds $10 billion. In fact, no other private venture-backed tech start-up is valued anywhere close.Score another one for interpretation over fact.Serge Schmemann is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Foes of Unions Try Their Luck in County Laws", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOWLING GREEN, Ky. \u2014 Conservative groups are opening a new front in their effort to reshape American law, arguing that local governments have the power to write their own rules on a key labor issue that has, up to now, been the prerogative of states.Beginning here in the hometown of Senator Rand Paul and the Chevy Corvette, groups including the American Legislative Exchange Council, the Heritage Foundation and a newly formed nonprofit called Protect My Check are working together to influence local governments the same way they have influenced state legislatures, and anti-union ordinances are just the first step in the coordinated effort they envision.A carefully devised plan began to unfold last week, when the Warren County Fiscal Court met here and preliminarily approved, in a 6 to 1 vote, a \u201cright to work\u201d ordinance that would allow employees represented by a union to opt out of paying union fees. This week two more Kentucky counties, Fulton and Simpson, followed suit, and a dozen more are expected to do the same in the next six weeks.Supporters of the effort say that if they are successful in Kentucky, they will try to pass similar local laws in Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and other places that do not have a statewide right-to-work law. Protect My Check is promising to pay for the legal battles of any local government that tries it.\u201cThere are literally thousands of targets for the initiative,\u201d said Brent Yessin, an anti-union consultant and lawyer who is on the board of advisers for Protect My Check, said at a recent meeting in Washington. \u201cDoing this county by county, city by city is more time consuming, but it\u2019s also more time consuming and draining for the unions to fight.\u201dThe session on local right-to-work ordinances was open to journalists; a session on combating local minimum wage increases was not. The panelists mapped out a strategy that included raising money from local businesses, persuading lawyers to work pro bono and convincing local politicians that supporting right-to-work ordinances would not be political suicide.Bill Londrigan, the president of the Kentucky State A.F.L.-C.I.O., objected: \u201cThis is being promoted here in Kentucky by outside interests who have nothing else in mind but to damage unions, weaken unions and lower wages.\u201dKentucky provides a perfect laboratory, said Jason M. Nemes, a Louisville lawyer involved in the initiative, because it is the lone Southern state that does not have a right-to-work law, and its neighbor West Virginia, where Republicans captured control of the Legislature last month, may soon pass one. Other states where Republicans expanded their control in the midterms, like New Mexico and Wisconsin, are also considering statewide bills.A right-to-work law became a major issue in Kentucky\u2019s midterm elections when Republicans, who control the State Senate, promised to pass one if they gained control of the House. They fell short of that goal, priming local officials like Judge-Executive Mike Buchanon, the elected head of Warren County, to act.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been interested in promoting right to work, and as all of our states around us became right to work, it has become a competitive issue,\u201d Mr. Buchanon said, asserting that many businesses would not even consider locating in areas without right-to-work laws. He added that he was put in touch with Protect My Check by Senator Paul or one of his aides and was promised that the county\u2019s legal bills would be covered.Mr. Yessin, based in Tampa, Fla., said his group\u2019s donors were not public but, other than his own contribution, all of the money raised so far had been from local businesses and employers in the targeted counties.Last week\u2019s vote in Bowling Green took local union members by surprise. It was advertised in advance as \u201can ordinance relating to the promotion of economic development and commerce,\u201d and there was little public comment, though there were presentations by the Chamber of Commerce and the Bluegrass Institute, a policy group with close ties to ALEC.\u201cIt was sprung on everybody,\u201d said Connie Warren, the financial secretary of the United Automobile Workers Local 2164. \u201cThe other side had all their ducks in a row; we didn\u2019t have even the opportunity to say how we felt about it.\u201dOfficials acknowledged that the county was doing relatively well without a right-to-work law. \u201cThe Warren County economy is very strong; it\u2019s very diversified,\u201d said Ron Bunch, the president of the local Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe have the lowest unemployment rate in Kentucky.\u201dBut they said they lost out on many prospects, pointing to Beretta, the gun manufacturer, which chose Gallatin, Tenn., 45 miles south, over Bowling Green as its new home. \u201cWhat we\u2019re passing is putting an \u2018Open for Business\u2019 sign on our front door,\u201d Mr. Buchanon said.It is difficult to measure the effects of right-to-work laws on wages and jobs, but experts say they do weaken unions, discouraging organizing efforts and creating \u201cfree riders,\u201d employees who benefit from collective bargaining but decline to pay fees. Unions and some economists argue that if right-to-work laws succeed in attracting businesses, it is because they drive down worker pay.Lynn Rhinehart, a lawyer with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., asserted that federal law unambiguously pre-empted local ordinances and that trying to prove otherwise was a waste of taxpayer money. \u201cNice try \u2014 state means state,\u201d she said. As for \u201cterritorial,\u201d she added, \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say it means Guam, and it doesn\u2019t mean county.\u201dMr. Buchanon said he believed that Kentuckians overwhelmingly favored the right to work and that union members had quietly told him that they did, too.Chad Poynor, a United Auto Workers committeeman at the Corvette plant, conceded as much, saying that concessions made by the union in recent years had angered rank-and-file members, even though the recession was largely to blame.\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a raise in eight years, so those things are hard to swallow. You hear people all the time say, \u2018If I were in a right-to-work state, I\u2019d withdraw\u2019\u00a0\u201d from the union, he said. \u201cBut you have to look at the big picture over the last 30 years, what we\u2019ve kept. We went through a bankruptcy and kept our pension. A lot of people can\u2019t say that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Reinvent Italy", "Date": "2014-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 ITALY has long suffered from inertia, its individual vitality smothered by the bureaucracy and opacity of the state. Italians are rich, prudent savers. Their state is poor, profligate and inefficient. For 30 years now, since I was a correspondent in Italy, I have watched the country deploy its ingenuity to evade modernization, culminating in the orgy of baroque escapism known as the Berlusconi years.So it was with some astonishment that I found Prime Minister Matteo Renzi sweeping in to meet me the other day in jeans and a white open-neck shirt (\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s casual Friday!\u201d), without the obsequious retinue of past Italian leaders, bearing a message of change. His aim: the creation of \u201cun paese smart\u201d \u2014 a smart country \u2014 that has \u201cstopped crying over itself.\u201dRenzi, who has been in office less than 10 months, is 39. This in itself is something unthinkable for the political gerontocracy that was Italy, the lugubrious state epitomized by the late Giulio Andreotti, who was prime minister seven times. \u201cThe new generation should do politics the American presidential way, two mandates and out,\u201d he told me during an hourlong interview in his office at Chigi Palace. \u201cI give myself a maximum of eight years if I win the next election, and then I\u2019ll leave politics.\u201d He is a man in a hurry: constitutional reform, electoral reform, sales on eBay of a fleet of official luxury cars, women thrust into top jobs (half the cabinet is female), plans to slash the number of members of Parliament and senators (currently almost 1,000 of them). \u201cIn America, notoriously smaller and less important than Italy, you have 535 representatives and senators,\u201d Renzi said, smiling, raising his eyebrows. Message received. He held up his portable device and said he wants the whole labyrinthine Italian public administration simplified on an app. \u201cThis is the future of our administration!\u201d he said. \u201cHow much pension do I get \u2014 all will be here.\u201dUn paese smart. The jeans and app talk send a message \u2014 no more business as usual. As a European politician in an age when national politics often seem a charade, outpaced by borderless finance, Renzi knows that symbolism is important in producing substance. The \u201cJobs Act,\u201d Renzi\u2019s pivotal economic reform, was approved by Parliament this month. It simplifies the labor code, makes it easier for companies with over 15 employees to fire workers, and links workers\u2019 protection to their length of service. By Italian job-for-life standards, it is a revolutionary step. To have a job was always to be \u201csistemato,\u201d which roughly meant security within the system forever.I asked Renzi why the legislation has an English name. \u201cBecause I like what Obama did,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most interesting things he\u2019s done have been on the domestic front. He took an economy in crisis in 2009, intervened, relaunched growth, and created jobs, all things that Europe has not succeeded in doing.\u201dThat sounds nice, but of course the American economy is hard-wired for growth, labor mobility and innovation. Italy\u2019s is hamstrung. It is saddled with climbing public debt and recession. Unemployment is over 13 percent. When I arrived in Italy, I found central Rome closed by protests against the \u201cJobs Act.\u201d Renzi has a big fight on his hands to get Italians to change their ways. His room to maneuver and pump up the economy is limited. The European Commission is warning that Italy may find itself in breach of the European Union\u2019s Stability and Growth Pact, which sets tight limits on budget deficits and stringent regulations on reducing debt. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said this month that any breach would be \u201cnegative for Europe.\u201d This sort of talk gets Renzi exercised because he believes it makes growth impossible. His Democratic Party is just seven years old. In a Europe where extremist and xenophobic parties have been growing, a reflection of widespread anger at high unemployment and stagnation, it represents an exception: a mainstream party of the center-left that has surged. This success has set up Renzi as perhaps the second-most-powerful politician in Europe after Merkel. In schematic terms, he\u2019s Mr. Anti-Austerity versus Ms. Austerity. He\u2019s also the only new game in town, with Britain caught in a debilitating debate over a possible exit from the European Union and France turning in circles under weak leadership.\u201cHere a lot of people have accused Merkel of being the guilty one in the crisis,\u201d Renzi said. \u201cBut the fault is not hers. It\u2019s ours. We got ourselves into this. If we had done labor reform 10 years ago, when Germany did it, we would have been a lot better off.\u201d Still, he went on, something has to give in a Europe caught \u201cin a dictatorship of bureaucrats and technocrats,\u201d unwilling to accept that \u201cpolitics is the realm of flexibility.\u201d Iron Frau, take note.The European economic model, Renzi declared, is wrong. \u201cWe cannot go on reasoning only on the basis of austerity and rigor. In a phase of deflation and stagnation, we can\u2019t. We have to keep our accounts in order, spend money well, yes, because Germany is preoccupied that southern countries don\u2019t spend money wisely \u2014 and it\u2019s true \u2014 but the central point is that if we tackle our problems, European economics must change in favor of investment in growth.\u201dI asked Renzi how. He said investment in strategic areas \u2014 digital broadband, education, research, energy, the green economy \u2014 \u201cshould be outside the calculation of the Stability Pact, which is the instrument of rigidity and austerity.\u201dHow, he asked, can he fight criminality and massive unemployment in Sicily if some Stability Pact formula on deficits and debt blocks him?The eurozone, in which Italy is the third-largest economy, is an unwieldy entity \u2014 tied by a shared currency, divided by everything from fiscal policy to culture. Anger over stagnation is boiling over. Renzi is right: Something has to give for Europe and its jobless youth. In the past, even Germany has broken Stability Pact rules in a time of need. Now it\u2019s payback time. But if Renzi gets some margin of budgetary flexibility, he must deliver. Waste and corruption are endemic to Italy. Curtailing them is a Sisyphean task. \u201cFirst I must put my own country in order,\u201d Renzi acknowledged. \u201cOtherwise I will never be credible.\u201dA spell has been broken in Italy. Politics have shifted. He compared the country to \u201ca sleeping beauty in the enchanted wood that can be woken up.\u201dThe beauty is certainly stirring. Whether she will now bound forward remains to be seen. Italians, versed in the rise and fall of powers and the vanity of ambition, tend to be skeptical of transformation. It will be an arduous journey. But I\u2019m inclined to give Renzi the benefit of the doubt. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Markets Eye an Austerity-Weary Greece", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the kind of talk that has built Mr. Tsipras a powerful following in this austerity-weary country. It has also spooked international investors as Greece faces the possibility of an unexpectedly early general election that could bring Mr. Tsipras and his party to power next year, opening the door to a sharp change in the nation\u2019s relationship with Europe and even a rethinking of its commitment to continued membership at all costs in the European currency.But while Greece is being closely watched by the rest of the European Union and global financial markets, the machinations here have not yet produced the sense of crisis felt across the Continent in 2012, when it last seemed possible that the country could drop out of the euro.In Brussels, in national capitals and on trading floors, there is a general sense that Europe could survive a breakup with Greece, if it came to that, with relatively minimal damage, thanks to an array of recent regulatory changes and a renewed commitment among the leaders of the largest countries to keeping the European Union moving forward even in the face of setbacks.The situation is shaping up as the first big test of Europe\u2019s progress in building safeguards against the financial contagion that rocked the Continent five years ago and insulating the core political union against the anti-European populist backlash from both left and right that has taken root in nearly every country.\u201cIf Greece were to step out, this would not lead to an immediate contagion threatening the other countries because financially we have strengthened the system,\u201d said Paul De Grauwe, a professor of European political economy at the London School of Economics. \u201cBut other risks \u2014 political risks \u2014 are still there.\u201dThe first step in the maneuvering toward a possible general election took place Wednesday evening, when Parliament took the first of three votes scheduled over the next several weeks to select a new president, a largely ceremonial post.If the current center-right government, led by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, cannot elect its presidential candidate by the end of the third vote, on Dec. 29, it is likely to call a quick general election, which polls at the moment suggest Mr. Tsipras\u2019s party would win. The government got 160 votes on Wednesday for its candidate, 40 short of the 200 necessary to prevail in this round and 20 short of the 180 necessary in the third and final round.\u201cThe architecture of the euro is much more solid, and an escalation of the crisis similar to what we saw in 2012 from any potential escalation in Greece is unlikely today,\u201d said Martin Lueck, an economist at the Swiss bank UBS in Frankfurt.The biggest remaining vulnerability to any shock induced by Greece may be political. With unemployment still high in most countries, national governments still cutting back on social welfare programs and divisive issues like immigration fueling intense debates, populist and nationalistic appeals from both left and right have resonated across the Continent, many of them with a distinct anti-European message. Should Mr. Tsipras take power in Greece, it would give more prominence and credibility to other anti-European parties.Mr. Tsipras and others on the far right and left in countries including Italy, France and Spain represent a backlash against everything the euro stands for, Professor De Grauwe said. \u201cToday the political elites who are currently in power have invested their capital in keeping the eurozone together,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now we have other politicians investing in doing exactly the opposite. Too many countries could at some point say, \u2018We don\u2019t want to be part of this,\u2019 and that could still drive the euro apart.\u201dThe longer governments wait to address the underlying causes of economic malaise, said Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, the more complex the economic challenges and the greater the political complications will be. \u201cEach delay reinforces economic obstacles to growth, empowers extreme political parties, and makes it harder for governments to agree on a common interpretation of the past and present, let alone come together to deliver a better future for the eurozone,\u201d he said.Eurozone leaders have also shied away from creating a federalist architecture to more readily transfer financial support to weak countries, which economists say is also critical to bolstering the euro\u2019s foundations.Mr. Tsipras has said he does not want Greece to leave the eurozone, and has made it a point to soften the fiery remarks he employed during national elections in 2012, when he threatened to tear up Greece\u2019s bailout agreement and default on the debt.Instead, he wants creditors to accept a write-down of the debt, saying that the nation, reeling from a five-year recession and a 25 percent unemployment rate, can probably never pay back all it owes. But he has threatened to reverse austerity cuts required for Greece to continue receiving its bailout money or a new credit line, including raising the minimum wage and reinstating Christmas bonuses. He has not said how he would pay for those spending increases.On the streets of Athens, such pledges hold growing appeal. Andonis Koulaxizis, 58, an accountant whose income has slumped amid a five-year recession, said he did not believe Mr. Tsipras could keep any of his promises. But he blamed the current government for worsening the economy, and said the prospect of edging Mr. Samaras from power was appealing, despite the wider risks that might come from fresh political chaos.\u201cNow is the opportunity to protest what this government has put us through,\u201d said Mr. Koulaxizis, whose clients have lost jobs and earnings, leaving many unable to pay him for his services.Other Greeks feel more frightened. After Mr. Samaras pushed forward the timing for the selection of a new president, \u20ac15 billion was wiped off the Athens stock exchange last week, and foreign investors immediately pulled back from Greece.\u201cEverything has stopped working, and the conversation about a possible exit is back again,\u201d said a person who helps run one of Greece\u2019s biggest construction companies, who declined to be named for fear of running afoul of politicians.\u201cWe are just on the verge of getting out of a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy destroy everything now?\u201dNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Way Back to Iran", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Rouzbeh Pirouz can still hear the raised voices, the sobbing. There was a list at Tehran airport. If you were on it you could not leave. Aged 7, he passed through the controls, after his mother. His father, a prominent businessman, did not follow. Agents of the newly birthed Islamic Republic stopped him, demanding that he provide an accounting of his activities under the shah. \u201cGo without me!\u201d he insisted. \u201cNever!\u201d Rouzbeh\u2019s mother screamed. Over the head of the small boy, disabled by a neuro-muscular condition, a parental argument raged. They left in tears, without his father. It was 1980, a year after the Iranian revolution, the turning point in his life, the line of fracture. Everything changed.Vancouver, a quiet place on the western edge of Canada\u2019s vastness, became his home. His family, once no more than a few Tehran blocks apart, was scattered across North America and Europe. The family holdings \u2014 orange groves, a mine, property \u2014 were expropriated. His father handed over a pile of cash to the enforcers of Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s theocracy \u2014 and was allowed to go. He insisted that Farsi be spoken at home. His language, at least, they could not take from him. It was a link. But Iran was little more than an abstraction to the young Pirouz, a faraway country. \u201cIt was the place I\u2019d left,\u201d he says, \u201cand would never go back to.\u201d He went to Stanford, then on to Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, then to Oxford with a Rhodes scholarship. He imagined for himself a comfortable North American life. Ayatollah Khomeini globalized Iranians. They were thrust, like Pirouz, from their family circles. The dispersal was painful. The culture, habits and landscape of Iran lay too deep in the new exiles to be completely erased. They adapted, were often successful, and acquired a worldly sophistication. Some ventured back, yielding over time to the tug of memory, whether personal or transmitted. They stayed a few days, or weeks, or perhaps longer, and discovered a country full of vitality, somehow familiar, yet isolated and repressive. The revolution sent Iranians into the world but severed Iran from it. Diaspora and homeland diverged. For those who had fled the Islamic Republic it was very difficult, if not impossible, to connect their new lives to the old. Such connection, if established, could be a game changer in these troubled times of fracture, doldrums and beheadings. Iran, 35 years after the birth of the Islamic Republic, is the great outlier of the global economy, the last sizeable emerging market to stand apart from integration. Iran\u2019s economy, despite sanctions and isolation, is one of the world\u2019s 20 biggest; its gas reserves are the world\u2019s second-largest. \u201cIt will make a gigantic difference when an economy this size joins the world, with implications for both Western and Asian economic interaction,\u201d said Hamid Biglari, who left Iran in 1977 to study in the United States and went on to become the vice chairman of Citicorp, before setting up his own investment company. \u201cA black hole will be connected to the rest of the universe.\u201d That is the objective for which Pirouz now works. Iran surfaced in his psyche out of nowhere. He was at Oxford, casting around for a subject for his doctorate. A professor suggested Iran; the idea was tempting enough to coax him back to the scene of childhood trauma. On arrival in Tehran he looked around and for the first time in his adult life saw a lot of people who looked like him. His home was gone, yet some sense of comfort remained. Nowhere else felt quite as familiar. Then chance intervened: a fellow Oxford student\u2019s idea for an Internet business, the heady late 90\u2019s dotcom madness, the herd instinct of people plowing money into the company, a timely sale before the crash. The head of his Oxford college, Sir Keith Thomas, thought Pirouz was mad to give up his doctorate for digital shenanigans. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d he said, \u201csurely you can get a deputy to do this for you!\u201d But Pirouz made the right call. Not yet 30, he found himself with enough to be very comfortable and acquire an office in Mayfair.He was quickly bored. Money rained down on central London as if a helicopter had unloaded buckets of the stuff. There were thousands of people like him; in Iran there would be very few. When he talked of his itch to go back, friends said he was crazy. His parents were desperately worried; this would end in tears. London attracts global money because there\u2019s the rule of law. In the Islamic Republic, one could disappear into a building with no address, no name, no marking on the door, and sit facing a wall while the same questions and accusations were repeated week after week. The risk was always there.But the opportunity to do something meaningful, to change ways of thinking in a country where some 60 percent of the population is under 30, was huge. Conspiracy theories are fundamentally paralyzing because their message is that whatever you do, it will not make a difference. Iran, with its history of periodic domination by outside powers, was awash in them. \u201cIranians never subscribe to the face-value theory of analysis,\u201d Pirouz says. \u201cIt might help them if they did.\u201d He decided to invest in the country and its youth to demonstrate that change was possible.Tehran became Pirouz\u2019s principal home. He set up an investment fund, Turquoise Partners (in time for a bull run on the Iranian stock market that lasted several years), and then devoted his energy to his pet project, the Iranian Business School (IBS), conceived in 2007. Iranians, he had found, are good traders but poor managers. Inefficiency is rife in a bloated state sector. Engineers are given management jobs without having any idea how to manage. Knowledge of the global economy and best practices is scarce. In all, the need for knowledge of advanced business management concepts in a country isolated for 35 years was patent.So the school, loosely modeled on the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, and the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, made sense. As with India and China it could help, at the right moment, to propel Iran into the global economy. Classes, which started in 2010, offer postgraduate training to future business leaders; hundreds of Iranian men and women have already attended. A significant expansion is now underway. On Oct. 4, 2013, the school received an Office of Foreign Assets Control license from the U.S. government, allowing it to raise money as a charity in the United States, bring American faculty to teach in Tehran and pay them. It is a bridge where very few exist.\u201cThe school will help raise awareness within the Iranian-American business community and open avenues for them to contribute,\u201d Biglari, who chairs the American board of IBS, said. To Pirouz, such connections are critical. They could constitute a turning point. He has always believed that isolating Iran only serves the hard-liners in the end. Sanctions have hurt Iran but you can find the latest iPhone in Tehran at a price: Cartels aligned with the Revolutionary guards grow fabulously wealthy smuggling from Dubai. \u201cAn Iran integrated in the global economy, with a growing private sector, will be good for Iran and the world,\u201d Pirouz says. He is committed for the long-term. Haste, goes an Iranian saying, is the devil\u2019s work.There is an enormous amount to be done. Mismanagement has been the curse of Iran. Banks, obliged to make nonperforming loans to state companies, are largely insolvent. A privatization program was bungled. There are water shortages. The Internet goes out all the time. The nuclear program, the object of the overwhelming bulk of attention paid to Iran, has itself been a colossal exercise in mismanagement, whatever else it may be: The cost of generating electricity from the nuclear facility at Bushehr has been beyond astronomical. A young population is frustrated, tired of Iran\u2019s pariah status, and eager to join the world, as President Hassan Rouhani has promised it will.This is a world, increasingly, of surface conflict and hidden connection. Of course, in the event of global war, the former will crush the latter. Short of that, it is important to see events on two levels \u2014 the confrontations between states and the cooperation between citizens empowered by technology and often, in this age of massive migrant flows, tied by family across continents. Pirouz is one such active citizen.The Iran debate is always framed in the context of confrontation. Entire cottage industries deploy themselves with ardor to fan conflict. But Iran\u2019s isolation serves nobody. There are real strategic differences between the Islamic Republic and the West that may still frustrate attempts to move beyond the nuclear issue and begin a process of fruitful reintegration. These ideological differences, however, are no greater than those between China and the United States at the time of the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 of 1972. It is this belief \u2014 in the benefit of connection and the sterility of separation \u2014 that has prodded Pirouz into an unlikely return. In the right circumstances, many in the diaspora could follow. Individuals can still defeat entrenched interests and lobbies, good sense prevail over the shallow cacophony.\u201cDid I come home? Not exactly,\u201d Pirouz says. \u201cThe world of my childhood is gone. But I discovered in myself a great yearning for Iran that I did not want to sacrifice to assimilation.\u201d Even his father now spends time in the country that took everything from him. It is, despite everything, his. What remains, for the completion of this story of full circles, is for Iran to return to the world. It is past time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine and Rebel Group Say They\u2019ll Recommit to a Cease-Fire", "Date": "2014-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Ukraine and one of two Russian-backed rebel groups fighting in eastern Ukraine have pledged to recommit to a cease-fire along one portion of the front, European monitors said on Tuesday, in the first new step toward a diplomatic settlement of the conflict in months.Under the agreement announced by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Ukrainian military and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic agreed to order a cease-fire along the front starting Friday, and then to pull heavy weaponry from a buffer zone starting Saturday.The O.S.C.E. announced the new cease-fire in the Luhansk region late Monday, after talks over the weekend. Some points remained to be ironed out, it said.But a critical issue was resolved when Luhansk rebel leaders agreed to control splinter groups; violence by organizations ostensibly beyond the separatist leadership\u2019s control became an all too frequent explanation for past cease-fire violations. Semi-independent militias also fight on the Ukrainian side.They \u201cinsisted that they were in control of all Cossack units and that these units, too, would adhere to this proposal,\u201d the group\u2019s statement said, referring to the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic. The separatists\u2019 leader, Igor Plotnitsky, confirmed the deal in an interview with Interfax, the Russian news agency.The Ukrainian government has said parallel talks with the other main rebel group, the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, halted artillery fire in a battle for the Donetsk airport for part of the day on Tuesday, though shelling resumed in the evening. A rebel leader, Andrei Purgin, told Russia\u2019s RIA news agency that his group hoped the sides would withdraw heavy weaponry from near the airport on Dec. 10.The monitoring group has negotiated similar \u201cquiet periods\u201d along sections of the front before, only to watch them collapse into renewed violence.Southeastern Ukraine has lurched between alarms over the resumption of full-scale warfare to signs that the rebels and their patron, Russia, want a deal quickly, as Russia\u2019s economy slides into recession.Kremlinologists say Ukraine policy is now fought over by rival hard-line and conciliatory factions at the top of the Russian government. Before the latest agreement, for example, NATO reported an accumulation of Russian weaponry and soldiers in rebel-held zones last month.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macau Looks Beyond Gambling as the Take From the Tables Slows", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMACAU \u2014 Macau had been on a hot streak.Over a span of 10 years, the Chinese territory reshaped itself from a sleepy Portuguese colony into the world\u2019s largest gambling destination. A flood of money from the increasingly wealthy mainland washed over the city and its residents, and the casino industry now dominates the economy.But this autumn, gambling revenue dropped precipitously, by nearly 20 percent in November from the same month last year. The stocks of casino operators have slumped after Beijing announced that the Chinese police would be cracking down on the flow of illicit money through the territory.That move came ahead of a visit by President Xi Jinping of China, who arrived in Macau on Friday as part of the city\u2019s commemoration of the 15th anniversary of its handover from Portuguese to Chinese control.Macau is taking a hard look at how to wean itself off its heavy reliance on gambling. Casino resorts are using diverse approaches \u2014 like Shrek-themed breakfast buffets for families and boxing title fights \u2014 to attract mainland Chinese visitors who will spend at least some of their vacation money away from the tables.\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for Macau to attract a new breed of customer, one which is looking for a more holistic experience,\u201d said Aaron Fischer, a gambling analyst at the brokerage firm CLSA.Beijing has openly pressed the Macau government to diversify into a \u201cfamily-style entertainment zone\u201d with less reliance on gambling.\u201cThe dominance of one industry can lead the city to prosperity, but it also can lead to its demise,\u201d Li Gang, director of the Central People\u2019s Government Liaison Office in Macau, said this last week.It is a message for casino operators as well, as several gambling concessions will come up for renewal beginning in 2016. One of the main criteria for the assessment of casino operators will be their development of nongambling facilities.Nongambling revenue at the resorts now accounts for 10 percent of revenue at most, compared with 60 percent in Las Vegas, Mr. Fischer said.For Macau, the Vegas model of an all-inclusive holiday destination in which gambling is only part of the experience is increasingly appealing.On the first day of the Macao Gaming Show last month, Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of the Macau Government Tourist Office, played up the territory\u2019s charms outside the casinos.\u201cWe want this type of exhibition to allow people from all over the world to learn more about Macau,\u201d Ms. Fernandes said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be all about gaming.\u201dBut gambling has been a cash cow that last year injected more than $45.2 billion into the economy of this city of half a million people. The gambling sector accounts for just over 80 percent of Macau\u2019s economy, Carlos Siu Lam, an associate professor at the Gaming Teaching and Research Center at Macao Polytechnic Institute, estimated.But Chinese gamblers, particularly the high rollers, have been staying away. The shift has been driven by anticorruption measures, a slowing Chinese economy and a lack of confidence in junket operations \u2014 in which middlemen act on behalf of the casinos to attract big spenders by arranging their travel and handling their gambling credit.Fitch Ratings predicts that Macau\u2019s economy will shrink 1 percent in 2015 and warns that weakness in the V.I.P. market may spread to ordinary visitors. The city government\u2019s budget for next year is based on little change in tax revenue from this year \u2014 suggesting that zero growth is expected.\u201cShort term, we are quite bearish\u201d on the Macau market, said Mr. Fischer of CLSA.Transforming Macau, though, won\u2019t be easy.Softness in the V.I.P. segment of Macau\u2019s gambling industry has made the mass market more important. Millions of middle-class mainland Chinese with disposable income have plenty of options for gambling in South Korea and several Southeast Asian countries.The large lower end of the mass market may have been priced out of the casinos, with the minimum bet at some tables doubling since last year to more than $250, Mr. Fischer said. There is also a generational fault line: older, hard-core gamblers who tend to play baccarat, and lots of it, and younger travelers who view gambling as only one part of their experience in Macau.Macau\u2019s short supply of land will also constrict growth..\u201cWe believe Macau is a tourism story, and without more hotel rooms, then Macau can\u2019t grow the overnight visitor market,\u201d Mr. Fischer said. Macau\u2019s casino operators have around 16,000 hotel rooms, compared with 160,000 hotel rooms in Las Vegas.The older gambling district of the city \u2014 home to the Grand Lisboa, whose owner is the Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, and to the first casinos opened by Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts \u2014 is all but built up. A newly developed area known as the Cotai Strip is where Macau\u2019s future is being developedThe strip is abuzz with construction. A wave of eight large-scale casino resort is to open starting in the middle of next year, along with the second phase of the Galaxy Macau.By the end of 2015, Las Vegas Sands will open its fourth property on the Cotai Strip \u2014 the $2.7 billion Parisian Macao, which will feature a half-scale Eiffel Tower replica. Shortly after, Melco Crown Entertainment\u2019s Studio City Resort is expected to open, followed by the $4 billion Wynn Palace. Expansion is underway at the Sands-owned Venetian resort, currently Macau\u2019s largest. Near the Venetian, a Chinese state-owned construction company is building the $2.9 million MGM Cotai.The central government has also earmarked the adjacent island of Hengqin to partly relieve Macau\u2019s land shortage.All of these mega-resort projects \u2014 with their casinos and nongambling features like hotels, restaurants, retail and entertainment \u2014 will require tens of thousands of employees. That suggests that government action on easing immigration and a ban on foreigners working certain jobs on the casino floor will probably come sooner than later. Immigration is a sensitive issue in tiny Macau, and allowing foreigners to work in the gambling areas of the casinos is likely to upset local labor unions.\u201cWe simply don\u2019t have enough of a work force, so we need to import workers,\u201d Mr. Siu said. \u201cBut the question of how to do this in a socially acceptable way is something that needs discussion and compromise.\u201dOn Saturday, Macau\u2019s head of government, Fernando Chui Sai On, will begin his second term. A new secretary for economy and finance, Lionel Leong Vai Tac, will be charged with overseeing the gambling industry. Mr. Leong has been quoted by the Macau news media as saying he favors relaxing labor import restrictions.More significant, Mr. Chui\u2019s inauguration will be attended by Mr. Xi, the president. Given the effect of Mr. Xi\u2019s anticorruption campaign on Macau\u2019s gambling and the amount of political weight he can throw behind new initiatives, whatever is said over the weekend is likely to ripple through the industry and guide future development.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Putin Forged a Pipeline Deal That Derailed ", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPutin's WaySOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 Barely two weeks after President Vladimir V. Putin annexed Crimea on one side of the Black Sea, he won a different prize on the other side. In Bulgaria\u2019s Parliament, lawmakers gave initial passage to a bill clearing the way for a mammoth gas pipeline from Russia.The pipeline, known as South Stream, was Mr. Putin\u2019s most important European project, a tool of economic and geopolitical power critical to twin goals: keeping Europe hooked on Russian gas, and further entrenching Russian influence in fragile former Soviet satellite states as part of a broader effort to undermine European unity.The bill that Parliament took up on April 4 was arcane. But it swept aside a host of European regulations \u2014 rules that Mr. Putin did not want to abide by \u2014 for a pipeline that would deliver gas throughout southern Europe.It was a dream bill for Mr. Putin, and with reason. While Bulgaria\u2019s Energy Ministry ostensibly wrote the legislation, documents reveal the hidden hand of the Kremlin: Not only did much of the language come from a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant, Gazprom, but Mr. Putin\u2019s energy minister was directly involved.\u201cIf this happens in the U.S., the whole government would resign,\u201d said Martin Dimitrov, a minister of Parliament from Bulgaria\u2019s Reformist Bloc. \u201cNot in Bulgaria, apparently.\u201dBut if the story of South Stream shows how larger geopolitical concerns can, at least temporarily, limit Mr. Putin\u2019s ability to use his energy riches as a foreign-policy tool, it is also a case study of how he has operated in Europe, and will probably continue to do so.He has won influence abroad by wielding the tools of crony capitalism that have made him so powerful at home. After a secret meeting between Bulgaria\u2019s prime minister and the head of Gazprom, pipeline contracts were given to a company controlled by a member of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle and politically connected Bulgarian companies.In Russia, Mr. Putin has at times used Russia\u2019s state-owned banks for his own ends; they helped underwrite the Sochi Olympics, for instance. In Bulgaria, a subsidiary of one of those banks, VTB, showered the country with politically strategic investments as Mr. Putin pushed the government to move forward on South Stream.As elsewhere in Europe, Mr. Putin courted Bulgaria\u2019s pro-Russian far right party, which promoted Russian interests by helping to beat back plans to explore for Bulgarian shale gas. Seeking to nail down support for South Stream, a member of the Russian Parliament, whose card identified him as a special emissary of Mr. Putin, even offered what one former Energy Ministry official understood to be a tacit bribe.\u201cIt\u2019s not just South Stream, and it\u2019s not just Bulgaria,\u201d said the Bulgarian official, Bojan Stoyanov, who was deputy energy minister in 2013. \u201cThe Russians are promoting behavior where people are willing to dig the hole of a volcano in the middle of their country and not worry where the lava goes as long as they get paid.\u201dPutin\u2019s Favorite MusiciansVladimir Putin had a problem.By 2011, his plan to build South Stream, estimated to cost more than $40 billion and four years in the making, had hit a stumbling block in Bulgaria, where the pipeline would make landfall after traversing the bed of the Black Sea. Geological surveys suggested that Bulgaria could be sitting atop an underground ocean of natural gas, enough to be self-sufficient for years, enough to eclipse the advantages of South Stream.Bulgaria, once a staunch Soviet ally, and Russia share similarities in language, religion and culture, and Bulgaria still celebrates as a national holiday its 1878 liberation from the Ottoman Empire by the troops of the czar. Bulgarian leaders supported South Stream, declaring that the pipeline would provide not just transit fees but energy security: The country receives 90 percent of its gas from Russia, along a route through Ukraine that has left it vulnerable to periodic pricing disputes between Moscow and Kiev. In the winter of 2009, Bulgarians were left shivering for two weeks when Russia shut off the gas to teach Ukraine a lesson.In Bulgaria, Volen Siderov, the chairman of Ataka, said his party received no direct funds from Moscow.\u201cI\u2019ll ask her how she managed to do it,\u201d he joked of Ms. Le Pen.Still, Mr. Siderov has undeniably close ties to the Kremlin. He kicked off his most recent political campaign in Moscow, where he was receiving the Fatherland Star medal for promoting closer relations between Russia and Bulgaria. When he needed entertainment for a rally this fall, he landed singers described in Ataka promotional literature as \u201cPutin\u2019s favorite musicians\u201d: Oleg Gazmanov, an aging Russian pop singer, and Iosif Kobzon, a lawmaker and singer who recently performed in Donetsk, a Russian separatist-held stronghold in eastern Ukraine, accompanied by the orchestra of Mr. Putin\u2019s Interior Ministry.The anti-fracking movement became so broad that in January 2012, Parliament banned not only the extraction of shale gas, but even exploration that would quantify the country\u2019s reserves. Environmentalists praised the vote, but many Western officials were suspicious.In Brussels, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, secretary general of NATO, later accused the Russian government of using \u201csophisticated information and disinformation operations\u201d to help derail shale gas exploration in Bulgaria and other countries.With the death of shale gas, South Stream\u2019s rationale was stronger than ever, especially as the Borisov government weakened. Mr. Borisov had signed preliminary pipeline agreements, even once presenting a puppy to Mr. Putin as a gift, but he was still considered pro-Western. Barely a year after the fracking demonstrations, Ataka members again took to the streets, joining protests over high electricity prices. In March 2013, Mr. Borisov resigned.A caretaker government was appointed, pending new elections, and Mr. Putin\u2019s representatives quickly sought out the crucial figures involved in South Stream.The Putin SteamrollerThe meeting occurred after midnight at La Casa del Habano, a cigar bar in Sofia. Mr. Stoyanov, a New York-based corporate turnaround specialist who had returned to Bulgaria to serve as deputy energy minister in the interim government, had received several calls from an old acquaintance, insisting they meet for a drink.But Mr. Stoyanov was surprised to find that his friend was not alone at the bar. With him was Aleksandr M. Babakov, a member of the Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, whom Mr. Putin had appointed as a special envoy. (Mr. Babakov has been identified by the French news media as the middleman who arranged the Russian bank loan to the National Front in France.)The purpose of the meeting soon became clear. \u201cHe wanted to take my temperature on the South Stream,\u201d Mr. Stoyanov recalled in an interview.Mr. Stoyanov said the project would not reduce Bulgaria\u2019s dependence on Russian gas and would bring marginal economic benefit, but Mr. Babakov had not come to debate the merits.\u201cIn not so many words, he said he would make me very comfortable if I would participate and help,\u201d Mr. Stoyanov said, adding that he reported the encounter to Bulgarian intelligence. \u201cI was not pleased by his presumption that I would just set aside and forget Bulgaria\u2019s national interests.\u201dMr. Babakov did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Stoyanov\u2019s skepticism about South Stream mirrored that of officials in Brussels and Washington. European Union rules forbid the same company that produces gas to monopolize the pipeline that delivers it. Europe insisted that South Stream allow access to other gas producers in order to safeguard against overreliance on Russia.At one European summit meeting several years ago, Mr. Putin and the European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, argued over those rules, according to C. Boyden Gray, an American diplomat who in 2008 served as special envoy for Eurasian energy. Two officials in the room told Mr. Gray that the Russian leader exploded.\u201cIf I hear one more word about competition, I\u2019m going to freeze your you-know-whats off,\u201d Mr. Putin reportedly shouted.Mr. Barroso, whose term expired in October, said he did not recall the specifics of the exchange but confirmed that he and Mr. Putin had clashed.\u201cHis point was always: \u2018This is against us! This is against Gazprom! This is against Russia!\u2019 \u201d Mr. Barroso recalled.By the time Bulgaria held elections in May 2013, Mr. Putin was in a stronger position. He had proposed South Stream as an alternative to a Western-backed proposal for a pipeline, called Nabucco, from Azerbaijan to southern Europe. Nabucco would have reduced Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas, as well as Mr. Putin\u2019s influence. But the project had died by 2013 because of political and economic obstacles as well as interference from Mr. Putin. Now only South Stream was left standing.Moreover, the Russians had already invested heavily in Bulgaria. VTB Capital, the investment wing of Russia\u2019s second-largest state-owned bank, had opened a Sofia office, placing Bulgaria\u2019s former finance minister, his deputy and the minister\u2019s brother in major positions. VTB Capital, which declined to comment for this article, then partnered to buy stakes in a host of companies with Corporate Commercial, known as the favored bank of Bulgaria\u2019s energy oligarchs. VTB even took a 9.9 percent stake in the bank itself.The Bulgarian elections also seemed to work to Mr. Putin\u2019s advantage. They produced an awkward coalition government between two pro-Russia parties \u2014 the Socialists and the Turkish minority party. And since together they could not achieve a parliamentary majority, they relied on Ataka to achieve a quorum. Mr. Siderov, Ataka\u2019s leader, was nicknamed the Golden Finger because he tipped the balance.The new prime minister was a technocrat, Plamen Oresharski, who found himself caught between this Moscow-leaning coalition and growing pressure from the European Union. Aleksei B. Miller, the man Mr. Putin had chosen to lead Gazprom, was sent in July to bring the Bulgarians into line. He promised to finance the \u20ac3.1 billion construction of the Bulgarian leg of the pipeline and agreed to sponsor Levski Sofia, the capital\u2019s top professional soccer team.But Europe was pushing Mr. Oresharski, too. The European Commission had begun an investigation into Bulgarian Energy Holdings, the state corporation that was to be Gazprom\u2019s partner in South Stream.Three months later, Mr. Miller returned to Sofia, this time in secret, for another session with Mr. Oresharski. It was supposed to last only 40 minutes, one official said. Months later, prodded about the lack of transparency, Mr. Oresharski angrily responded that the \u201conly nontransparent thing with South Stream is my five-hour conversation with the boss of Gazprom, the contents of which will never be revealed.\u201dMr. Oresharski did not respond to requests for an interview. But Russian interests clearly won out. The next day, Mr. Oresharski and Mr. Miller watched by video link as workers welded the first two joints of the pipeline\u2019s Bulgarian leg.A few months later, over the Christmas holidays and without public notice, the construction contracts were awarded: Bulgarian news outlets subsequently reported that the winners included companies with ties to a Bulgarian media mogul and member of Parliament, Delyan Peevski. In a statement, Mr. Peevski denied any ties to the project, calling the reports rumors \u201cspread by the yellow press in Bulgaria.\u201d The acknowledged Russian construction partner was Gennady N. Timchenko, one of Mr. Putin\u2019s most powerful allies.All seemed ready. The only obstacle was the European pipeline rules \u2014 unless they could be circumvented.Pipeline That\u2019s Not a PipelineOn April 4, 2014, soon after Mr. Putin annexed Crimea, Bulgaria\u2019s Parliament gave initial passage to a bill that effectively exempted South Stream from a number of European Union regulations, most important, the one that would have forced Gazprom to allow non-Russian gas to flow through the pipeline. Both parties in Mr. Oresharski\u2019s coalition supported the legislation, as did Ataka and its leader, Mr. Siderov.The bill accomplished this with a linguistic sleight of hand: The initial Bulgarian section of South Stream was not actually a pipeline, but rather a \u201cgas-sea\u201d interconnector. The European Union challenged the proposed change, while opposition members filed a freedom of information request for documents linked to the bill. A month later, they announced that the documents \u2014 which have been obtained by The New York Times \u2014 proved that Gazprom and the Kremlin were directly involved.\u201cThis was a unique breach of national security,\u201d Grozdan Karadzhov, a Reformist lawmaker, said in an interview. \u201cIt was also a unique amount of arrogance in how Russians see Bulgaria.\u201dThe documents included passages of draft legislation suggested by a Gazprom subsidiary and forwarded to Bulgarian energy officials.In an interview, the energy minister at the time, Dragomir Stoynev, called Gazprom\u2019s suggestions a form of lobbying, insisting that \u201cnobody dictated the terms; these were all our suggested changes.\u201dBut in a letter dated June 6, 2014, Mr. Stoynev acknowledged a direct Russian hand. In it, he updated his Russian counterpart, Mr. Putin\u2019s energy minister, on where things stood. The \u201claw amendments proposed by the Russia side\u201d were discussed in detail, he wrote, and a number of them were approved by Parliament.It was audacious, but it would not be enough. The bill would never be brought up for a second, final vote, largely because of the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In early June, the European Commission told Bulgaria to stop work on South Stream, saying it was investigating whether the pipeline construction contracts violated European competitive-bidding rules. When the Bulgarian government refused, the European Union cut off tens of millions of euros in regional development funds.By this point, Ukrainian government forces were battling pro-Russian separatists in the east, and in the West there was talk of a new Cold War. On June 6, the American ambassador, Marcie B. Ries, warned Bulgarian companies against doing business with companies linked to Mr. Timchenko, who is on American sanctions lists. On June 8, a congressional delegation led by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, met privately with Mr. Oresharski.In desperate need of the European funds, the prime minister announced the next day that South Stream would be halted until it had full European Union approval.At almost exactly the same moment, an unexpected panic swept through bank depositors in Sofia; a mysterious bank run had started at Corporate Commercial, the bank that had partnered with the Russian investment firm VTB Capital, and the financial institution of the state holding company overseeing Bulgarian involvement in South Stream.Some speculated that VTB Capital, with its nearly 10 percent stake, would join other shareholders in riding to the bank\u2019s rescue. But after Mr. Oresharski\u2019s decision to halt the Bulgarian leg of South Stream, the Russian bank declined to participate in a bailout. Corporate Commercial collapsed, and in the ensuing crisis so did Mr. Oresharski\u2019s government.The final, unexpected development came on Dec. 1 when Mr. Putin, on a state visit to Turkey, announced that South Stream was dead. He blamed Europe and, according to press reports in Turkey, said he was \u201cfed up with Bulgarians.\u201dSince then, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Europe\u2019s most powerful leader, has suggested that South Stream might yet be built. After meeting with her, the new Bulgarian prime minister said he was confident European Union objections could be overcome.Even if they are not, some diplomats contend that Mr. Putin achieved many of his goals.While \u201che overreached, and he underestimated the response\u201d to his intervention in Ukraine, said Mr. Gray, the former American diplomat, the Russian leader has been \u201cquite effective\u201d in countries like Bulgaria.\u201cHe won a great deal by getting Nabucco stopped,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cUltimately, his goal is to keep as much control over the former parts of the Soviet empire as possible.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about tactics used by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to win Bulgarian approval for a natural gas pipeline under the Black Sea misidentified the professional Bulgarian soccer team that Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant, agreed to sponsor to sweeten the deal. The team is Levski Sofia, not CSKA Sofia. (While the Bulgarian prime minister originally said Gazprom would sponsor CSKA Sofia, the company later changed its mind.)Jim Yardley reported from Sofia, and Jo Becker from Budapest and New York. Georgi Kantchev contributed reporting from Sofia, and Masha Goncharova from New York.Putin\u2019s Way: Articles in this series are examining how\nPresident Vladimir V.

It\u2019s a fictional forecast of a data-deterministic culture in which computer algorithms constantly analyze consumers\u2019 profiles, issuing individuals numeric rankings that may benefit or hinder them.Observing a street billboard that publicly broadcasts the score of each passer-by, the Abramov character says in the novel, \u201cThe old Chinese woman had a decent 1,400, but others, the young Latina mothers, even a profligate teenaged Hasid puffing down the street, were showing blinking red scores below 900, and I worried for them.\u201dBoth books outline how consumer scoring works. Data brokers amass dossiers with thousands of details about individual consumers, like age, religion, ethnicity, profession, mortgage size, social networks, estimated income and health concerns such as impotence and irritable bowel syndrome. Then analytics engines can compare patterns in those variables against computer forecasting models. Algorithms are used to assign consumers scores \u2014 and to recommend offering, or withholding, particular products, services or fees \u2014 based on predictions about their behavior.But while both books emphasize the notion that consumer reputations are vulnerable to such covert scoring apparatuses, the authors differ markedly in the steps they say ordinary people might take to protect themselves.Befitting the founder of a firm that markets reputation management, Mr. Fertik contends that individuals have some power to influence commercial scoring systems. He presents nascent technologies, like online education courses that can score people on the specific practical skills or concepts they have mastered, as democratizing forces that could enable workers to better compete for jobs on merit. His book suggests that readers curate, or hack, their digital reputations \u2014 for instance, by emphasizing certain keywords on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to position them better for predictive scoring engines, or by posting positive reviews of restaurants or hotels online, in the hope that algorithms will flag them for future V.I.P. treatment. \u201cEmployers\u2019 algorithms will pick your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 out of the pile of thousands just as instantaneously and robotically as they pass over others,\u201d he and his co-author write. \u201cBanks and lenders will automatically approve you for the better rates and offers. The more appealing dates on apps and sites like Tinder, Match and OkCupid will see your profile before they see any others.\u201dThink of this technique as reputation engine optimization. If an algorithm incorrectly pegs you as physically unfit, for instance, the book suggests that you can try to mitigate the wrong. You can buy a Fitbit fitness tracker, for instance, and upload the exercise data to a public profile \u2014 or even \u201csnap that Fitbit to your dog\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ll quickly be the fittest person in your town.\u201d Professor Pasquale offers a more downbeat reading. Companies, he says, are using such a wide variety of numerical rating systems that it would be impossible for average people to significantly influence their scores.\u201cCorporations depend on automated judgments that may be wrong, biased or destructive,\u201d Professor Pasquale writes. \u201cFaulty data, invalid assumptions and defective models can\u2019t be corrected when they are hidden.\u201dMoreover, trying to influence scoring systems could backfire. If a person attached a fitness device to a dog and tried to claim the resulting exercise log, he suggests, an algorithm might be able to tell the difference and issue that person a high score for propensity toward fraudulent activity.\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t think they can outwit corporations with hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Professor Pasquale said in a phone interview. Consumers would have more control, he argues, if Congress extended the right to see and correct credit reports to other kinds of rankings.\u201cIf credit scores can be regulated,\u201d he says, \u201cwhy not the scoring systems used by digital advertisers and employers?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Facing them will be Bulgari and Christian Dior. About 20 top-drawer brands are to open in the district this month, in individual buildings along spotless walkways and streets, in the manner of Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, Fla., and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif.For decades, Bal Harbour was the only shopping center in the Miami area where customers were assured a wide choice of luxury goods. Now, it has lost some of retail\u2019s choicest names, like Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s, Cartier, Emilio Pucci, Givenchy and several others, to the Design District.In Miami and its environs, a thumping economy is continuing to animate a construction boom. And in the once-genteel world of luxury retail, it has spurred a no-holds-barred skirmish for the attentions of the roughly 14 million people who arrive each year, many of them cash-wielding visitors from Latin America, Russia and Western Europe, and the five million people who live here and in the area, including Broward and Palm Beach Counties.\u201cSeventy percent of the retail sales in Miami are to visitors from Latin America,\u201d said Deborah Overholt, the center\u2019s retail leasing director. \u201cTheir No. 1 priority is luxury. That\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for.\u201dIn 2012, she said, visitors staying at hotels in the Brickell area alone, which includes the Mandarin Oriental and the Four Seasons, spent $800 million on shopping in and around Miami.The Brickell project, she said, will cater to that clientele. As for the Design District, Ms. Overholt said she was not concerned that it may pull away a hefty amount of business long before Brickell can open its doors. \u201cWe feel that high tides float all boats,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s better for everyone if we\u2019re all successful.\u201dDevelopers and shopkeepers seem unfazed, at least for now, about warnings in recent quarterly reports from many high-end brands. \u201cMost of the negative financial issues in the luxury market are in China and Europe,\u201d Mr. Robins said. \u201cBut business in the U.S. remains robust, increasing the importance of the Miami market.\u201dMatthew W. Lazenby, the 37-year-old president and chief executive of Whitman Family Development, Bal Harbour\u2019s parent company, seemed untroubled, too.\u201cOver the years, Bal Harbour Shops has proved to be largely defiant in terms of bucking prevailing trends, even in the luxury sector,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tend to think in terms of decades, not quarters, so we are somewhat intentionally oblivious to flash-in-the-pan trends.\u201dYet Bal Harbour\u2019s long hegemony over Miami\u2019s top-tier retail market has faltered, apparently, at least in part because of its own rules. For decades, Bal Harbour leases stipulated that if tenants opened stores elsewhere in South Florida, percentages of their sales had to be paid to Bal Harbour\u2019s owners, the Whitman family. To some leaseholders, it amounted to a prohibition on unfettered commerce.Mr. Lazenby said that some \u201cbad blood\u201d remained in the wake of the leases\u2019 so-called radius clause. \u201cWe did have a firm stance in the past, but we\u2019re not taking that stance anymore,\u201d said Mr. Lazenby, whose grandfather Stanley F. Whitman built the shops in 1965. \u201cWe frankly learned a lot from all this.\u201dBut in what seems a display of confidence, Bal Harbour now is seeking approval of a $300 million expansion that will add roughly 300,000 square feet of store space, including a third department store to join Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus.On a recent Saturday, Bal Harbour\u2019s parking lot was all but full as shoppers chatting in various languages ambled in and out of Balenciaga, Chanel, Harry Winston and some of the 100 or so other stores. Only a couple of shops on the top floor were boarded up, awaiting new tenants. On the ground floor, open to the sky and the palms, three sleek, shiny Jaguars were lined up. \u201cWe lease vehicles to foreign nationals,\u201d a pamphlet said in Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and English.\u201cThis is still a destination,\u201d said Marquietta Buffaloe, a sales assistant at the Bal Harbour outpost of the South Florida chain Books & Books, where sales last year were up 7.5 percent over 2012.At least one Bal Harbour shopper was irked that, after 30 years, Louis Vuitton had left and opened in the Design District and Aventura. \u201cI hated it when that happened,\u201d said Ana Fernandez, who lives less than three miles away. \u201cI liked it here. But it\u2019s not going to stop me from going to Louis Vuitton just because it\u2019s not here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conquest Is for Losers", "Date": "2014-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than a century has passed since Norman Angell, a British journalist and politician, published \u201cThe Great Illusion,\u201d a treatise arguing that the age of conquest was or at least should be over. He didn\u2019t predict an end to warfare, but he did argue that aggressive wars no longer made sense \u2014 that modern warfare impoverishes the victors as well as the vanquished. Angell\u2019s case was simple: Plunder isn\u2019t what it used to be. You can\u2019t treat a modern society the way ancient Rome treated a conquered province without destroying the very wealth you\u2019re trying to seize. And meanwhile, war or the threat of war, by disrupting trade and financial connections, inflicts large costs over and above the direct expense of maintaining and deploying armies. War makes you poorer and weaker, even if you win.Which brings us to two big questions. First, why did Mr. Putin do something so stupid? Second, why were so many influential people in the United States impressed by and envious of his stupidity?The answer to the first question is obvious if you think about Mr. Putin\u2019s background. Remember, he\u2019s an ex-K.G.B. man \u2014 which is to say, he spent his formative years as a professional thug. Violence and threats of violence, supplemented with bribery and corruption, are what he knows. And for years he had no incentive to learn anything else: High oil prices made Russia rich, and like everyone who presides over a bubble, he surely convinced himself that he was responsible for his own success. At a guess, he didn\u2019t realize until a few days ago that he has no idea how to function in the 21st century.The point is that there is a still-powerful political faction in America committed to the view that conquest pays, and that in general the way to be strong is to act tough and make other people afraid. One suspects, by the way, that this false notion of power was why the architects of war made torture routine \u2014 it wasn\u2019t so much about results as about demonstrating a willingness to do whatever it takes. I have no idea what will become of the Putin regime. But Mr. Putin has offered all of us a valuable lesson. Never mind shock and awe: In the modern world, conquest is for losers. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inequality Measured by Services", "Date": "2014-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From AmericaAs this all-too-interesting year flickers out, I learned of a pair of services that seemed to distill what America grappled with becoming in 2014.You may be interested in one, but there is scant chance you\u2019ll be interested in both, because they belong to first- and third-world Americas that are contemporary but don\u2019t overlap.The first service is called Alfred, and it is what it sounds like: a kind of butler service. The brainchild of two Harvard Business School graduates, it won a prestigious 2014 start-up competition organized by TechCrunch, the in-house newsletter of Silicon Valley. Writing in the Silicon Valley dialect, TechCrunch described Alfred as \u201cthe first service layer on the shared economy that manages your routine across multiple on-demand and local services.\u201d Fortunately, the technology writer at Slate, Will Oremus, was able to translate: \u201cAs far as I can tell, the idea is basically \u2018Uber for servants.\u201d\u2019 In the service, Alfreds, who are hired via smartphones, come over weekly to put your laundry into the closet, clean the house and perform tasks \u201clike putting new paper towels on a towel holder,\u201d according to TechCrunch.The other service is called Dee\u2019s Tots Childcare, and it, too, is what it sounds like: day care. But not just any day care. It is \u201cextreme day care,\u201d a growing phenomenon described by the journalist Alissa Quart. Dee\u2019s Tots is a 24-hour day care in New Rochelle, N.Y., light on education, heavy on chaos management, and catering to an American underclass that has lost bargaining power.The parents who send their children to Dee\u2019s work all hours of the day and night. Many work two 29-hours-a-week jobs, because 30 hours would legally commit an employer to providing health care benefits. Brilliant algorithms developed by the technology elite help big companies scramble schedules, change shift times and reduce hours at the last minute, to maximize the equation of revenue divided by wages. As Ms. Quart writes, \u201cThe software doesn\u2019t care if a shift falls in the middle of the night, or that it might tear a big hole in an employee\u2019s family life.\u201dEveryone knows about the widening inequality in America. But these services make one wonder whether it\u2019s a matter of haves and have-nots\u2019 coexisting, or whether the having is more deeply implicated in the not-having. Are the perks of living in the upper echelon of America today \u2014 Amazon\u2019s bargain prices and shipping, Uber\u2019s on-demand ease, Alfred\u2019s gig-based hiring \u2014 somebody else\u2019s health care-starved, chaotically scheduled, midnight-day-care pain?Americans seem to be adjusting to the idea of living in what is becoming a \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d republic, an upstairs-downstairs society where the stairs are creaky and it\u2019s dangerous not to know your place.If you\u2019re fortunate enough to live upstairs, you can avail yourself not just of Alfred but of \u201cfitness concierges\u201d who bring you bananas and motivate you to go to the gym; task gofers who stand in Apple Store lines for you; and working-poor moms and dads with full-time jobs who supplement their pay by driving you to dinner.As was true in the fictional \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d it\u2019s easier, when sitting upstairs, not to inquire why so many of your fellow citizens happen to be available for menial work on demand at the ringing of a bell (physical or virtual): why so many college graduates will fold your laundry, why so many former business owners want to drive you.In fact, the ease may depend on the chaos, and the chaos on the ease, more than we\u2019d like to confess. \u201cInequality\u201d is another way of saying that some people can afford the time of others.New tools not only make it easier to locate those people, but in creating a contractual marketplace of free-agent gigs, they give the upstairs folks serious bargaining power. Your fellow Americans can now be hired more easily than ever before, without you incurring any of the burdens of an employer. Sure, the resulting volatility may drive some of them to places like Dee\u2019s Tots, but that is beyond your view.Stairs are built so we do not have to see.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Irish Rebellion Over Water", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDUBLIN \u2014 In the west of Ireland, they say that if you can see the mountain, it\u2019s going to rain. And if you can\u2019t see the mountain? It\u2019s raining.Ireland may have its troubles, but drought isn\u2019t one of them. Which may be why proposed charges for household water have brought tens of thousands into the streets in protests that have deeply unnerved the political order.If the Irish are finally catching the mood of anti-austerity anger that has been rolling across much of the European Union, it may be a case not so much of the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back as the drop that caused the dam to burst.All of this has happened with a great deal of private grumbling but only sporadic public protest. In a general election in 2011, the center-right party blamed for the collapse was kicked out and replaced by a coalition led by another, almost identical, center-right party. The new government accepted and implemented the same conditions of stark austerity that had been imposed on the old one by the I.M.F. and the European Union.If you were looking at Ireland from European Union headquarters in Brussels or from the European Central Bank\u2019s offices in Frankfurt, this made the country an island of comfort in a sea of political turbulence. The European establishment is under siege from both left and right.Greece has its left-wing opposition party, Syriza, within striking distance of taking power in next year\u2019s elections. Spain\u2019s populist protest movement Podemos has gathered impressive pace. France\u2019s post-fascist National Front is polling strongly.Even in Britain, the right-wing anti-European U.K. Independence Party is causing panic among the traditional ruling parties. Ireland\u2019s apparent passivity suggested that these storms might blow over, that familiar political landscapes could survive Europe\u2019s long, deep recession.For the first time since 2008, the Irish government was able this autumn to bring in a largely neutral budget, without broad tax increases or spending cuts. Dublin\u2019s streets are full of Christmas shoppers. Its property market is almost as buoyant, with rapidly rising house prices easing some of the pain of the vast mortgages inherited from the years of the Celtic Tiger bubble.So why are the Irish, who have taken years of punishment, suddenly in such a rage? It\u2019s not just outsiders who are asking this question.But the most popular political option in recent polls is, essentially, \u201cnone of the above.\u201d Almost a third of the electorate says it will vote for nonparty or micro-party candidates.This is a rare case of change actually falling from the sky. The catalyst for this transformation is plain old water.As, indeed, it is. The current Irish political ferment is really a case of \u201cadd water and stir vigorously\u201d to get a whole mess of trouble. All the ingredients for mass dissatisfaction were already present \u2014 they just needed something to bring them together.There is a deep sense of injustice at being turned into one of the most indebted nations on earth in order to rescue international bondholders who gambled on rogue Irish banks. There is the way the pain has been inflicted most deeply on the poorest people \u2014 the last four government budgets have been regressive, hitting those on the lowest incomes hardest. There is the bitterness of yet again having to export the country\u2019s greatest asset: its talented, highly educated young people.Above all, there\u2019s the gap between the Irish story and the Irish experience. The story is upbeat \u2014 austerity works. The experience is rather different. The impressive G.D.P. figures are at least partly unreal, boosted by the accounting practices of Irish-based multinationals.Unemployment remains very high, and the figures would be much worse if people were not emigrating. Household debt in Ireland is still the second highest in Europe relative to disposable incomes, which have not improved.Perhaps, in the end, there\u2019s a religious aspect to it all. The Irish largely accepted austerity because they believed they had sinned and deserved to be punished. But the converse was that, having been good for so long, they should be rewarded.They didn\u2019t expect heaven to be a place where it rains all the time and the angels charge you for a drink of water.Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist for The\nIrish Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID POSTThe founder and managing director of New York law and corporate-restructuring firm Lindenwood Associates has always made a point of taking a week off from work for year-end holidays \u2014 plus two weeks in the summer and a week in the spring \u2014 to spend time with his wife and two children, now 18 and 15. \u201cThe real joy of spending unadulterated time with family is that I get to experience the little things that I usually miss \u2014 that just come and go \u2014 during your normal daily routine,\u201d he says. For this busy boss, carving out time for family is difficult. After work, he has just enough time to have dinner with his wife and kids and get a quick recap of everyone\u2019s day. It\u2019s only on his days off that he gets to spend quality time with his loved ones. It\u2019s a similar story for most working people in the U.S. Whether you\u2019re a middle manager, a serial entrepreneur or a health-care worker, Americans don\u2019t have enough time to be with their families. It\u2019s only on vacation that we enjoy the luxury of leisure \u2014 the ability to spend a block of uninterrupted time with family and friends. Yet most of us don\u2019t even use all of the vacation days we're entitled to. A February 2014 report by Oxford Economics found that a quarter of American workers don\u2019t get any paid vacation, and those whose jobs do include paid time off leave 3.2 days of vacation on the table, on average. It's perhaps not surprising, then, that only half of Americans have planned a vacation or been on one in 2014, according to a survey by MasterCard.If people did take all those days off \u2014 or even just one more than they currently do \u2014 Americans would be a happier bunch, says Wasserstein. \u201cGoing away with my family is one of the most important things I do,\u201d he says. \u201cMy life would be a lot less fulfilling if I wasn\u2019t able to take time out with my kids.\u201dOf the 1,000 or so parents who participated in the survey, three-quarters agreed that the family is more relaxed while on vacation. They also reported that their families eat twice as many meals together during those times. And while they considered less than half of family time at home \u201cquality time,\u201d that share rose to 82 percent when the family on break together. The Kelton Global survey also found that 78 percent of Americans would give up their favorite TV show to spend just one more hour with their children every week, while 71 percent of parents said they would love to spend nine more hours with their kids every week. Lisa Orndoff, manager of employee relations and engagement at the Society for Human Resource Management (S.H.R.M.), isn\u2019t surprised by these numbers. From talking to employees, she knows that most would love to spend more time with their families. \u201cI hear a lot of things, like they\u2019re going to miss soccer games, or they\u2019ve missed the last recital and don\u2019t want to miss this one,\u201d she says. Work- and home-life often come into conflict: \u201cThere\u2019s more pressure to be a present parent and also to deal with our crazy work schedules.\u201dIf vacations are one of the few times people can unplug and be fully present with their loved ones, why don\u2019t employees take their allotted time off? Oxford Economics found that 40 percent of employees don\u2019t take all of their vacation days because they have too much work to do. If they take a break, they worry about how that work will get done and what their employer will think of them if they don\u2019t complete their projects. That must-work attitude has only gotten worse since the recession, says Evren Esen, S.H.R.M.\u2019s director of survey programs. Companies are operating with tight budgets and lean staffs, which means employees are expected to do a lot more with fewer resources. \u201cThey may feel that if they go on vacation, they\u2019ll get too far behind,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they have to catch up when they get back, they might wonder if it\u2019s even worthwhile to leave.\u201dBut taking a family vacation isn\u2019t just good for families. It\u2019s also an essential boost for America\u2019s economy. Oxford Economics found that if we all took every vacation day available to us, it would spur $67 billion more in additional spending and roughly 288 million additional travel days. Add in family members to the mix and more than 580 million additional travel days would be generated.If more people traveled, industries well beyond familiar travel players would feel the economic lift too. Air carriers, restaurants and hotels would be direct beneficiaries, but the Oxford Economics report also found that travel stimulates demand for services \u2014 such as travel agents, legal help and financial planners \u2014 along with spending on everything from cameras to clothes to entertainment and food. Taken together this fillip to spending would result in an even larger gain: roughly $160 billion in incremental business sales across the U.S., as well as $52 billion in additional wage income. Longer and more consistent vacationing would also add some 1.2 million jobs as companies hire staff to fill in for vacationing employees, while other businesses add workers to serve those vacationers. It\u2019s partly for this reason that John Schmitt, an economist at Washington\u2019s Centre for Economic & Policy Research, thinks America should mandate paid time off. Currently, there are no U.S. laws requiring paid vacation to be offered or taken. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on vacation, you spend money in a different way than when you\u2019re at work,\u201d he says. \u201cMany industries would benefit from more time off.\u201dIn some ways, American culture is holding us back, says Tony Schwartz, president and chief executive of The Energy Group, a Yonkers, N.Y.-based company that works with businesses to create a healthier and happier workplace. A \u201cwork until you drop\u201d attitude is pervasive in many organizations, Schwartz says. This way of thinking persists even as study after study confirms that taking time off makes people more productive as well as much happier and far less stressed. According to a 2013 S.H.R.M. report, 74 percent of human resource managers said that employees who take vacation have higher levels of job satisfaction, and 72 percent are more productive. Oxford Economics found that 60 percent of employees feel better mentally after a vacation, and 59 percent said taking time off improved their family lives. Orndoff has seen firsthand how much more relaxed employees are after spending time away with family. \u201cIt creates space in their heads,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople get breathing room. They get to experience different things, and they\u2019re re-energized when they come back to work.\u201dWith Wasserstein\u2019s oldest child now away at college, his vacation time is, in some ways, even more precious than it was before. Now vacation-time the only period when the entire family gets to spend a chunk of days in each other\u2019s company. If Wasserstein has his way, he\u2019ll be taking family vacations, even as his kids have their own families, for many years to come. \u201cI\u2019m going to put all of my energy into trying to make these trips happen,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, though, the kids have a lot of other things to do rather than go on vacation with their parents. I\u2019ll just have to make our trips even more interesting.\u201d The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Being Bad Europeans", "Date": "2014-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy is Europe in such dire straits? The conventional wisdom among European policy makers is that we\u2019re looking at the price of irresponsibility: Some governments have failed to behave with the prudence a shared currency requires, choosing instead to pander to misguided voters and cling to failed economic doctrines. And if you ask me (and a number of other economists who have looked hard at the issue), this analysis is essentially right, except for one thing: They\u2019ve got the identity of the bad actors wrong.For the bad behavior at the core of Europe\u2019s slow-motion disaster isn\u2019t coming from Greece, or Italy, or France. It\u2019s coming from Germany.I\u2019m not denying that the Greek government behaved irresponsibly before the crisis, or that Italy has a big problem with stagnating productivity. But Greece is a small country whose fiscal mess is unique, while Italy\u2019s long-run problems aren\u2019t the source of Europe\u2019s deflationary downdraft. If you try to identify countries whose policies were way out of line before the crisis and have hurt Europe since the crisis, and that refuse to learn from experience, everything points to Germany as the worst actor.Consider, in particular, the comparison between Germany and France.France gets a lot of bad press, with much talk in particular about its supposed loss in competitiveness. Such talk greatly exaggerates the reality; you\u2019d never know from most media reports that France runs only a small trade deficit. Still, to the extent that there is an issue here, where does it come from? Has French competitiveness been eroded by excessive growth in costs and prices?In other words, to the extent that there\u2019s anything like a competitiveness problem in Europe, it\u2019s overwhelmingly caused by Germany\u2019s beggar-thy-neighbor policies, which are in effect exporting deflation to its neighbors.But what about debt? Isn\u2019t non-German Europe paying the price for past fiscal irresponsibility? Actually, that\u2019s a story about Greece and nobody else. And it\u2019s especially wrong in the case of France, which isn\u2019t facing a fiscal crisis at all; France can currently borrow long-term at a record low interest rate of less than 1 percent, only slightly above the German rate.What we\u2019re seeing, then, is the immensely destructive power of bad ideas. It\u2019s not entirely Germany\u2019s fault \u2014 Germany is a big player in Europe, but it\u2019s only able to impose deflationary policies because so much of the European elite has bought into the same false narrative.

The Lima Accord, as it is known, is the first time that all nations \u2014 rich and poor \u2014 have agreed to cut back on the burning oil, gas and coal.But the driving force behind the new deal was not the threat of sanctions or other legal consequences. It was global peer pressure. And over the coming months, it will start to become evident whether the scrutiny of the rest of the world is enough to pressure world leaders to push through new global warming laws from New Delhi to Moscow or if, as a political force, international reproach is impotent.The strength of the accord \u2014 the fact that it includes pledges by every country to put forward a plan to reduce emissions at home \u2014 is also its greatest weakness. In order to get every country to agree to the deal, including the United States, the world\u2019s largest historic carbon polluter, the Lima Accord does not include legally binding requirements that countries cut their emissions by any particular amount.Instead, each nation will agree to enact domestic laws to reduce carbon emissions and put forth a plan by March 31 laying out how much each one will cut after 2020 and what domestic policies it will pass to achieve the cuts.By asking countries to put forward plans dictated by their own economies and domestic politics, rather than a top-down mandate, the Lima Accord helped secure the agreement of every nation to some kind of carbon-cutting action, experts say.But with no language requiring the significant cuts scientists say are needed to stave off the costly effects of global warming, countries can put forth weak plans that amount to little more than business as usual. Countries can even choose to ignore the deal and submit no plan at all.\u201cIf a country doesn\u2019t submit a plan, there will be no punishment, no fine, no black U.N. helicopters showing up,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, an expert on climate negotiations with the World Resources Institute, a research organization.Instead the architects of the plan, including top White House officials, hope that the agreement will compel countries to act to avoid international condemnation.\u201cIt relies on a lot of peer pressure,\u201d Ms. Morgan said.The structure of the deal is what political scientists often call a \u201cname-and-shame\u201d plan.Under the Lima Accord all countries must submit plans that would be posted on a United Nations website and made available to the public.A requirement that all countries submit plans using identical metrics, for easy comparison, was deleted from the accord because of the objection of developing nations.\u201cWhat\u2019s essential for naming and shaming is that the individual contributions be comparable,\u201d said Robert Stavins, a professor of Environmental Economics at Harvard University.But already, a number of research groups and universities expect to crunch the numbers of the plans, producing apples-to-apples assessments. The hope, negotiators said, is that as the numbers and commitments of each country are publicized, compared and discussed, countries will be shamed by the spotlight into proposing and enacting stronger plans.\u201cWe see the sunlight as one of the most important parts of this,\u201d said Todd D. Stern, the senior climate-change negotiator for President Obama.The motivations of the world leaders and whether they care about those assessments are essential to the success of the deal.Mr. Obama wants to sign on to the plan because he sees his role in fighting climate change as a cornerstone of his legacy, both he and his advisers say. But whether the United States will follow through on his commitment depends on whether his successors and fellow politicians feel the same.The president has pledged that the United States will cut emissions by as much as 28 percent by 2025. The nation can achieve some of that under new regulations of tailpipe and power plant emissions enacted by his administration.But further laws or regulations, enacted after Mr. Obama leaves office, must be put in place for the United States to meet its pledge, experts say. Most in the emerging field of Republican presidential contenders have come out fiercely against Mr. Obama\u2019s domestic climate-change policies, and they may not be swayed by international scorn if the United States does not follow through on its Lima pledge.But China was driven to cut pollution largely to quell domestic unrest, as citizens protested against the increasingly bad air caused by coal power production. The previous decade of international criticism, as China surpassed the United States as the world\u2019s largest polluter, did not compel it to take domestic action.There is much speculation about how India, the world\u2019s third largest carbon polluter, will respond. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared repeatedly that his top priority is economic growth and lifting people out of poverty, even if that means the construction of hundreds of new coal-fired power plants to deliver cheap electricity. Mr. Modi is also seen wanting to resist being viewed as caving in to pressure from Mr. Obama.In New Delhi, critics have already begun pushing back against the deal.\u201cThe burden of tackling climate change will decisively shift to developing countries, making their efforts toward poverty reduction and sustainable development difficult and expensive,\u201d said Sunita Narain, director of the Centre of Science and Environment, an Indian advocacy group.However, India\u2019s environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, noted last week in Lima that climate change has already affected his nation, and that his government intends to submit a plan by June that would show how India would lower the rate at which it produces pollution.Observers are also closely watching Russia, the world\u2019s fifth-largest polluter, for its response to the plan. President Vladimir V. Putin has publicly scoffed at the science of human-caused climate change and shown a willingness to defy international opinion.But this week in Lima, Russian delegates said that Moscow is at work on an emissions reduction plan.Climate change policy observers will also closely watch Australia. This year, the Australian government voted to repeal a carbon tax, and the administration of Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also eliminated its Department of Climate Change. On Sunday morning in Lima, as delegates from around the world praised the passage of the Lima Accord, the Australian delegation chose not to make remarks.Still, the delegation did say it will submit a climate change plan to the United Nations this spring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Government Spending on Construction Edges Up", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsGOVERNMENT construction spending \u2014 on such things as roads, schools and sewage plants \u2014 is finally on the rise again.The Census Bureau reported this week that the federal, state and local governments spent $271.1 billion on construction projects during the 12 months through October, 0.3 percent more than in the previous 12 months. Among the largest categories of public spending on building, spending was up for roads and other transportation projects, as well as on sewers and waste disposal plants. But spending on school construction was lower than in the previous year, as was spending on water projects and public safety.As can be seen from the accompanying charts \u2014 which begin at the end of 2007, as the Great Recession began \u2014 public construction spending appeared to be holding up at first, although that was in part because of the lags between decisions on spending and the actual spending. In addition, projects that are started are likely to be finished, even if in retrospect beginning the project no longer seems to have been a wise decision.Construction spending by state and local governments peaked in 2009 and soon began to decline as budget constraints took hold, but federal spending soared as the Obama administration tried to stimulate the stumbling economy. Federal construction spending climbed to $31.1 billion in 2010, more than 50 percent higher than the 2007 figure, and stayed close to that level in 2011. But it began to decline in 2012, as pressures built to hold down spending.The recent growth in government construction spending has come from a revival in state and local government projects. Federal construction spending shows scant signs of recovery, although it remains above prerecession levels.On a year-over-year basis, total 12-month public construction spending fell continually from early 2010 through August of this year. October was the second month to show a year-over-year increase. The figures are not adjusted for inflation.Among the categories of public construction spending shown in the accompanying charts, it was spending on public safety construction that rose the fastest early in the recession. Much of that increase went to spending for local police and sheriffs, including jails. Almost none of it went to spending for fire stations.There was also a large increase in transportation spending \u2014 an area that includes airports, marinas and railroads. The much larger area of streets and highways grew at a much lower rate, as did spending on schools.But spending on public safety construction has since retreated, and in the most recent 12 months was lower than it was before the recession. The same is true of spending on water and sewage plants. Spending on education \u2014 largely school construction \u2014 remains more than 20 percent below 2007 levels. Spending on transportation projects, and on streets and highways, remains at or near record levels, at least before inflation is taken into account.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cheaper Oil, Fatter Wallets and a National Opportunity ", "Date": "2014-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesOil prices have plunged so rapidly that financial markets are treating them less as an opportunity than a danger, like a falling knife. Currency rates are gyrating, oil-producing countries like Russia, Venezuela and Iran are hurting, and sectors of the bond market are threatened. But unless you\u2019re directly involved in the commodity markets, you may not be following the futures price of a barrel of oil. What hits home, especially if you drive a car with an internal combustion engine, is the price of gasoline: It has become spectacularly cheap.Even in New York City, where gas prices are among the highest in the continental United States, drivers are beginning to smile. On average, a gallon of regular costs less than $3 within the city limits, according to the AAA. Painful as this may be for wildcatters in North Dakota and Texas \u2014 as well as oil companies in Siberia, Latin America and the Persian Gulf \u2014 it\u2019s an immediate boon for hard-pressed American consumers: We\u2019ve got more money to spend, and, based on history, we\u2019ll spend it. The only big question is whether \u2014 during this particular energy cycle \u2014 we will devote some of the windfall to items with long-term benefits, like repair and redevelopment of our battered infrastructure and measures to conserve the environment.But there is little doubt that low gas prices lead to extra spending across the economy. In fact, there are signs that some of that spending has already started. When gas prices break below a three-year trading range and then fall significantly lower, as they already have, people start to feel better about spending, Professor Hamilton said.\u201cWhen prices drop, that should stimulate demand, and I think that\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. The latest reports on retail sales, vehicle sales and consumer confidence have all been strong, he said, and \u201cthe fall in gas prices is a big part of it.\u201dThat should have an effect on the entire domestic economy. Despite the surge in American production that has contributed to the glut in supply and the fall in prices, the United States remains a net oil-consuming nation. That\u2019s why the overall effect of falling oil prices should be positive for the United States \u2014 and harmful for net-producing nations like Russia \u2014 although it is hard to calculate the actual numbers. For the United States, which is both a big producer and consumer of oil, some of the positives and negatives would balance out, resulting in a net addition of roughly one percentage point to annual G.D.P. The true number is debatable, but it\u2019s clear that there will be a boost. And in a period like this, in which the economy has already picked up steam, it opens up some policy options. Several factors have contributed to the price declines. An increase in oil production, especially in the United States, is part of the story, but so is a reduction in global demand.In addition, conservation efforts worldwide, including fuel-efficiency standards in the United States, have contributed to slackening demand and falling prices. We simply don\u2019t burn as much energy as we did a few years ago to achieve the same amount of mileage, heat or manufacturing production. But when prices drop, we run into a basic economic problem that could reverse some of these improvements in energy efficiency and conservation. With lower prices, demand rises and people consume more. Bargain gas prices induce people to hit the road. The AAA projects that during the year-end holiday period, people will drive 4 percent more than they did during the period last year. They also may be tempted to buy bigger, gas-guzzling vehicles. That\u2019s happened before.Certainly, if these trends continue as expected, fuel consumption will increase while the more expensive forms of oil production, now rendered less economical, will decline. With less supply and more demand, energy prices can be expected to rise again. We could be back, more or less, where we started.Professor Hamilton pointed out that a carbon tax of $25 a ton \u2014 which the Obama administration has advocated, but Congress has opposed \u2014 converts to less than the amount that oil and gas prices have already fallen. A carbon tax wouldn\u2019t be painful right now, but it would provide an incentive for energy efficiency. There\u2019s another economically interesting option. The nation\u2019s bridges, highways and mass transit systems are in dire need of a big infusion of capital \u2014 and a major source of such money, the national Highway Trust Fund, which relies on gasoline taxes for revenue, is nearly depleted.

{"Headline": "Eurozone\u2019s Finance Ministers Extend Greek Bailout Program", "Date": "2014-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Greece won a two-month extension of its international bailout program at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Monday, a decision with financial and political implications.The extension is critical for Athens because without it, money from the European component of its loan program would have dried up at the end of this year. Money that has been pledged separately by the International Monetary Fund was already set to continue being dispensed through March 2016.The government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is under increasing pressure from political opponents, most notably the leftist Syriza party, which have appealed to popular resentment about the state of the Greek economy.Monday\u2019s decision means Greece can take a few more weeks to complete negotiations with its troika of international creditors \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the I.M.F. \u2014 on economic changes the lenders have required in exchange for bailout loans.Since 2010, those creditors have agreed to 240 billion euros ($295 billion) in loans to Greece, which required a rescue after its economy collapsed under a mountain of debt.Finance ministers from the 18-country euro currency union, of which Greece is a member, agreed to a \u201ctechnical extension\u201d of two months for the Greek bailout program, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, told a news conference.The decision should give some national parliaments including the German Bundestag time to consider approving plans for a precautionary credit line, which Greece could tap next year if it is unsuccessful in returning to the financial markets to borrow money.The Brussels meeting followed a budget vote in Athens in the early hours of Monday by the Greek Parliament, which narrowly approved spending for 2015. The budget forecasts extensive tax cuts and a solid return to growth, which Mr. Samaras said signaled Greece\u2019s gradual emergence from six punishing years of recession.Political tensions are high in Greece before a presidential election, which had been expected by February. But on Monday evening, after the European decision to grant Greece a bailout extension, a government spokeswoman said the elections would move forward, with the first round to begin Dec. 17.Before the budget vote, thousands of Greeks had joined a peaceful gathering outside the Parliament building to protest the austerity policies of successive governments, which have led to household incomes\u2019 being slashed by one-third and unemployment rising to 26 percent. The austerity budgets have been largely imposed by Greece\u2019s international lenders, as a condition of the country\u2019s continuing to receive bailout loans.In a speech to Parliament before the budget vote, Mr. Samaras said the blueprint, the first balanced budget in decades, signaled Greece\u2019s gradual return to health.\u201cWe are leading the country to a new era where we can offer relief,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are reducing the deficit to zero.\u201dThe political situation in Greece made it crucial that Europe approve the extension, although the timing is tricky.Mr. Samaras\u2019s government, while seeking the extension, did not want it to continue too long, on fears that the extra time would give political opponents, especially Syriza, ammunition to argue that the government remains beholden to foreign creditors. At most, the government had hoped for a few weeks beyond Dec. 31.Eurozone officials, though, favored a longer period to ensure oversight of Greece amid political uncertainty. Elections to form a new government could potentially come soon after the presidential election, if Mr. Samaras\u2019s party cannot win enough seats in Parliament.The decision for a two-month extension \u201cis really the wisest,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for fiscal and monetary policy, said at the Brussels news conference.But Mujtaba Rahman, the director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, an international risk consultant group, said the timing of the extension was unlikely to have much effect on Greek politics. \u201cThe two-month extension is not going to fundamentally change the picture in Greece,\u201d Mr. Rahman predicted. \u201cSyriza is still coming to power next year.\u201dThe Greek government spokeswoman, Sofia Voultepsi, described the bailout extension as \u201ca very positive development\u201d but said the \u201cnext period is critical.\u201d The Greek authorities must now focus on the troika talks, she said, and stop the opposition from propelling political instability.Mr. Samaras has been seeking to build his credibility as a leader able to regain the country\u2019s autonomy, part of his attempts to beat back Syriza, which has been gaining popularity. But his tactics badly rattled the financial markets, driving up Greek borrowing costs. That reawakened concerns that Greece would not be able to pay its bills.On Monday, Alexis Tsipras, the Syriza leader, accused the government of planning more austerity measures after years of painful cuts to salaries and pensions.The budget passed the Greek Parliament by a vote of 155 to 134 in the 300-seat House.The budget assumes that the Greek economy, which has shrunk by one-quarter in the last five years, will expand by 2.9 percent in 2015. The spending plan also promises relief \u2014 most notably, 30 percent reductions in an income tax surcharge and a tax on heating oil.But the budget has not been formally approved by Greece\u2019s international creditors, for whom a crucial source of contention is a projected budget gap for next year. The creditors forecast that the government will miss its deficit target, which would oblige authorities in Athens to make an estimated \u20ac2.5 billion in additional cuts.The troika is also pushing for Greece to impose additional economic changes, including a second overhaul of the pension system and revoking workers\u2019 rights.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the coming election cycle in Greece. It is a presidential election, not a general one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Martha McSally, Republican Challenger, Wins in Arizona Midterm Race", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Election officials in Arizona said Wednesday that the last undecided congressional race from the midterm elections had been won by a Republican challenger who edged out the Democratic incumbent by just 167 votes.The district includes much of the area that had been represented by Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat, who was shot in the head in January 2011 while holding a meet-and-greet with constituents in the Tucson area. Mr. Barber, who was an aide to Ms. Giffords, also attended the event and was shot in the face and thigh. In 2012, he won a seat in the House in a special election to finish her term. Months later, in the general election, he beat Ms. McSally to represent the newly redrawn district.But in the rematch election last month, Mr. Barber came up 161 votes behind Ms. McSally, triggering the recount because a 200-vote margin was needed for a clear-cut win.The result of the recount adds to the commanding majority for the Republican Party in the House of Representatives, with the party holding 247 seats when the new Congress convenes in January.\u201cThere\u2019s no getting around that this was an incredibly close and hard-fought race,\u201d Ms. McSally said in a statement, adding, \u201cAfter what\u2019s been a long campaign season, it\u2019s time to come together and heal our community.\u201d She listed the economy and national security as top priorities as she takes office.After the November vote, Ms. McSally had declared victory \u2014 even with the looming recount \u2014 and left for Washington to attend freshman orientation. A 26-year veteran of the Air Force who rose to the rank of colonel, Ms. McSally has already been appointed to serve on the House Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees come January.In the weeks after the election, Mr. Barber challenged the results, including pursuing a lawsuit to count 133 votes that had been disqualified. That bid was rejected by a judge. On Wednesday, however, Mr. Barber accepted his defeat and promised a \u201csmooth transition.\u201d\u201cThis result is not the one we hoped for, but we take solace in having spoken out loud and clear for the principle that every legal vote should be counted,\u201d Mr. Barber said in a statement. \u201cWhen an election is as close as this one has been, we do our best to arrive at the correct result, and then accept it with respect for the voters.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Steep Rate Increase Fails to Stem Ruble\u2019s Decline", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Despite the Russian central bank\u2019s extraordinary move to defend the currency, the ruble\u2019s value continued to slide on Tuesday, presenting President Vladimir V. Putin with an acute set of political and economic challenges.Scenes that Russians hoped had receded into the past reappeared on the streets. Currency exchange signs blinked ever-changing digits. Russians rushed to appliance stores to buy washing machines or televisions to unload rubles. Unsure of prices, car dealerships like Volvo in Russia halted business, while Apple stopped online sales in the country.After a middle-of-the night interest rate hike, a sense of economic chaos settled over the Russian capital. The ruble was in free fall, dropping under 80 rubles to the dollar, after opening the day at 64 to the dollar.\u201cWe are seeing an economic crisis,\u201d Natalia V. Akindinova, a professor at the Higher School of Economics, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe are seeing a sharp devaluation of the ruble at a time when the central bank doesn\u2019t have the reserves to influence the market, as it did in the past crises.\u201dThe Russian economy is getting battered by the painful combination of Western sanctions and low oil prices. The country is expected to fall into a recession next year.Global investors are increasingly concerned that tumult in Russia might not be isolated. Many emerging markets like Venezuela and Nigeria are dependent on their energy exports, which are being hurt by the deep and sustained decline in oil prices. Oil is now trading at around $55 a barrel, compared to more than $100 a barrel this summer.Emerging markets are also under pressure as the Federal Reserve in the United States shifts strategy. Some countries like Turkey and South Africa have depended heavily on external financing to aid their growth. They have been hurt by expectations that the Fed would raise rates.\u201cThere is country-specific risk for Russia that\u2019s not going to go away,\u201d said \u200bPhyllis Papadavid, a foreign exchange strategist at BNP Paribas in London. \u201cBut there\u2019s a larger story.\u201dIn Russia, investors are growing increasingly worried that the Kremlin has in effect decided to print money to address a growing debt problem. Traders are also raising concern that the cronyism and opaque insider dealings that have plagued business here have now spread to monetary policy.According to analysts, the ruble\u2019s fall on Monday was sparked by word of an opaque deal involving the central bank and the state-controlled oil company, Rosneft. The well-connected business executive running the company, Igor I. Sechin, a longtime associate of Mr. Putin, had apparently persuaded the central bank to effectively issue billions of new rubles to his company to help cover debts.The governor of the central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, speaking on Russian television, said the interest rate decision had been made to stanch the fall of the ruble. In its moves, the Russian central bank also increased allotments of dollars to the Russian banking system to finance the purchase of rubles as part of the effort to stabilize the currency.\u201cWe have to learn to live in a different zone, to orient ourselves more toward our own sources of financing,\u201d she said. In her televised remarks, Ms. Nabiullina said Russia would not resort to capital controls to stem the ruble\u2019s fall.But traders have long fretted that Ms. Nabiullina, a former economy minister, lacked the political spine to stand up to Mr. Putin or his longtime allies like Mr. Sechin. And yet, though the absence of any credible independence by the central bank is at the heart of the ruble crisis today, it is unclear any figure in Russia could provide it given the ever more authoritarian nature of Mr. Putin\u2019s rule.Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former finance minister, wrote on Twitter that \u201cthe fall of the ruble and the stock market is not just a reaction to the low price of oil and to sanctions, but also due to a lack of confidence in the government\u2019s economic policy.\u201dIn the oil boom years, the government of Mr. Putin assumed an ever-larger role in the economy. Longtime associates of Mr. Putin\u2019s from his hometown, St. Petersburg, or from his years in the Soviet KGB intelligence agency took the helms of huge new state-owned enterprises. All the while, the central bank and a liberal wing of economic policy advisers kept aloof from this politically driven divvying up of assets.Now, market sentiment is shifting. A continued fall in the value of the ruble could present Mr. Putin with difficult choices and could make it more difficult to sustain the political support he has enjoyed at home even as his relations with the West have frayed.He faces a particularly delicate dance with Russian companies, which are under significant financing strains. Russian corporations and banks are scheduled to repay $30 billion in foreign loans this month.And next year, about $130 billion will be due. There is no obvious source for these hard currency payments other than the central bank, whose credibility is now being called into question.Rosneft, for example, had been clamoring for months for a government bailout to refinance debt the company ran up while making acquisitions when oil prices were high. Because of sanctions, those loans cannot be rolled over with Western banks. Debt payments are coming due later this month.Relying only on the company\u2019s own cash reserves would disrupt oil development projects that Russia is relying on for future revenue. With the oil giant in a bind, the central bank ruled that it would accept Rosneft bonds held by commercial banks as collateral for loans.Rosneft issued 625 billion rubles about $10.9 billion at the exchange rate at the time, in new bonds on Friday. The identities of the buyers were not publicly disclosed, but analysts say that large state banks bought the issue.When these banks deposit the bonds with the central bank in exchange for loans, Rosneft will have been financed, in effect, with an emission of rubles from the central bank. The deal roiled the ruble on Monday, according to analysts.The reason for Monday\u2019s currency crash is \u201cwell known,\u201d Boris Y. Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister who is now in the political opposition, wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cThe central bank started the printing press to help the Sechin-Putin business, and gave Rosneft 625 billion newly printed rubles. The money immediately appeared on the currency market, and the rate collapsed.\u201d Rosneft, in a statement, denied it had exchanged funds raised from the bonds for hard currency.\u201cThis is a result of aggression and insanity in foreign policy, which led to sanctions,\u201d Mr. Nemtsov wrote of the ruble\u2019s collapse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Retail Makeover in Miami", "Date": "2014-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 A construction worker\u2019s hard hat tipped to a jaunty angle on his bald head, Craig Robins marched toward a cavernous, three-story space, raw with dusty building materials and cables poking from unfinished walls.Louis Vuitton\u2019s flagship store will stand just north of Valentino, and Van Cleef & Arpels to the south. Facing them will be Bulgari and Christian Dior. About 20 such top-drawer brands are set to open stores in the Design District this month, all in individual buildings along spotless walkways and streets, in the manner of Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, Fla., and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif.An additional 30 or so are scheduled to open during the first half of next year. And by the end of 2016, Mr. Robins plans to have about 120 high-end retail tenants in a 10-square-block radius, alongside restaurants, art galleries, a boutique hotel, sculptures, murals and 300 new trees, some perched on roofs. For decades, Bal Harbour was the only shopping center in the Miami area where customers were assured a wide choice of luxury goods. Now, it has lost some of retail\u2019s choicest names, including Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s, Cartier, Emilio Pucci, Givenchy and several others, to the Design District.In Miami and its environs, a thumping economy is continuing to animate a construction boom. And in the once-genteel business of luxury retail, it has spurred a no-holds-barred skirmish for the attentions of the approximately 14 million people who arrive every year, many of them cash-wielding visitors from Latin America, Russia and Western Europe, and the five million people who live here and in the surrounding area, including Broward and Palm Beach counties.\u201cSeventy percent of the retail sales in Miami are to visitors from Latin America,\u201d said Deborah Overholt, Brickell City Centre\u2019s retail leasing director. \u201cTheir No. 1 priority is luxury. That\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for.\u201dIn 2012, she said, visitors staying at hotels in the Brickell area alone \u2014 which includes the Mandarin Oriental and the Four Seasons \u2014 spent $800 million on shopping in and around Miami. The Brickell City Centre, she said, will cater to that clientele. As for the Design District, Ms. Overholt said she was not concerned that it might pull away a hefty amount of business long before Brickell City can open its doors.\u201cWe feel that high tides float all boats,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s better for everyone if we\u2019re all successful.\u201dLocal developers and shopkeepers seem unperturbed, at least for now, about warnings in the recent quarterly reports from many high-end brands. \u201cMost of the negative financial issues in the luxury market are in China and Europe,\u201d Mr. Robins said. \u201cThis causes worldwide numbers to be down. But business in the U.S. remains robust, increasing the importance of the Miami market.\u201dMatthew W. Lazenby, the 37-year-old president and chief executive of Whitman Family Development, Bal Harbour\u2019s parent company, seemed equally untroubled. \u201cOver the years, Bal Harbour Shops has proven to be largely defiant in terms of bucking prevailing trends, even in the luxury sector,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tend to think in terms of decades, not quarters, so we are somewhat intentionally oblivious to flash-in-the-pan trends.\u201dYet Bal Harbour\u2019s long hegemony over Miami\u2019s top-tier retail market has faltered, apparently, at least in part because of its own rules.For decades, Bal Harbour leases stipulated that if tenants opened stores elsewhere in South Florida, percentages of their sales had to be kicked back to Bal Harbour\u2019s owners, the Whitman family. To some leaseholders, it amounted to a prohibition on unfettered commerce.In the last three years, frustrated tenants \u2014 most notably brands owned by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods giant \u2014 began packing up their Bal Harbour stores and moving out, many of them to temporary quarters in the Design District while new flagship stores were built.\u201cThey just got greedy with their monopoly,\u201d Jackie Soffer, a principal in the family-owned Aventura Mall, said of Bal Harbour\u2019s owners. \u201cMiami is just too big a city for that.\u201d Mr. Lazenby conceded in an interview that some \u201cbad blood\u201d remained in the wake of the leases\u2019 so-called radius clause. \u201cWe did have a firm stance in the past, but we\u2019re not taking that stance anymore,\u201d said the executive, whose grandfather, Stanley F. Whitman, built the shops in 1965. \u201cWe frankly learned a lot from all this.\u201dDespite the desertions, Bal Harbour Shops remains a significant force. In 2012, the International Council of Shopping Centers named it the world\u2019s most productive shopping center, based on average annual sales of $2,555 per square foot. Bal Harbour has since improved in that category, Mr. Lazenby said, citing a new figure of $2,912 for the 12-month period that ended in September.In what appears to be a display of confidence, Bal Harbour now is seeking approval of a $300 million expansion that will add roughly 300,000 square feet of store space, including a third department store to join Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. On a recent Saturday afternoon, Bal Harbour\u2019s parking lot was all but full as shoppers chatting in various languages ambled in and out of Balenciaga, Chanel, Harry Winston and some of the 100 or so other stores. Only a couple of shops on the top floor were boarded up, awaiting new tenants. On the ground floor, open to the sky and the palms, a trio of sleek, shiny Jaguars were lined up. \u201cWe lease vehicles to foreign nationals,\u201d a pamphlet said in Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and English.\u201cThis is still a destination,\u201d said Marquietta Buffaloe, a sales assistant at the Bal Harbour outpost of the South Florida chain Books & Books, where sales last year were up 7.5 percent over 2012.At least one Bal Harbour shopper was irked that, after 30 years, Louis Vuitton had left and opened stores in the Design District and Aventura. \u201cI hated it when that happened,\u201d said Ana Fernandez, who lives on Keystone Point, less than three miles away. \u201cI liked it here. But it\u2019s not going to stop me from going to Louis Vuitton just because it\u2019s not here.\u201dStill, shopping at such places \u201cis not about the merchandise \u2014 it\u2019s about the ambience,\u201d Ms. Fernandez said. \u201cYou can get stuff anywhere.\u201dAmbience beyond shops and restaurants is one of the things Mr. Robins has in mind for the bustling, blocks-long construction site that is the Design District. An inveterate art collector, he described plans for a huge photographic mural by John Baldessari on the side of a parking garage, which will be visible to drivers on Interstate 195. It will be near a Manuel Clavel sculpture of cars attached vertically to the side of a building. And an enormous, circular sculptural piece by Buckminster Fuller called \u201cFly\u2019s Eye Dome\u201d is already installed in a square called the Palm Court.The project also will include a new home for the Institute of Contemporary Arts in a building that Mr. Robins, who began buying land in the area in the 1990s, donated for the purpose.Mr. Robins and his partners, who include a real-estate consortium in which LVMH is a minority stakeholder, recently sold a 20 percent share in the Design District development to a partnership of General Growth Properties and Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation, a transaction based on a valuation of $2 billion for the project \u2014 serious money even in a place replete with superlatives. \u201cSouth Florida is breaking all the rules,\u201d said James D. Tate, who invests in distressed commercial real-estate properties from his company\u2019s base in North Miami. Fresh off a deal to buy the 44-acre Bahia Mar Hotel and Marina Resort in Fort Lauderdale, Mr. Tate noted that booming economies have a way of playing out in cycles.\u201cThese faucets can turn off overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it happen before. Everything in South Florida seems to happen at a faster pace: We rebound faster than most economies around the country \u2014 and we also fall harder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Start-Up Strategies Evolve, So Does Role of a Business Plan", "Date": "2014-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySmall-Business GuideWhen Joanna Elkayam was laid off from a job selling bonds at Fidelity Investments in 2011, she had been working on a business plan for months. She wanted to open a spa with her husband, Avi, who already owned a successful hair salon.\u201cI got my M.B.A. from Boston University in 2008 and followed all the rules for writing that plan,\u201d Ms. Elkayam said. \u201cI even used my old textbooks. I wanted to get it right, especially because we needed to get a loan from our credit union, which had just started a loan program for start-ups.\u201dThe 150-page plan had enormous detail, she said, down to a description of the kinds of employees she wanted to hire and a code of conduct for them to follow.When the space next door to her husband\u2019s hair salon became available, Ms. Elkayam jumped on it. She left a copy of the business plan with a loan officer at the credit union and was interviewing employees when she learned the building where her spa was to be located had been sold. The tenants, including her husband\u2019s salon, were being given 30 days to leave.\u201cI was crushed,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like all those hours and hours of planning and writing had been a complete waste of time. I put the plan on a shelf in my home office and forgot about it.\u201dBusiness plans have historically been a necessity for most entrepreneurs, especially those seeking financing, but the definition of a business plan has changed in recent years. Today, it can mean anything from the traditional novellalike document Ms. Elkayam wrote, with market analysis and financial projections, to a one-page Venn diagram showing where markets overlap.And an increasing number of entrepreneurs have concluded that business plans take too long to write and become outdated too quickly. They skip the plan, which they consider an old economy relic, and go straight to market with a product or service, modifying their strategy in real time.That is especially true in the world of technology start-ups, where so-called lean start-ups focus on getting a minimum viable product, or an early, pared-down version of a product, out to early adopters and then readjusting based on feedback.Of course, most start-ups are not high-growth tech companies.He concluded that the business would need between three and six client companies and that he would approach only businesses in growing industries where he had experience and liked working. He created a website for the business and ordered high-quality, printed marketing materials that required a minimum run of 500 \u2014 far more than he needed.\u201cI still have 400 left today,\u201d Mr. Entin said, \u201cbut it was effective in demonstrating professionalism and instilling confidence in people who otherwise didn\u2019t know me or my young company.\u201d Today, he said, the company generates about $750,000 in revenue and bears a strong resemblance to the business he planned more than 10 years ago.About a year after Ms. Elkayam gave up on her idea to open a spa, she happened to spot her forgotten business plan in the trash on a day when her husband was cleaning out the office. They were in the process of formulating products for a beauty brand they wanted to introduce, featuring naturally derived, vegan and preservative-free products.For this venture, they had chosen to skip the business plan. \u201cI felt like all the work I did before had been wasted,\u201d Ms. Elkayam said. \u201cThose five-year projections? They never happened. And I was bitter about it.\u201dBusiness plans are not just for start-ups. They can be critical for businesses of all sizes and at all stages, Ms. Abrams said, because they help owners set goals and respond to changing conditions.\u201cI always emphasize that it\u2019s the planning that\u2019s most important, not the plan,\u201d she said. \u201cThe process of developing an annual plan should establish priorities for the coming year and become the basis for action.\u201dMs. Abrams recommends that businesses conduct an internal review of what worked in the previous year and what did not, what the goals were and how well the business met them. \u201cIt\u2019s important to eliminate things that aren\u2019t profitable or are shrinking your margins,\u201d she said.Private investors often require a plan as well, but there has been movement away from that. Rather than a written plan, investors and strategic partners often opt for a short video or PowerPoint presentation highlighting the main facts.\u201cBut they are still going to ask where you got your numbers and assumptions,\u201d Ms. Abrams said, \u201cso you need to know the answers even if you don\u2019t have a formal business plan at the time.\u201dJohn Sculley, former chief executive of Apple and president of PepsiCo and now a private investor in about 15 start-ups, said he was more interested in what he called a customer plan \u2014 hearing from the start-up\u2019s founders why a customer will want their particular product or service.\u201cIf they can\u2019t explain it through the eyes of a customer,\u201d Mr. Sculley said, \u201cthen I\u2019m not interested in investing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Housing Resists Efforts to Spur Market", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 In Dongguan, a sprawling factory city, one real estate developer has cut prices by 15 percent, offered $1,600 worth of free appliances and even brought in a circus and a traveling zoo to move apartments.In Hangzhou, the affluent hometown of the online retailer Alibaba, families that paid in advance for new apartments have occupied a stalled, half-finished complex.And in Changsha, a bustling river town where developers built a forest of fancy towers, a third of the modern office space is empty and families are mulling whether to buy in a weakening housing market or wait.Every urban real estate market is different in mainland China, driven by myriad municipal and provincial regulations and the varying strength of local economies. But the outcome is the same: The property market is under serious pressure.Prices for newly constructed housing fell 1 percent to 9 percent in recent months in all 70 mainland cities tracked by the national government, according to data released Thursday. Prices kept falling in November compared with October in all but three cities, where they were unchanged.Weak real estate prices are a major challenge for Beijing as it tries to manage an economic slowdown. The Chinese economy, which a few years ago was increasing at an annual 10 percent to 12 percent pace, is now growing at about 7 percent \u2014 a rate that President Xi Jinping described last month as \u201ca new normal of China\u2019s economy.\u201dThe government has already cut interest rates and authorized state-controlled banks to pump out more loans to prevent the economy from sagging even further, as the housing market has stalled.Real estate is vital. The International Monetary Fund estimated in October that construction and other real estate activities made up 12.8 percent of China\u2019s economic activity, and 33 percent if related activities are included, from making steel for building beams to manufacturing sinks for bathrooms.The fast-growing spending by Chinese households also depends in part on their confidence that home values are increasing. Nine-tenths of Chinese families own their homes, compared with about two-thirds in the United States.Yet real estate developers\u2019 inventories of unsold apartments now equal 12 to 18 months\u2019 worth of sales in China\u2019s biggest cities, like Beijing and Shanghai, according to Haitong Securities, a big Chinese brokerage firm and investment bank. The industry considers six months\u2019 worth of inventory to be healthy.Developers have responded by delaying new projects. In November, housing starts were down 34 percent from a year earlier.For real estate, \u201cthe winter has not come yet, but it is coming,\u201d said Hu Yifan, the chief economist for Haitong\u2019s international division.While the property market is under pressure, a crisis does not appear imminent. State-owned banks are reluctant to foreclose on borrowers in arrears, and few buyers are forced to sell at a loss.\u201cThere are always going to be cycles \u2014 in this country, more than others, the government controls those cycles,\u201d said Marty Burger, the chief executive of Silverstein Properties, which is planning a six-tower complex in Shenzhen, with apartments, offices, stores and hotel rooms. \u201cOver time, it\u2019s going to be a winner because of the growth of China.\u201dBut the real estate slump complicates policy-making for the government, which has to strike a tricky balance to prevent social unrest. It wants housing to be more affordable. Apartments in big cities now cost as much as 20 years\u2019 pay for recent college graduates. Even so, the government does not want to set off a slump in prices in a society where households have the vast bulk of their net worth in homes.The overall priority for regulators shifted this fall from making housing more affordable to halting further declines in prices.Regulators also reduced the required down payments. For buyers of second and third homes, they have dropped to 30 percent, from 60 percent to 70 percent. That is still steep by American standards, but manageable for many affluent urban families in China, which commonly save nearly half their incomes.The regulatory changes seem to be cushioning the fall in prices, but not reversing it. The pace at which prices are falling from month to month slowed slightly in two-thirds of Chinese cities in November. Among them was Changsha.A longtime center of chemical and rail manufacturing, Changsha seemed positioned to weather the gradual slowdown in economic growth. The opening of high-speed railroads over the past five years has made it an attractive, low-cost alternative for offices and factories.A construction worker on the site of Xinyuan Splendid, a property development in Changsha, China. Labor costs have risen nearly tenfold over the past decade, according to a spokesman for construction company.But developers overdid it. By 2011, nearly 200 tower cranes could be counted just along the half-hour drive from downtown Changsha to the city\u2019s high-speed rail station. Many commercial and residential towers built during the boom are still not full, although more are under construction.Prices have been steadily falling, down 7.4 percent since April. Well-located family apartments in new Changsha buildings sell for around 1 million renminbi, or about $160,000. Huang Yongjun, an administrator in his 30s with a wife and a 9-year-old daughter, said that he had just signed an agreement to buy a 1,140-square-foot apartment because he was fed up with renting and had noticed that Changsha prices still lagged those in the country\u2019s biggest metropolitan areas.\u201cI am buying now because I have a genuine need,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be the first apartment that I have owned.\u201dWages, too, are playing into the market. Rising wages help more blue-collar workers afford monthly mortgage costs, although they frequently struggle to muster down payments. But increasing labor costs hurt developers\u2019 profit margins and make it increasingly expensive to build more homes.Just a decade ago, China had a glut of young, eager workers. Construction sites commonly operated around the clock, with workers earning as little as $5 for a day\u2019s or night\u2019s work. But the government\u2019s \u201cone child\u201d policy, together with a quintupling in university enrollments in recent years, has produced a dearth of blue-collar workers.Zhang Ruling, a graying migrant worker who pushes wheelbarrows full of bricks at the construction site for the Xinyuan Splendid apartment complex in Changsha, said that he earned $46 for a nine-hour day shift. He turns down night shifts even though local employers offer an extra 29 percent in pay for working after dark.\u201cIt is not too tough to find work,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wants to do the night shift since it is more tiring.\u201dNathan Lai, a spokesman for the Xinyuan Real Estate Company, based in Beijing, which is building the project, said that labor costs had risen nearly tenfold over the past decade. For the 2,140-apartment Xinyuan Splendid project, the land cost $122 million; labor, previously a small expense, cost $45 million; and other costs, like steel girders, added up to $115 million more.While many homeowners, particularly recent buyers and speculators, worry about the fall in prices, others see opportunity. Cao Shi, a Changsha resident in his late 30s who has dabbled in operating small snack shops, said he and his wife paid $60,000 for a 970-square-foot apartment in 2009, and had seen the price for identical nearby apartments rise to $90,000 by last year.Now he estimates that the price of his family\u2019s apartment has dipped to $85,600. \u201cIf I had extra money, I would definitely buy a second apartment right now for investment purposes,\u201d Mr. Cao said. \u201cSome people are waiting for prices to drop further, but what if prices go back up? You would have lost the opportunity.\u201dHilda Wang, Jonah Kessel and Neil Gough contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mary Landrieu Is Defeated by Bill Cassidy in Louisiana Senate Runoff", "Date": "2014-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Mary L. Landrieu, the last Deep South Democrat in the United States Senate, was defeated in a runoff election here Saturday by Bill Cassidy, a Republican congressman who incessantly attacked the incumbent for her support of President Obama.With Mr. Cassidy\u2019s victory in what had been the last undecided Senate race of the midterm elections, the Republicans gained a total of nine Senate seats, giving them 54 senators and firm control of the upper chamber when the 114th Congress convenes in January.Speaking to supporters at the Crowne Plaza Hotel here, Mr. Cassidy said, \u201cThis victory happened because people in Louisiana voted for a government which serves us but does not tell us what to do. Thank y\u2019all.\u201d Even though Ms. Landrieu narrowly edged out Mr. Cassidy in a multicandidate primary in November, his victory was widely expected. A second conservative candidate with a significant following, Rob Maness, ran a strong third in the primary, and subsequently endorsed Mr. Cassidy.As in much of the South, Louisiana has seen many white Democrats defect to the Republican Party. Compounding Democrats\u2019 problems was Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which forced roughly 125,000 reliably Democratic voters to permanently relocate to other states.Mr. Cassidy, 57, is an associate professor of medicine at Louisiana State University who joined the House of Representatives in 2009. He closely followed the Republicans\u2019 overall strategy this year of nationalizing congressional races and linking Democrats to President Obama. Mr. Cassidy\u2019s campaign and the outside groups supporting it regularly noted that Ms. Landrieu had voted with Mr. Obama 97 percent of the time. Mr. Cassidy also repeatedly promised to seek the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which Ms. Landrieu voted for.Louisiana regularly ranks as one of the poorest and unhealthiest states in the country, but Mr. Cassidy\u2019s biography allowed him to pre-emptively combat suggestions that he was insensitive to the needs of the poor: According to his congressional website, he founded a community health care clinic, treated uninsured patients at the public Earl K. Long Hospital in Baton Rouge for two decades, and set up an emergency medical facility for Katrina evacuees in an abandoned Kmart shortly after the storm.\u201cMost in Congress who voted for Obamacare never read the bill,\u201d he said in the ad, adding: \u201cI read the bill. It was clear there would be canceled plans, expensive premiums, no guarantee you could keep your doctor. I voted no.\u201dFor Ms. Landrieu, 59, the daughter of former Mayor Moon Landrieu of New Orleans and the sister of the current mayor, Mitch Landrieu, the defeat brings an end to an 18-year run in the Senate in which she earned a reputation as a Democratic Party nonconformist, particularly with her staunch support of the oil and gas industry. Her prospects in the runoff dimmed after the Nov. 4 election, when Democrats lost their majority in the Senate. That meant that she would no longer chair the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which had given her significant sway over the oil and gas industry, which is crucial to Louisiana\u2019s economy.Senate Republicans also promised Mr. Cassidy a spot on the Energy Committee if he were to win, further undermining Ms. Landrieu\u2019s ability to claim that she was uniquely positioned to protect oil jobs in the state.In the final days of the campaign, Ms. Landrieu went on the attack as well, claiming that Mr. Cassidy received thousands of dollars in pay from Louisiana State for medical work that she said he did not do. Mr. Cassidy has denied any wrongdoing, and university officials said they were reviewing the matter.In her concession speech at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans, Ms. Landrieu spoke warmly about her father, who, as mayor, oversaw the racial integration of the city in the 1970s. She cast her work as a continuation of his legacy.\u201cWe may not have won tonight,\u201d she said, \u201cBut we most certainly have won some extraordinary victories.\u201dAs a congressman, Mr. Cassidy represented Louisiana\u2019s Sixth District, which covers most of his hometown, Baton Rouge. His record in Congress has been reliably conservative, earning him endorsements from the National Rifle Association, former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, and Phil Robertson, star of the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d reality TV series.Louisiana voters also decided two runoff races for the House of Representatives. The Fifth Congressional District seat, in northeast Louisiana, was won by Ralph Lee Abraham, a rural doctor and Republican candidate, according to The Associated Press. The current congressman, Republican Vance McAllister, lost his re-election bid in November after being captured on video kissing a campaign staff member who was not his wife.In the Sixth District, which Mr. Cassidy is vacating, Garret Graves, a Republican former coastal adviser to Gov. Bobby Jindal, defeated former Gov. Edwin Edwards, The A.P. projected. Mr. Edwards, an 87-year-old Democrat, was released from for prison in 2011 after serving time for extortion.Advertisement"}

The drama was not shot here: Critically examining state policies on screen is virtually impossible in the face of heavy censorship. Yet if the Dui Hua estimate is correct, the figure is more than in the rest of the world\u2019s combined. Amnesty International says the number of publicly disclosed executions worldwide in 2013 was 778. That excludes China, because no figure is made public here.To Mr. Hibbert, who specializes in political dramas, both the broad issue of capital punishment and China\u2019s particular social realities are disturbing.\u201cI do a lot of stories set internationally rather than genre stories set in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about China and thought I would quite like to look there.\u201d\u201cI was interested in doing something about corruption,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause it seems to me corruption destroys the will to live and saps hope.\u201d Communist Party leaders have said that corruption threatens their rule, and the president, Xi Jinping, has begun the deepest anti-corruption campaign in decades and has also recently announced a drive to improve justice.What Mr. Hibbert found on research trips was a country riddled with corruption, where miscarriages of justice are commonplace. Chinese news media regularly feature reports of people executed for crimes that are later attributed to someone else. \u201cThere must be a number of those,\u201d Mr. Hibbert said. \u201cAnd whether you think the death penalty is moral or not,\u201d when it\u2019s used \u201cwhere the legal system is corrupt, that needs highlighting.\u201d \u201cOne Child\u201d opens in London, where Mei, a British college student adopted from China, has received a message on social media from a stranger in Guangzhou, the capital of China\u2019s southern Guangdong province. A birth brother whom she didn\u2019t know existed is in trouble, facing execution for a crime he did not commit. As a foreigner and a blood relative, can she help?But Mei, played by Katie Leung (of the Harry Potter series) was raised by a nice, middle-class British-American couple in rural England. Her father (Donald Sumpter from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) writes about ancient Greek history, and her mother (Elizabeth Perkins from \u201cWeeds\u201d), translates Russian novels. Somewhat helplessly, Mei asks, \u201cWhat connections do I have?\u201d Directed by John Alexander, \u201cOne Child\u201d was filmed in London and Hong Kong with some secretly shot images spliced in from Guangzhou. The show\u2019s creators did not apply to shoot within China itself. \u201cWe were advised not to do that,\u201d Mr. Hibbert said. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t risk it.\u201d For Ms. Leung, whose character is faced with agonizing personal choices as she tries to save her brother, filming was rewarding, but also frightening.\u201cI was very scared before we started shooting,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cI think it was down to this very sensitive subject. Nobody wants to offend China at the moment, they are such a huge economy and have done great things. But the truth of the matter is that it\u2019s happening,\u201d she said, referring to the executions.For Mr. Hibbert, finding out the details how they happen was extremely difficult, but essential to the plot. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to get information about lethal injections,\u201d the method China largely uses, based on the American model, he said. With barely any information available in China, he explained: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like trying to investigate a crime. In order to get a confession, you need to get circumstantial evidence together and collect enough to make you feel you are telling an accurate story.\u201d \u201cWhat always strikes me is that support in China for the death penalty mirrors identical support in the U.S.,\u201d Dui Hua\u2019s chairman, John Kamm, said in a telephone interview. To dramatize the issue, Mr. Hibbert decided the story should be told by a Chinese central character. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the usual way we tell the story, an American hero finds something out in a foreign country,\u201d he said. That led to the figure of Mei, the \u201cone child\u201d of the title, given up by a mother who hoped for a son. Ms. Leung, a drama student at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, whose family emigrated there from Hong Kong, said she knew her ethnicity was important to the role, but that she hoped she isn\u2019t constrained by it forever. Yet \u201cto have the opportunity to play a role with that amount of hope and determination,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s very rewarding.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Falling Oil Prices Create a Central Banking Conundrum", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket TurmoilWhen is good economic news a reason to worry?When you\u2019re a central banker fighting a slump toward deflation, or broadly falling prices, in a time that oil prices are plummeting. And that is the situation that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, faced as he announced the results of the bank\u2019s latest policy meeting on Thursday. How he wrestles with that problem will help determine the outlook for Europe\u2019s flailing economy.The official line from many of the world\u2019s most influential makers of economic policy is that this is fantastic news for global growth, at least in places that don\u2019t count oil production as their dominant local industry.The fund estimates that a 30 percent decline in oil prices should improve growth by 0.8 of a percentage point in most advanced economies, Ms. Lagarde said. And prices are down more than that \u2014 about 35 percent since June 30.But the challenge Mr. Draghi and his fellow central bankers face is that they are trying \u2014 almost desperately \u2014 to attain higher inflation, closer to the 2 percent they target. And falling oil prices will drive inflation down further, particularly as the lower price of oil ripples through global supply chains and starts to affect more retail prices.In Central Banking 101, they teach you this about fluctuations in energy prices: It would be unwise to react to short-term moves that will have only a transitory effect on inflation. Oil prices go up and down \u2014 there\u2019s nothing you can do about it \u2014 but when they do, it doesn\u2019t tell you much about the longer-term path of inflation. Central bankers should keep looking over the horizon and focusing on the medium term.Following that guidance, central bankers would do pretty much whatever they were planning to do a few months ago, before the oil sell-off began. For the Fed, that would mean raising interest rates in mid-2015.But the Central Banking 101 lesson changes when a move in the price of oil and other commodities has some lasting effects on people\u2019s psychology. In the 1970s, for example, the oil price spikes caused by the Arab embargo combined with steadily increasing prices and wages to make people expect ever-increasing inflation, which became self-fulfilling as the decade progressed.In the 1970s, in other words, even if the Fed and other central banks shouldn\u2019t have reacted to the initial spike in oil prices, they should (in hindsight) have done more to fight the rising expectation of high inflation that it helped foster.We are in the exact opposite situation right now. Inflation is persistently low across the advanced world amid sluggish growth. And expectations are setting in more and more that this low-inflation world is here to stay, at least as measured by the bond market.At the same time oil prices have fallen, investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation have also been falling in most of the world\u2019s leading economies; in Germany, bond market prices suggest annual inflation will be only 0.26 percent over the next five years, down from 0.8 percent at the end of June.Markets are even pricing in lower American inflation in the five years after that \u2014 2019 through 2024 \u2014 than they were this past summer.So what\u2019s a central banker to do? A different tone is emanating from the three most important global central banks.His counterparts in Japan and Europe don\u2019t seem so sure. The Bank of Japan recently did a surprise expansion of its program to pump yen into the Japanese economy, in part because lower energy prices are causing falling inflation at a time the bank is trying to persuade consumers and businesses that inflation will rise.In his news conference Thursday, Mr. Draghi betrayed deep-seated worries that the falling oil prices would affect this inflationary psychology. While he concluded, like Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Fischer, that the impact of energy price declines was \u201cunambiguously positive,\u201d he continued by mentioning that the bank was monitoring an \u201ceffect that might happen if the lower prices get embedded in a lower wage formation process.\u201dIn other words, workers might demand smaller raises and employers might be less likely to grant raises amid the falling oil prices, which would create a self-fulfilling cycle leading to still lower inflation. Mr. Draghi said that the bank\u2019s governing council would evaluate this possibility as it weighs new actions to try to increase growth and inflation in Europe early next year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "3.6 Degrees of Uncertainty ", "Date": "2014-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy DegreesBut where did that target come from in the first place? And even if we manage to stay below it, will it really protect the planet from serious harm?That raised the question of how much warming would be dangerous. In the mid-1990s, the German government picked up on the 2C finding as a way to breathe life into the treaty.As the economic and scientific arguments accumulated, the Germans managed to persuade other countries to adopt the 2C target, turning it into official European policy. The proposal was always controversial, with African countries and island states, in particular, arguing that it was too much warming and would condemn them to ruin. The island states cited the potential for a large rise of the sea, and African countries feared severe effects on food production, among other problems.But as a practical matter, the 2C target seemed the most ambitious possible, since it would require virtually ending fossil fuel emissions within 30 to 40 years. At Cancun in 2010, climate delegates made 2C one of the organizing principles of negotiations.Yet even as the 2C target has become a touchstone for the climate talks, scientific theory and real-world observations have begun to raise serious questions about whether the target is stringent enough.For starters, the world has already warmed by almost one degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. That may sound modest, but as a global average, it is actually substantial. For any amount of global warming, the ocean, which covers 70 percent of the earth\u2019s surface and absorbs considerable heat, will pull down the average. But the warming over land tends to be much greater, and the warming in some polar regions greater still.That could ultimately mean 30 feet, or even more, of sea level rise, though scientists have no clear idea of how fast that could happen. They hope it would take thousands of years, but cannot rule out a faster rise that might overwhelm the ability of human society to adapt.Given the consequences already evident, can the 2C target really be viewed as safe? Frightened by what they are seeing, some countries, especially the low-lying island states, have been pressing that question with fresh urgency lately.Barring a technological miracle, or a mobilization of society on a scale unprecedented in peacetime, it is not at all clear how a lower target could be met. Some experts think a stricter target could even backfire. If 2C already seems hard to achieve, with the world on track for levels of warming far beyond that, setting a tighter limit might prompt political leaders to throw up their hands in frustration.In practice, moreover, a tighter temperature limit would not alter the advice that scientists have been giving to politicians for decades about cutting emissions. Their recommendation is simple and blunt: Get going now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin and Modi Reaffirm Bond Between Russia and India", "Date": "2014-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the most intriguing event of the day occurred across town in a private dining room at a luxury hotel, where Sergei Aksyonov \u2014 the barrel-chested prime minister of Crimea, the Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia \u2014 signed a memorandum of understanding with a group of Indian businessmen who call themselves the Indo-Crimean Partnership.The symbolic show of support put India in the middle of one of the most bitter disputes between Moscow and the West.Mr. Aksyonov organized a paramilitary force on the Crimean Peninsula early this year as pro-Western protests rose in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, and he was one of the first people to be singled out by the United States for sanctions. He traveled to India on a plane with Russian officials attending the meeting, and was flanked by Russian diplomats, whom he credited with arranging the event. Interfax, the Russian news agency, said it was Mr. Aksyonov\u2019s \u201cfirst international visit.\u201dBut both Indian and Russian officials said Mr. Aksyonov had not come as part of the official Russian delegation, and a spokesman for India\u2019s foreign minister said the Indian authorities had not been consulted about Mr. Aksyonov\u2019s appearance. Russia\u2019s embassy in New Delhi had invited reporters on Wednesday to the event with Mr. Aksyonov but said hours later that it had been canceled.\u201cBusiness is looking for the best place \u2014 a place that is calm, where you can protect your capital, where it is possible to increase your economic indicators,\u201d Mr. Aksyonov said. \u201cSo Crimea is a priority place.\u201dIn comments on Thursday, Mr. Modi lingered on the subject of historic loyalty, which has bound India and Russia. Decades after the Bangladesh war in 1971, officials still bring up the Soviet Union\u2019s support when the United States was allied with Pakistan.\u201cThe steadfast support of the people of Russia for India has been there even at difficult moments in our history, it has been a pillar of strength,\u201d Mr. Modi said. \u201cIndia, too, has always stood with Russia through its own challenges.\u201dThough some analysts see the Indian-Russian relationship as stagnant, during the visit Mr. Modi offered Mr. Putin plenty of reassurance. He publicly told Mr. Putin that \u201ceven if India\u2019s options have increased,\u201d Russia would remain India\u2019s top defense supplier, ensuring a predictable flow of income as Russia weathers falling oil prices and a weak economy. In response, Mr. Putin pledged to supply India with 20 nuclear reactors, and Russia\u2019s state oil company agreed to supply Essar, a private company, with a 10-year, fixed-price contract for oil that one official said was worth $5 billion.The agreements suggest that the relations between the two countries are more robust than many think, said Nandan Unnikrishnan, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.\u201cGiven Russia\u2019s isolation by the West and the slump in the economy, people thought it would fail to infuse any energy into the Indo-Russian deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is not what has happened.\u201dThe visit of Crimea\u2019s leader, however, remained the most surprising part of the day. Mr. Kripalani, the Mumbai businessman who invited Mr. Aksyonov to New Delhi, said that five Indian businessmen were full members of the Indo-Crimean Partnership and that 204 other firms had expressed interest.Mr. Kripalani runs a Mumbai business called the Pijikay Group of Companies, with what he said was an annual trade of $174 million in frozen shrimp. Crimea\u2019s trade isolation, he said, had created an opportunity.\u201cWe look at Crimea as an open door, welcoming Indian business,\u201d Mr. Kripalani said. \u201cI thought I would go and pick the low-hanging fruit.\u201dHe confessed to a touch of nervousness on Thursday, because, as he put it, \u201cour intentions might be misunderstood.\u201d He said he and his associates \u201care not involved in politics, we know nothing about politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Norwegians Turn Ambivalent on Statoil, Their Economic Bedrock", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the spring, Statoil cut 1,000 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force. In September, it postponed a much-criticized project in the Canadian tar sands for at least three years. On Oct. 29, reflecting collapsing oil prices and a steep tumble of its stock, it reported its first quarterly loss since 2001. And in November, it announced disappointing results from the year\u2019s program of drilling for new oil and gas in the Norwegian Arctic.The activism goes beyond conventional environmental concerns to issues of the company\u2019s pervasive presence in Norwegian life.At the University of Bergen and other schools, for instance, professors and students have protested Statoil\u2019s financing of academic research, worth about $12 million annually. And musicians and artists have campaigned against the company\u2019s widespread sponsorship of cultural events and organizations, which has included cash awards to performers whom Statoil calls \u201cHeroes of Tomorrow.\u201d\u201cBasically, you\u2019re a billboard for an oil company,\u201d Martin Hagfors, a musician, said in an interview in his studio in Oslo\u2019s lively Gronland district. \u201cAnd if you have any sense that we need to change direction, you can\u2019t be a billboard for an oil company.\u201dThe tensions are playing out in Parliament, too. In June, majority and opposition parties pressured Statoil to agree to provide electricity to several North Sea oil fields from land, using clean hydroelectricity delivered by cable rather than greenhouse-gas-emitting gas generators offshore.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing concern that Norway is basing its welfare to such a large extent on something that is increasing global warming,\u201d said Rasmus Hansson, who last year became the first member of the Green Party to be elected to Parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral issue.\u201dStatoil, which was concerned about costs and delays, fought back, and a compromise was eventually reached that will cut emissions by up to 23 million tons of carbon dioxide over the lifetime of the fields. The episode was seen as a milestone for Parliament, which normally rubber-stamps most Statoil projects.\u201cIt was a very important thing to do at the time we did it,\u201d said Terje Aasland, a member of Parliament with the Labor Party, the largest opposition party.\u201cClimate change is coming closer and closer every day,\u201d he added. \u201cI think people are more concerned about the future.\u201dSome Norwegians are even starting to discuss the idea of an eventual transition from oil and gas, an idea that would have been a nonstarter just a few years ago.How Norway wrestles with these and other issues may provide a preview of what is to come in other oil-rich countries, including the United States.Criticism of Statoil does not come easily, for the company has long been a source of affluence as well as national pride. Since it was founded in 1972 to exploit the extensive hydrocarbon deposits in the Norwegian continental shelf, Statoil, which is two-thirds owned by the government, has pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into federal coffers, including the wealth fund. Oil and gas exports have helped make Norway, which has a population of five million, one of the wealthiest nations in the world, with a median household income of more than $62,000.Even some of its fiercest critics acknowledge that Statoil has a special status among Norwegians.\u201cWe\u2019re very proud of Statoil,\u201d said Truls Gulowsen, head of the Norwegian chapter of Greenpeace, which is fighting the company\u2019s plans in the Arctic, Canada and elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s also ours. Therefore we should have a say in which projects and which strategic direction our company that we all love is going to take.\u201dAmong the world\u2019s oil giants, Statoil\u2019s environmental reputation is better than most. The company supports a carbon tax. It has been a leader in developing ways to store carbon dioxide underground to keep it out of the atmosphere. And its per-barrel emissions from producing oil in the North Sea are among the lowest anywhere.\u201cPeople tend to think we\u2019re very good at what we do,\u201d said Hege Marie Norheim, Statoil\u2019s senior vice president for sustainability.But as production has fallen in old North Sea fields, Statoil has looked elsewhere for oil and gas, including Canada \u2014 where production of tar sands oil has a much higher carbon footprint \u2014 and environmentally sensitive areas in the Arctic.That has environmentalists and others fuming. \u201cStatoil, the cleanest oil company, our Norwegian pride, why are you getting yourself involved in really dirty business?\u201d said Mr. Gulowsen of Greenpeace.Most of Statoil\u2019s oil and gas, including the 30 percent that comes from outside Norway, is burned in other countries. So while Norway itself is greener than many other countries \u2014 almost all of its electricity, for example, comes from hydropower \u2014 it is indirectly responsible for a disproportionate share of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions.If and when governments around the world put stricter limits on emissions, Statoil could be forced to leave some of its oil and gas in the ground. Market factors \u2014 a long period of depressed oil prices, for instance \u2014 could have the same result. Either way, the impact on Statoil, and on Norway\u2019s economy, could be severe.So it makes sense, critics say, for Statoil and other Norwegian companies to begin planning for an era of less or even no oil. Mr. Aasland, the Labor politician, argues that Statoil could use its offshore expertise to develop more wind power or other alternative energy sources.\u201cWe can use the knowledge and people in the oil industry,\u201d Mr. Aasland said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big opportunity over time to diverge from oil and gas to a more green economy.\u201dStatoil, not surprisingly, does not think it should be the one to leave any oil and gas behind.\u201cWe think that\u2019s not part of our contribution,\u201d Ms. Norheim said. \u201cOn the contrary, the oil that should be produced from now to the end should, to a very large extent, come from Norway, because it\u2019s good oil. It\u2019s safe and secure and delivered from us with low carbon emissions.\u201dAs for transforming the company into one with more of a focus on renewable energy, Ms. Norheim said that was unrealistic. \u201cWe are good at what we do, but we\u2019re not good at everything,\u201d she said.So for now, despite the depressed oil market and talk of more emissions limits, Statoil is still very much an oil and gas company.In November, in the middle of the more sobering news, Statoil announced that a new field, the Johan Sverdrup \u2014 one of the biggest North Sea discoveries in recent years and the crucial field in the electrification dispute with Parliament \u2014 could produce as much as $200 billion in revenue over the next 50 years.\u201cMake no mistake, the oil and gas sector is still pushing on,\u201d Mr. Hansson, of the Green Party, said. \u201cThe practical policy is to make Norway even more dependent on oil and gas.\u201dAnd no one is quite certain what Norway\u2019s future would look like if that were to change.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for people to see a society without the oil industry,\u201d said Ingrid Skjoldvaer, deputy chairwoman of the environmental group Nature and Youth. \u201cHow is that going to work? What are we going to live off then?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Feeling Uneasy About the Future", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsNew York has always been a pretty good barometer of the state of the world. Its fortunes rise and fall. It will never be as manicured like Paris, or as comfortable as London, or as beautiful as Rome, or as moneyed as Singapore. In good times it hums, in bad it\u2019s a jangling mess of police sirens. Over the past 40 years, I\u2019ve known the city\u2019s moods: dangerous and secure, anxious and confident, subdued and ebullient.These days, the mercury seems to be dipping. The streets are edgier, more aggressive. I recently saw a slim, well-dressed man take a covert look around before stooping to pick a cigarette butt off the sidewalk. There\u2019s a lot of scavenging in garbage. Desperation may be quiet, or just crazed. The other morning, for no apparent reason, somebody pushed a man off a subway platform to his death under a D train. That sort of thing makes New Yorkers eye each other in a different way. Fear has crept back.Perhaps it is not rational to view the world today with renewed anxiety. The happy half of humankind in Asia is still in the midst of a period of growth and optimism, whatever the looming perils of China\u2019s rise. Hundreds of millions of Asians have money in their pockets for the first time. They feel the 21st century is theirs to inherit from the West; they work longer hours to make sure that happens. Their focus is growth, whatever it takes, wherever the resources for it are to be found.Singapore\u2019s Orchard Road, mall central, is a gaudy monument to the aspirational and acquisitive drives of a new Asian middle class. Narendra Modi\u2019s India is on the march, broom in hand, with a mantra of self-made industriousness. The clean-up is physical (the paper-deluged offices of Indian bureaucrats are a Modi target) and moral (corruption). One slogan doing the rounds is \u201ctoilets, not temples.\u201d Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, is an equally vigorous leader. The landmark agreement on carbon emissions he signed with President Barack Obama could finally pave the way to a global climate accord by 2015.By historical standards, this is still an era of exceptional peace, as the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War I has reminded us. Medical breakthroughs are extending life; dying has become arduous. The empowering possibilities of technology link individuals in new ways. For many young people the squabbling of states and the posturing of politicians is little more than a sideshow to the borderless networks that count.Still, I trust my dipping New York barometer. People are angry and worried, with cause. Their pressured lives are not getting better. Fundamental injustices grow more acute. This clouds judgment because global affairs look like a scam put in place by the privileged. I have never felt more uneasy about the state of the world. The rule book has been torn up.Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, violating the Ukrainian borders Moscow had recognized in 1994, marked a turning point. How far President Vladimir Putin will go in his determination to prevent Ukraine from pursuing its aspirations for closer integration with the European economy and European law is unclear, but the war he has stirred up in the east of the country shows no sign of abating. The danger is real that the heavily armed forces deployed and orchestrated by the Kremlin will advance westward, perhaps even as far as Kiev. In that case, I do not expect an armed response from cowed Western powers, but I do expect near-panic in Baltic countries and parts of Eastern Europe. The credibility of NATO will become paper-thin.The response to Putin in Europe is no less worrying than these events themselves. The Russian leader basks in significant sympathy. The \u201cPutinversteher,\u201d or folk who understand Putin, as the Germans put it, are driven by a variety of motives, among them anti-Americanism, anger at the European Union, and identification with Putin\u2019s critique of Western values and societies as spineless and depraved. Beneath all this lurks something much simpler. Many people are restive. Europe is in the economic doldrums. Putin carries a banner called resistance. Everything is upside-down, which is how the spinners of fascist fables in Moscow (including the one that holds that Ukraine is a hotbed of anti-Semitic ideologues) want them to be. Truth is the first victim of war.The abrupt emergence of the jihadi movement calling itself Islamic State on a wide swath of territory straddling the Syrian-Iraqi border has been another sign of fragmenting order. The hopes of the Arab Spring have evaporated. It has proved impossible, outside Tunisia, to move beyond the sterile confrontation of quasi-military dictatorship and Islamist movements of various stripes; and equally impossible to forge a post-sectarian citizenship in societies riven by religious and ethnic differences.There is no consensus in the Arab world on the place of political Islam, which is to say on the central question of whether power and laws derive from the people or from God. This has proved an insurmountable hurdle. Syria sounded the death knell for the hopes of Arab youth, which centered on forging more representative and inclusive societies.The Syrian uprising against a dictator morphed into a jihadi-incubating vacuum. Outside powers did their manipulative worst. President Obama announced early in the conflict that the Syrian despot, Bashar al-Assad, should step down. He had no plan to achieve that objective. There is a price for inaction as well as action. That is not a fashionable thing to say in a time of post-Iraq and post-Afghanistan exhaustion. It is no less true for that.The killers of Islamic State are Internet-savvy and, like Putin, have been able to incarnate resistance to something; to what exactly is unclear, but broadly speaking the movement has channeled Sunni anger at America\u2019s tilting of the established Middle Eastern order in a Shiite direction, and has come to embody resistance to Western ideas in general, and the \u201cinfidel\u201d presence in the Middle East in particular. In England, France and Germany, among other European nations, the movement has been able to find recruits. This is another sign of ambient anger and frustration, often more acute among new immigrants. For the United States and the European nations that have battled ever since 9/11 to quash jihadi terrorist movements, the failure embodied in Islamic State\u2019s emergence is evident. Five beheadings of Western hostages have constituted a nightmarish humiliation.I do not think it is a coincidence that these developments have come at a time when the world\u2019s ordering power since 1945, the United States, is seen to be in retreat and the credibility of America has eroded. Obama did not help the American cause by committing in Syria to goals for which he lacked the means or by setting red lines he declined to uphold. These things get noticed in places like Moscow and Beijing. The world seems unstable, up for grabs, and susceptible to sparks. Putin and Xi and Modi are widely seen as more compelling leaders than Obama. They do not have the power Obama has, but they have an aura. The flux in global power has induced a dangerous moment.It is dangerous in part because the liberal democratic idea is under such pressure. That pressure comes in part from the authoritarian capitalist models in Russia and China. Capitalism, as Michael Ignatieff of Harvard University has noted, has proved to be politically promiscuous, with damaging consequences. But there are also strong internal pressures in Western democratic societies. These find their roots principally in growing inequality.The top 0.1 percent in the United States now holds about the same share of America\u2019s wealth as the bottom 90 percent, according to some estimates. The earnings of this bottom 90 percent, in inflation adjusted terms, fell between 2010 and 2013, while top incomes alone rose. Yet the taxation system favors the rich. As the Wall Street financier and New York Times op-ed writer Steven Rattner has pointed out, \u201cIncome taxes for the highest-earning Americans have fallen sharply, contributing meaningfully to the income inequality problem. In 1995, the 400 taxpayers with the biggest incomes paid an average of 30 percent in taxes; by 2009, the tax rate of those Americans had dropped to 20 percent.\u201dThis trend must be unsustainable. It is reflected today in the streets of New York, and it informs the dissatisfaction of the American middle class. There has never before been an economic recovery that passed the middle class by entirely; this one has. To confront the challenges they face, Western societies in general and America in particular must recover their vigor and fairness, through tax and educational reform above all. The yearning for liberal democracy is not dead, as recent events in Hong Kong have demonstrated, but democracies are under pressure. A violent tide could course across a disordered world if the United States does not once again demonstrate its extraordinary capacity for reinvention and renewal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Havana Celebrates Historic Shift, Economic and Political Hopes Rise ", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for Armando Guti\u00e9rrez, who operates a small inn in Havana, what it really comes down to is beds. He needs better ones, and the usual scramble to find them and other supplies often comes up empty.Now, Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez hopes the salvation of his business is at hand.\u201cIt will be step by step for sure, but we are super happy, all of us without words really to express this history,\u201d Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez said by phone \u2014 a phone he plans to replace with a better one if the United States makes good on its pledge to send more telecommunications equipment.For decades, the American embargo of Cuba has been the political sword and shield of the Castros, held responsible for stifling their nation\u2019s development, depriving their people of the most basic needs, and justifying their tight control over all aspects of society.Now their powerful rival is promising significant expansions in travel, exports and remittances to Cuba, the biggest erosion of the embargo since it was imposed more than 50 years ago.Experts say it will bring a flood of new money to the island, potentially injecting new life into the economy and, coupled with restored diplomatic ties, transforming relations between the two countries in ways not seen since a bearded rebel named Fidel came down from the Cuban mountains.17 Photos\u201cThis changes it all,\u201d Carlos Alzugaray, a former Cuban diplomat who is close to the Castros, said from the island.The question is whether the increased exchange will simply prop up Cuba\u2019s moribund economy and government, or breed truly democratic change on the island, something current American policy has not achieved.\u201cFor Cuba, this is an opportunity to speed up the processes of economic reform, political liberalization and openness,\u201d said Arturo Lopez-Levy, a former Cuban intelligence analyst now at New York University.Others were more skeptical, having seen previous thaws that did not produce dramatic change. They noted the 1996 American law known as Helms-Burton that prevents widespread commerce, and questioned Cuba\u2019s willingness to open up as well.\u201cThe regime will do everything in its power to have maximum control over foreign investment, forms of employment, high taxes, which have always been a great obstacle for economic and social development,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer, who coordinates dissident groups in Cuba. \u201cMost of these resources will still be used to maintain a repressive apparatus.\u201dFor many Cubans living through the incremental steps toward private enterprise that Mr. Castro set in motion, the changes announced by Washington and Havana are welcomed as much for their practical worth as for the historic sea change between governments.The Cuban economy is wobbly, and it may only worsen as its chief patron, Venezuela, slides further into economic and political difficulties. Cuba\u2019s economy grew only 1.4 percent this year, by the government\u2019s own generally rosy statistics, despite significant changes, including allowing the buying and selling of property and cars.Some trade and travel restrictions will be eased. Others depend on congressional action.More than 300,000 people have gone into business, and private farming has grown. The government recently said it would convert state-owned restaurants into private cooperatives, and it announced a plan last year to do away with a dual currency system that makes tourism and other goods expensive.The hope among Cubans is that the new easing of tension with the United States will accelerate the halting steps toward a market economy, while still maintaining the social ideals of free education and health care embedded in what Mr. Castro described on Wednesday as a \u201cprosperous and sustainable socialism.\u201dBut in order for the changes Mr. Obama envisions to work, Cuba will have to loosen up in significant ways. The island\u2019s vows to allow more private enterprise and foreign investment have been far more limited than many Cuban and international entrepreneurs have hoped for, with many saying it is almost impossible for them to participate.\u201cWe have incredible problems,\u201d said Nidialys Acosta, who set up a classic car services business with about 20 associates. \u201cWe have to jump through so many hoops.\u201dThe survival of her business depends on two American exports: spare parts for her cars and visitors to ride in them. From now on, she hopes that both will be easier to come by. \u201cI am jumping up and down for joy,\u201d said Ms. Acosta from her home in El Cerro, a Havana neighborhood. \u201cThis is my Christmas gift.\u201dBut while the Cuban government has called the expansion of private enterprise essential to reducing the inflated public sector that is burdening the economy, it does not recognize Ms. Acosta\u2019s business or many others. Getting parts like headlamps, mirrors and tires for a 1959 Chevrolet Impala and paying for them is extremely difficult and expensive because they cannot be ordered from the United States, but have to be brought in person by people traveling between Miami and Cuba, she said. Doing financial transactions in Cuba is difficult, she said, because her business does not officially exist.\u201cThe regulations make it almost impossible to thrive,\u201d she said, adding that the government needed \u201cto be more flexible.\u201d11 PhotosMr. Obama\u2019s potential willingness to remove Cuba from the State Department list of states that sponsor terrorism could have a big impact, according to Phil Peters, director of the Cuba Research Center in Alexandria, Va. He said the designation has severely complicated Cuba\u2019s ability to do business with international banks, and Mr. Obama said Wednesday that the designation would be reviewed.\u201cIt dramatically raises the cost of doing business\u201d for Cuba, Mr. Peters said. \u201cWhen Cuba does business internationally, they have to use banks and payment channels that have nothing to do with the United States.\u201dThe Cuban economy has a long list of ailments, including a shortage of cash, brain drain, anemic foreign investment and a scarcity of food production, with nearly 80 percent of its food imported, said Ted Henken, a professor of Latin American studies at Baruch College in New York.\u201cWithout the U.S. to blame,\u201d he said, \u201cthe shortcomings of the Cuban government will be much more transparent. The Cuban government will no longer be able to blame the United States for the obstacles that entrepreneurs face. The government will have to be able to explain why it\u2019s so hard to get a loan from a bank, get a cellphone, get access to broadband.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s going to be revealed for what it is,\u201d he added. \u201cThis thing is going to cause rising expectations both outside and inside of Cuba.\u201dMany Cuban entrepreneurs said they welcomed the change, regardless of the bumps ahead. Niuris Higueras Mart\u00ednez, founder and owner of popular Atelier, one of the private restaurants known as paladars, said \u201cthis news will bring what we need the most, market stability, affordable goods.\u201dThe ability of Americans to use credit cards and debit cards \u2014 a specific point Mr. Obama made on Wednesday \u2014 would be a big boost, she said, though it would require some adjustment in a country where cash is king.\u201cAll small-business owners like myself would need to learn a banking and credit culture that does not exist yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will evolve, little by little. I don\u2019t expect all of this to happen quickly, but we are definitely all ready to integrate ourselves in a new market economy.\u201dDamien Cave reported from Havana, and Randal C.

{"Headline": "Swiss Voters Reject Move to Restrict Immigrants", "Date": "2014-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLOGNE, Germany \u2014 Swiss voters on Sunday overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to drastically curb the influx of foreigners seeking to work and live in their country in the second major effort this year aimed at restricting immigration.Nearly three-quarters of voters rejected the proposal, initiated by an environmental group, to reduce Switzerland\u2019s annual immigration to 0.2 percent of the population, preliminary results released by the federal office for statistics showed.Voters also rejected a proposal to require the country\u2019s central bank, the Swiss National Bank, to hold 20 percent of its reserves in gold and a third referendum to end tax breaks for wealthy foreigners in Switzerland.All three proposals had been rejected by the country\u2019s influential business leaders, who are struggling to salvage Swiss relations with the European Union after voters in February narrowly supported a movement to reintroduce restrictions on the number of foreigners who are allowed to live and work in the country.That decision has thrown into question Switzerland\u2019s participation in the freedom-of-movement treaties it had signed with the bloc, prompting a swift response from Brussels, which halted an exchange program for university students and suspended talks on linking Swiss utilities to the European Union energy market.If successful, the proposal on Sunday would have further damaged relations and future prospects for the Swiss economy, Economiesuisse, a lobby group for business interests in Switzerland, said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cThe radical bill would have massively harmed the Swiss economy in the future,\u201d the statement said. \u201cA majority of the Swiss people wants controls on immigration, but disapprove of strict quotas in the Constitution that do not take into account the needs of the economy.\u201d Nearly one-quarter of the roughly eight million inhabitants of Switzerland are foreigners, many of them job seekers from European Union countries, although it is not one of the bloc\u2019s 28 members. The growth in job seekers has spurred a backlash among many Swiss who fear that their country\u2019s generous welfare system and delicate ecosystem cannot withstand a continued influx of outsiders.Nevertheless, the political will among Swiss voters to uphold the strict quota proposed by the Ecopop environmental group, which would have limited annual immigration to about 16,000 people, appeared to have been dulled by the repercussions of the past nine months.Ecopop blamed the \u201coverwhelming oppositional propaganda\u201d aimed against their proposal for its defeat on Sunday. \u201cWe regret that the supporters of overwhelming growth won this referendum,\u201d the group said in a statement released hours after the first returns indicated that it would not garner sufficient support for the initiative, \u201cStop Overpopulation, Save Natural Resources.\u201dObservers noted that the initiative had also failed to win strong support from the rightist Swiss People\u2019s Party, which introduced the referendum in February, arguing that it was necessary if Switzerland was to retain its identity in the face of immigration.\u201cThe message is clear,\u201d Claude Longchamp, a political scientist told Swiss public television channel SRF. \u201cThe negative consequences of the Ecopop initiative are massive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": " Backsliding in Afghanistan", "Date": "2014-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialFirst, Mr. Obama authorized a more expansive mission for the American military in 2015 than originally planned. His order would put American troops right back into ground combat by allowing them to carry out missions against the Taliban and other militants. He had previously said that the residual force would be engaged only in counterterrorism operations aimed at remnants of Al Qaeda. The new order also permits American jets and drones to support Afghan military missions.Already, the number of American troops to remain in Afghanistan after December has been increased by 1,000, up to 10,800. NATO allies are supposed to provide 4,000 troops next year, bringing the total of foreign forces to 12,000 to 14,000. Secretary of State John Kerry has said that any additional American troops above 9,800 are temporary and are merely covering for NATO allies that are still trying to decide how many forces to contribute.But if NATO fails to contribute sufficient troops, then what?Mr. Obama seems to be having second thoughts about his Afghan strategy after the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the sudden collapse of the Iraqi army. He may be trying to avoid blame if something similar happens in Afghanistan, where Taliban attacks are on the rise.That is not to say that Mr. Ghani, a former World Bank executive, should not be supported. He shows more promise, energy and purpose in dealing honestly with his country\u2019s staggering challenges \u2014 including the insurgency and a weak, corrupt economy \u2014 than Mr. Karzai did.Still, Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah have struggled to make other important decisions, including the appointment of a cabinet, which they promised would be done before the conference and now say will take several weeks more. Given Afghanistan\u2019s perilous security situation, the country\u2019s leaders and political factions might be expected to put aside their differences, but that hasn\u2019t happened yet.One lesson learned over the last 13 years is this: No amount of foreign assistance \u2014 not tens of thousands of troops, billions of dollars or unlimited amounts of military equipment \u2014 will make any real difference if the Afghans cannot or will not pull together a functioning, relatively uncorrupt and competent government, and take primary responsibility for themselves and their country.Administration officials are still insisting \u201cthe combat mission ends\u201d by the end of this year, but that\u2019s simply not credible. Mr. Obama should stick to his original plan to have the remaining troops focus on training and advising the Afghan army and going after Al Qaeda. Realistically, that seems the most the American-led military coalition can achieve.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Commuters Can Spread Out ", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving InScotch Plains, now home to about 23,500 residents, saw a big population increase in the early 1900s with a wave of immigrants from Italy. The Italian influence is still evident, as seen in a monument to Christopher Columbus outside the township\u2019s municipal building.For Tami Eagle Bowling and her husband, David Bowling, who were longtime city dwellers, moving to suburban New Jersey with their two young children has been something of an adjustment. Mr. Bowling has had to get used to a daily commute of more than 90 minutes each way to his job on the Upper East Side. Ms. Bowling has had to deal with a parade of service and repair workers to their home, something the couple did not have in their two-bedroom Manhattan apartment, where the super took care of everything.\u201cMy husband said he wanted our own little oasis, and that\u2019s what this property feels like,\u201d she said of the four-bedroom contemporary house, complete with a \u201cman cave,\u201d on an acre, for which they paid $1.15 million this fall. \u201cThe view from my new kitchen is like a forest. We\u2019re seeing deer in our backyard every day, which is breathtakingly beautiful.\u201dAnother newcomer, Tamara Lover, has also been seeing deer in the backyard of the Scotch Plains home she and her husband, Oliver Boreham, moved to in November. With a year-old daughter and another child on the way, the couple found the Hoboken apartment where they had lived for four years growing a bit tight.So this summer, they drew a circle around Manhattan of places within an hour\u2019s commute. Their search took them to Scotch Plains and a 60-year-old four-bedroom Cape, on an acre with an in-ground pool, which they ended up buying in September for just under the asking price of $579,000.With much of the original d\u00e9cor intact, the house included a basement finished in the style of a Western saloon, with swinging doors, a wooden bar and a double sink labeled \u201cwater trough,\u201d features that Ms. Lover said her husband has embraced.\u201cHe\u2019s purchased a Stetson hat and a dart board,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a pair of Western boots from Amazon is sitting on the doorstep right now.\u201dAnother couple who made the recent leap from city to suburbs in similar fashion were Danielle and Todd Sherman, newlyweds who faced a September deadline to renew the lease on their Manhattan apartment. While acknowledging that working and living in the city \u201cwas a blast,\u201d Ms. Sherman said she and her husband were \u201cready for a different chapter.\u201dLike Ms. Lover and Mr. Boreham, they drew a commuter radius around Manhattan and found themselves in this Union County township, buying a 1996 five-bedroom colonial on an acre for $835,000. They closed in July and moved in at the end of August. Like Ms. Bowling, Ms. Sherman has been impressed by the natural beauty and serenity of her new home.\u201cThere\u2019s an air of peacefulness that I didn\u2019t even realize I was missing until I moved here,\u201d she said. \u201cLife seems a lot more calm.\u201dWhat You\u2019ll FindAt around nine square miles, Scotch Plains appeals to growing families with its one-acre zoning on the south side of town, which was largely farmland until the 1950s. Properties in the neighborhoods north of the train tracks also tend to be larger than what one might find in neighboring Westfield or Fanwood.The housing, mostly built in the last 50 to 60 years, consists of split-levels, ranches and newer colonials. Newer developments include Stirling Chase and Berwyck Chase, two large neighborhoods of single-family homes built in the 1990s, and the Reserve, a 100-unit townhouse development that opened in 2004.The town\u2019s larger lots, and an improving economy, have ushered in a recent wave of expansions or tear-downs and rebuilding. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of modifying going on,\u201d said Anne Weber, an agent with Coldwell Banker, who has lived in Scotch Plains for 25 years. \u201cYou have splits becoming colonials or being knocked down entirely and replaced with custom homes.\u201dSheldon Furman, an agent with Re/Max Home Connection, said many of his clients choose Scotch Plains after finding that they can get more house and property for their money there. After moving in, they discover the town\u2019s neighborliness.\u201cIt\u2019s a down-to-earth, family-oriented town,\u201d Mr. Furman said.What You\u2019ll PayAs of Dec. 11, there were 101 homes on the market in Scotch Plains, ranging from a 1996 age-restricted two-bedroom condominium listed at $180,000 to a six-bedroom six-bath house built in 2005 on 1.8 acres listed at $2.5 million. Pricing and sales activity has remained steady in the last couple of years: Through the first week of December, 239 homes had sold at an average selling price of $486,000, according to Ms. Weber, while in 2013, 242 homes sold for an average price of $488,000. Two condos at the Reserve are on the market, one with three bedrooms and one with two, both listed at $399,000.What to DoThe SchoolsThe CommuteScotch Plains is about 26 miles southwest of Lower Manhattan, a trip of about 50 minutes by car, traffic permitting, via Interstate 78 and the Holland Tunnel. New Jersey Transit trains run from the neighboring borough of Fanwood to Newark, connecting to Penn Station or to Lower Manhattan via PATH. In March, the Raritan Valley Line added some weekday off-peak trains that connect Fanwood directly with Manhattan. Direct trains take about 55 minutes; those with a change in Newark, about an hour. A one-way ticket is $9.25. Route 113 NJ Transit buses run from Scotch Plains to Port Authority, taking around 55 minutes; the fare is $9 one way.The HistoryAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Companies Clamor to Do Business in New Cuban Market", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPepsiCo wants in. So do Caterpillar and Marriott International.Within hours of President Obama\u2019s historic move to restore full diplomatic relations with Cuba, companies in the United States were already developing strategies to introduce their products and services to a market they have not been in for the better part of 50 years \u2014 if ever.\u201cCuba is a potential market for John Deere products and services,\u201d Ken Golden, a spokesman for Deere & Company, a leading maker of farm and construction equipment based in Illinois, said by email. Many American companies are eager to enter Cuba, but they will face big obstacles to succeeding in the market.But while there may be robust opportunities for some companies, especially those selling products or goods that could be viewed as enhancing Cuba\u2019s own domestic production or helping to develop its underused resources, other companies could get the cold shoulder.\u201cFor a company like McDonald\u2019s, the Cuban government is going to ask, \u2018How does McDonald\u2019s coming in and selling hamburgers help the economy of Cuba?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Kirby Jones, founder of Alamar Associates, which has advised companies on doing business in Cuba since 1974. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to be like other regions where you see a McDonald\u2019s on every corner.\u201dDespite Cuba\u2019s long stagnation and isolation from the global economy, the potential trade opportunities go both ways. While some Americans will be itching at the opportunity to obtain the famed Cuban cigars more easily, the country also has a surprisingly robust biotechnology industry that makes a number of vaccines not now available in the United States. Another hot spot for the economy could be mining, as Cuba has one of the largest deposits of nickel in the world.While United States companies are eager to establish a toehold in the country, many expect former Cuban businessmen and leaders in the rum or sugar industries to lead the charge.\u201cThe Cuban people have immense pride in their history, and those from the expatriated community and those who have continued to live in Cuba will seek to return to the international stage the best way that they can,\u201d said Richard Harris, a vice president of operations and product development for the luxury travel company Abercrombie & Kent, which has arranged trips to the Caribbean nation. \u201cBacardi disassociated itself from Cuba, but I\u2019m sure somebody must be thinking, \u2018How can we re-establish the brand with its heritage?\u2019\u00a0\u201dPresident Obama\u2019s move to open relations between Washington and Havana for the first time in 54 years was widely seen as the signal for trade to resume, but, in fact, the United States is already the fourth-largest exporter to Cuba, behind China, Spain and Brazil.The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allowed the sale of unprocessed agricultural products and raw forestry materials by American producers to Cuba, though with strict restrictions. Producers needed to be paid in cash in advance, and payments needed to be funneled through a third-party bank in another country, typically one in Europe.Last year, the United States exported $359 million worth of goods to Cuba, compared with a high of $711 million in 2008, according to American government statistics.American companies often struggle to compete. Tyson Foods and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride have done a brisk business selling frozen chicken, but sales of grain by Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland have fallen off sharply in recent years because suppliers in other countries, like Brazil, offered cheaper products or allowed their goods to be bought on credit.\u201cThis is a wonderful first step, but we would like to see the embargo ended,\u201d said Devry Boughner Vorwerk, a vice president of corporate affairs for Cargill. Congress would need to act to lift the embargo entirely. Under the changes in banking and trade, American companies like Home Depot, Caterpillar and Deere can expect to be welcomed with open arms by the Cuban government, as they would be viewed as providing items or goods or services that support Cuba\u2019s domestic sector. A much bigger question mark hangs over companies geared toward selling consumer goods \u2014 whether Frito-Lay corn chips or Apple iPads \u2014 to Cubans, most of whom have very limited disposable income. Analysts and advisers say it will be nearly impossible for American companies with franchise-based models, including many of the world\u2019s largest chain restaurants like McDonald\u2019s, Subway or Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, to establish beachheads.Some trade and travel restrictions will be eased. Others depend on congressional action.Instead, the bigger opportunity for many consumer-focused companies may come from selling to the increasing number of Americans expected to visit Cuba if travel restrictions are fully lifted. If that happens, the annual number of visitors could jump to four million from three million practically overnight, analysts say. American visitors will presumably seek creature comforts in well-known brands like Coke, Pepsi and Bud Light.American hospitality and hotel companies, shut out for decades, are quickly assessing the opportunities in Cuba as well, but analysts caution that they, too, will face some high barriers.While the Cuban government may welcome a high-end brand looking to establish a luxury resort \u2014 something to attract big spenders \u2014 it will probably follow its current path of offering only management contracts to many other hoteliers. The government in Havana prefers to own the buildings and land itself. That is the arrangement the Spanish chain Meli\u00e1 Hotels International made for its Havana properties, two consultants said.Still, American hotel executives indicated that they were undaunted. \u201cWe will take our cues from the U.S. government but look forward to opening hotels in Cuba, as companies from other countries have done already,\u201d Arne M. Sorenson, president and chief executive of Marriott International, said by email.Those longing for a return to the days of rum-filled nights of gambling in luxurious surroundings may have to wait awhile, though. Even in the best of circumstances, a luxury resort can take up to a decade to plan and build. Cuba badly needs to update its aged infrastructure and train people to provide high-end services to big spenders, consultants say. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going to get is a midmarket two- or three-star experience from a remodeled hotel in Havana that will be cool for somebody from New York or Charlotte who wants to experience and think back to the Hemingway days,\u201d said Rick Newton, founding partner at Resort Capital Partners, a real-estate investment advisory firm that focuses on small high-end properties in the Caribbean.\u201cBut for a true five-star experience that will attract five-star customers who want five-star amenities, and served by a five-star staff,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re at least a decade out.\u201d Advertisement"}

After day broke, most establishments in the island capital remained closed despite regular broadcasts on state-run radio urging businesses to open.\u201cIt seems a coup attempt occurred last night,\u201d Dan Whitman, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Banjul, wrote in an email. \u201cThere has been no sign of transfer of political or military power.\u201dGambia\u2019s president, Yahya Jammeh, was traveling outside the country when the attempt occurred. An official in Chad told Reuters that Mr. Jammeh\u2019s plane had landed in N\u2019Djamena, that country\u2019s capital, and that he planned to return to Gambia.Reports over the weekend had quoted state radio as saying that Mr. Jammeh was on a visit to France, but French officials were quoted as saying that there was no record of his arrival there.

The Roaring Twenties? Hardly. The late-20th-century free-love movement? Not even close. The Victorian era is, unquestionably, the sexiest. What\u2019s hotter than anxiety and repression? Or more titillating than the chasm between public and private behavior, between the pedestal-placing of the wife/mother and the enormous rise in prostitution? It\u2019s no coincidence that one of the most erotic characters in literature, Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, appeared in 1897, toward the end of Queen Victoria\u2019s reign. (Remember: He had to leave Transylvania and come to England to feast upon pure blood, and open all those untouched . . . necks.) Even the thought of the armorlike clothing of the times coupled with the frilly nothings underneath makes me swoon. There\u2019s a reason the most ubiquitous lingerie shop in America is called Victoria\u2019s Secret and not, say, Richard Nixon\u2019s Secret.Living as we do in a culture so vulgar and permissive that a reality series entitled \u201cDating Naked\u201d engenders a collective yawn, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising we glamorize the Victorians as the epitome of both passion and restraint. (Ooh, restraint.) Yet this romantic perception is almost nowhere to be found in Ruth Goodman\u2019s informative and quite startling \u201cHow to Be a Victorian.\u201dGoodman calls herself a \u201cdomestic historian,\u201d and has participated in the kinds of British re-enactment-of-history series that have made her a celebrity. On shows with names like \u201cVictorian Pharmacy\u201d and \u201cTudor Monastery Farm,\u201d she has spent months working, dressing, eating, bathing \u2014 and more important, not bathing \u2014 like her 19th-century ancestors. She is, she says, interested not in the kings and princes and politicians, \u201cwho honestly bore me a little,\u201d but in the ordinary Victorian \u2014 \u201cyou and me.\u201d This book is over 400 pages of you and me. If you want to understand how Victorians thought, you read Walter E. Houghton\u2019s classic \u201cThe Victorian Frame of Mind, 1830-1870.\u201d But if you want to know how they looked, sounded, felt and smelled, there is no better guide than this one. Goodman likes to get down in the muck \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of it in 19th-century Britain.What\u2019s most striking is the amount of effort it took just to stay warm, clean and fed. If Charles Dickens\u2019s hearth scenes were indescribably delicious, that may be because he and his fellow Victorians spent so much time being so damn cold \u2014 the poor out of economy, the wealthy out of the belief that without a constant stream of cold fresh air the body is essentially poisoned. (It\u2019s a cultural notion that\u2019s still a little hard to shake. My 80-year-old husband is from Northumberland, and as a consequence I might as well live in a meat locker.) Here are the things you don\u2019t think about when you\u2019re watching something like \u201cThe Forsyte Saga.\u201d The choking air pollution from all the coal fires. The atrophy of a woman\u2019s stomach and chest muscles from years of relying on a corset for shape and posture. The fact that a country that saw its population almost triple within a few decades had no real sewage system, which meant that by 1858, the Thames was overflowing with human waste. And then, of course, the potato blight meant that huge numbers of English citizens were also starving. Goodman notes that the poor were markedly shorter than the wealthy, and several inches shorter than the average Londoner today. \u201cIt takes a lot of hunger to do that to people,\u201d she adds. But even when money wasn\u2019t an issue, self-abnegation was. In many homes children were sent to bed without dinner not as a punishment, but because \u201cthe self-control and self-denial induced by hunger were thought to teach enduring habits of self-sacrifice and to aid in fashioning a more moral individual,\u201d Goodman writes. (Our era is clearly not the first to connect slimness and moral superiority.)There is enough detail here on the social significance of everything from bread to laundering to hair fixatives to satisfy the most ardent history-obsessive. As a hypochondriac, I was particularly drawn to the sections on Victorian medicine. Before antibiotics, and with the new crowding and population explosion brought on by the Industrial Revolution, cholera, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tuberculosis and typhoid were looming threats. And with no regulation of the advertising industry, manufacturers could claim pretty much anything. Which is how the ingredients in Tuberculozyne, which purported to cure tuberculosis, could be potassium bromide, glycerin, almond flavoring, water and caramel coloring. But drugs that did nothing might have been preferable to the \u201ctonics\u201d that did work, which often contained laudanum or mercury. It was speculated that as much as a third of the infant mortality rate in Manchester had to do not with disease but with drugging children. Popular tonics like Mrs. Winslow\u2019s Soothing Syrup and Street\u2019s Infant Quietness did indeed stop children from being pesky, as they were filled with opiates. Unfortunately they also stopped children from wanting to eat, and many an infant \u201cslipped quietly away.\u201d Oddly, the details of Victorian life we\u2019re most familiar with, or think we\u2019re familiar with \u2014 the attitudes about sex and women as chattel to their husbands \u2014 are treated almost as afterthoughts. Maybe that\u2019s because Goodman felt these subjects were well-covered territory already. Nevertheless, I did learn that women were supposed to enjoy sex \u2014 in the context of marriage, of course \u2014 and masturbation was considered a far more dangerous activity for men than women. Of course, that may be because so very, very few women indulged, as we all know. . . .Goodman\u2019s unique selling proposition as a historian is that she walks the walk of her time period, even when that walk involves hard labor in a corset and a hoop skirt. The book is peppered with her wonderful, and often wonderfully dotty, social experiments. For months on end she brushed her teeth with soot, wore the era\u2019s recyclable sanitary towels (\u201can unusual idea to adjust to,\u201d she says, in a moment of supreme understatement), set fire to herself cooking on a Victorian range and cleaned herself only with a linen towel, thus replicating the Victorian aversion to water, which was thought to possibly open the pores to infection. (PS, Goodman insists the dry-rubbing method works just fine.)But even Goodman has her limits. She tried to make condoms in the Victorian style, \u201cbut the handwork required is remarkably precise and complex. The sheep\u2019s gut has to be thoroughly cleaned, soaked in an alkali solution and stripped of all its adjoining tissue to leave only the gut wall.\u201d One of the great pleasures of \u201cHow to Be a Victorian\u201d? There\u2019s a shudder on almost every page.I had my own Ruth Goodman moment recently. After a trip to see his family in Britain, my venerable husband brought back some vintage cotton nightgowns from the 1880s for me. The cotton was superb, crisp, blindingly white and thick, like nothing we have today. They also stretched from my chin to my ankle. He wanted me to model them. I realized that somehow, to him, these were better than anything Victoria\u2019s Secret had to offer. I tried to get in the spirit. But after I read Goodman, the romance and naughtiness dimmed, and the harshness of the Victorian life shone bright. I could think of this garment only for its warmth, and perhaps for a certain Miss Havisham-\u00adishness. I do plan to model the nightgowns \u2014 in my coffin.

Gross; and \u201cinitiate a new phase in relations.\u201dThe Vatican\u2019s most senior official after the pope, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the secretary of state, moderated the October meeting after the two countries sought out the Vatican as a trusted broker near the conclusion of their negotiations.But Francis has quickly become one of the world\u2019s leading figures, and his role in the United States-Cuba breakthrough undoubtedly is tied to his status as the first Latin American pope of the Roman Catholic Church.\u201cHe knows the Cuban situation by heart,\u201d said Gianni La Bella, a professor of contemporary history and an expert in Latin American Catholicism, as well as a member of the Community of Sant\u2019Egidio, a liberal Catholic group active in international affairs. \u201cHe visited when he was a cardinal and has a strong relationship with the archbishop of Havana, who is obviously a strategic player in this.\u201dIn April, the Vatican and Cuba celebrated 79 years of diplomatic relations as they jointly staged a photography exhibition at a church in Rome. Although the Vatican has had problems with Havana, it steadfastly opposes the American embargo and has kept diplomatic lines open.Fidel Castro visited the Vatican in 1996 and met with Pope John Paul II. Two years later, John Paul visited Cuba, where he criticized the embargo as causing hardship for ordinary people and called for it to be rescinded. His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, also visited Cuba, in 2012.\u201cI was in Cuba for almost two years, and I understand what this news means to the island,\u201d said Msgr. Angelo Becciu, once the Vatican\u2019s ambassador to Cuba. \u201cIt opens new scenarios and gives great hope to all Cuban people. The cease of the embargo will encourage and revitalize the island\u2019s perspectives, as well as its economy.\u201dAfter he became pope in 2013, Francis was expected to revitalize the church in the Southern Hemisphere. But his background has also helped the Vatican reposition itself as an independent actor in diplomacy, less tethered to European or American worldviews than in the past.Francis\u2019s appointment of Cardinal Parolin as secretary of state was also significant. Long considered one of the Vatican\u2019s most talented diplomats, Cardinal Parolin served as apostolic nuncio in Venezuela, one of Cuba\u2019s closest allies. From that perch, Cardinal Parolin gained a sophisticated understanding of regional dynamics and the Cuban predicament, Professor La Bella said.\u201cThe Vatican\u2019s knowledge of the Latin American situation is at a very high level, and very direct,\u201d he said.Monsignor Becciu, currently a member of the State Secretariat in the Vatican, added that Wednesday\u2019s announcement, on Francis\u2019s birthday, was certainly a \u201cbeautiful present for the Holy Father.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It Should Be So Lucky", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTourist HavenThat\u2019s because Cancun isn\u2019t a symbol of free market capitalism, and American tourists didn\u2019t make the place what it is today. An arm of the Mexican central bank did, in perhaps the largest and most successful example of central economic planning in North American history. Cuba should be so lucky as to have made its planned economy work as well as Cancun\u2019s.\u201cWe knew exactly what we wanted to build \u2014 a resort that would attract a massive flow of tourists from the United States,\u201d Enriquez said. \u201cBut before we could obtain the go-ahead, we had to convince the government that tourism was the fastest-growing, most dynamic sector of economic growth in the world.\u201cAs bankers, we approached this from a banker\u2019s point of view, taking everything measurable into account, feeding it into a computer and leaving nothing to chance.\u201d ...Infratur had the bank\u2019s computers so tied up with tourism statistics that the Enriquez team finally had to link up on a full-time lease basis with one across the border in California. But even so, with all the statistics flowing into the machines, the nitty-gritty work remained to be done.What the planners did next was to peel off their pinstriped bankers\u2019 suits, turn off the computers and head into the boondocks to check out those areas in Mexico which, according to the printouts, had all the necessary ingredients. The thing to do now was to personally check the swimming, the beaches, the actual living conditions at various places along Mexico\u2019s 6,000 miles of coastline and compare each site with the data that the computers had produced ...Enriquez said, \u201cWe finally narrowed the choice down to 25 sites and then gave preference to those areas where people were extremely poor \u2014 as long as all the other attributes were present, a labor supply, for example. The Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Cancun Island proved to be ideal in this regard. There is great poverty and no industry \u2014 since sisal has been replaced by plastics \u2014 and yet the area has all the ingredients to attract tourism: sun, sea, and good weather the year round, plus easy access to some of the world\u2019s greatest archaeological treasures, the Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza and Tulum, for example.\u201dAfter Infratur made its choice, the Mexican government bought all the land on Cancun Island. It built an airport and a golf course with help from a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank. It built government-owned hotels and financed private ones at preferential interest rates, years before the resort was established enough to attract unsubsidized capital. It constructed a brand-new city to house workers.The Cancun development was a success, attracting millions of visitors each year and generating enough economic activity to support a city of 600,000. Cancun\u2019s 32,000 hotel rooms are now privately owned. But the economic initiative and investment capital behind the resort initially came from the public sector. If you want to visit a planned economy on vacation, you don\u2019t need access to Cuba; you can just fly to Cancun.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Signals Support for New U.S. Sanctions to Pressure Russian Economy ", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With Russia already staggering under the weight of one of its worst financial crises in years, the United States signaled on Tuesday that it would further increase the economic pressure with a new raft of sanctions targeting the Russian defense, energy and banking industries.President Obama said through a spokesman that he would sign newly passed legislation expanding measures intended to cordon off large Russian state firms from Western financing and technology while also providing $350 million in arms and military equipment to Ukraine as it battles a pro-Russian insurgency in its eastern regions.The legislation had concerned the president, who has tried not to get too far out in front of European allies on sanctions and resisted sending lethal aid to Ukraine. But Congress passed the bipartisan measure without opposition, making a veto politically untenable, and administration officials said they were satisfied that enough discretion was incorporated into the bill to give the president room to maneuver.\u201cThe president does intend to sign the piece of legislation that was passed by Congress,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cBut we do have some concerns about that legislation because while it preserves flexibility, it does send a confusing message to our allies because it includes some sanctions language that does not reflect the consultations that are ongoing.\u201dThe new sanctions come as Russia\u2019s economy is reeling from the collapse of the ruble, the increasing flight of capital investment and the specter of recession. Past rounds of sanctions imposed by Mr. Obama and the European Union in response to Russia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine have contributed to a broader economic and political instability that has been exacerbated recently by the plunge in the price of oil, on which Russia is deeply dependent.Mr. Earnest said the turmoil was the result of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s own actions. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the failure of Vladimir Putin\u2019s strategy to try to buck up his country,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cRight now, he and his country are isolated from the broader international community.\u201dRussian officials have lashed out in recent days at the prospect of new sanctions. \u201cRussia will not only survive but will come out much stronger,\u201d Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister, told France 24, the television network. \u201cWe have been in much worse situations in our history, and every time we have got out of our fix much stronger.\u201dHe said there were \u201cvery serious reasons to believe\u201d that the United States was pursuing a strategy of regime change, designed to topple Mr. Putin\u2019s government, and he disparaged American lawmakers. \u201cIf you look at U.S. Congress, 80 percent of them have never left the U.S.A., so I\u2019m not surprised about Russophobia in Congress,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said.Even without Congress, Mr. Obama has already authorized several rounds of sanctions that have largely cut off major Russian banks from American credit markets, blocked the transfer of technology for long-term energy exploration, and frozen the assets of a number of Mr. Putin\u2019s allies and barred them from traveling to the United States. Mr. Obama has been careful to coordinate the measures with European allies, who have been reluctant to escalate the confrontation with Russia because of closer economic ties.The administration reached out to European officials in recent days to assure them that Mr. Obama would implement the new legislation as part of their joint efforts to keep Mr. Putin from driving a wedge among the Western nations. European officials are talking about imposing new sanctions in the coming days specifically related to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, but they almost certainly would not go as far as the new American legislation contemplates.Some analysts said Mr. Obama had little choice but to sign the legislation since Russia has continued to violate the terms of a cease-fire negotiated months ago in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.\u201cGiven Russian military resupply of the separatists in Ukraine during the last month, the U.S. had to raise the economic costs to Putin for his outright aggression,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a former diplomat and undersecretary of state under President George W. Bush. \u201cCombined with the collapse of the ruble, sanctions will hit Putin\u2019s government where it is most vulnerable \u2014 its very shaky economy.\u201dBut it is not clear how much of the authority granted under the legislation Mr. Obama will invoke. The bill requires the president to impose at least three sanctions from a menu of nine options on Rosoboronexport, the main Russian state arms exporter, and other military companies accused of fostering instability in Ukraine, as well as in Moldova, Georgia and Syria. But it includes a provision allowing him to waive the requirement if he concludes that doing so would be in the nation\u2019s security interest.The legislation also authorizes the president \u2014 but does not require him \u2014 to impose sanctions on international companies that invest in certain types of unconventional Russian crude-oil energy projects and to further restrict the export of equipment for use in Russia\u2019s energy sector. And it authorizes the president to bar investment or credit to Gazprom, the Russian state energy giant.In addition, the legislation authorizes the provision of lethal arms to the Ukraine government, including antitank weapons, tactical surveillance drones and counter-artillery radar. Mr. Obama has resisted sending weaponry to Kiev on the theory that it would only escalate the fighting in eastern Ukraine, so it is not clear whether he will follow through on the authorization.The measure went beyond only penalties to authorize $10 million in each of the next three fiscal years to counter Russian propaganda in the former Soviet Union and prioritize Russian-language broadcasting in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. And it authorized $20 million in each of the next three years to promote democracy, independent news media, uncensored Internet access and anticorruption efforts in Russia.But under pressure from the Obama administration, lawmakers removed elements that would have tied the president\u2019s hands, including a provision that would have barred lifting sanctions until Russia was not only out of Ukraine but Moldova and Georgia, too, where lingering conflicts are not likely to be resolved soon.\u201cPresident Putin bears responsibility for any outcomes that flow from his actions and breach of the international order,\u201d said Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who pushed for the sanctions along with the panel\u2019s senior Republican, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. \u201cThe United States Congress stands with Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression,\u201d Mr. Menendez said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Court Strikes Down Law Allowing Companies to Be Inherited Tax-Free", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Germany\u2019s highest court on Wednesday struck down a law allowing companies to be passed from generation to generation tax free, provoking an outcry from business groups who said the decision endangered the family-owned firms that are the backbone of the economy.The Federal Constitutional Court emphasized in its decision that it did not see a fundamental problem in giving tax breaks to family companies in order to preserve jobs, and it gave German lawmakers until the middle of 2016 to fix the aspects of inheritance law that it said provided unfair privileges to family heirs.Still, the decision struck at the core of Germany\u2019s image of itself as a nation of industrious, family-owned companies passed from one generation to the next, in some cases over centuries.Coverage of the decision dominated German media on Wednesday and prompted an immediate reaction from industry groups.Ulrich Grillo, president of the Federation of German Industries, said lawmakers should take steps to ensure that companies could remain within families. \u201cAnything else would endanger investment and jobs,\u201d Mr. Grillo said in a statement.Germany has 2.7 million family-owned or controlled companies, according to the Family Companies Foundation. While most family companies are small, more than 170 have revenue of at least 1 billion euros, or $1.25 billion.Often, much of the value of German companies consists of machinery or factory buildings that are not easily converted to cash to pay inheritance tax. Industry groups argued that people who inherited companies would be forced to sell out to private equity firms or other outside investors in order to pay taxes, and that the new owners might be more focused on short-term profit and less determined to preserve jobs in Germany.The tax break, however, has also faced criticism for being too broad and allowing wealthy people to avoid taxes.By some estimates, the tax break allowed heirs to avoid \u20ac40 billion in taxes during 2012. The court challenge was brought by a person, not identified in the decision, who inherited cash on which he had to pay a tax of 30 percent. He argued it was unfair for him to be required to pay more than people who inherited a company.Efforts to rewrite the law to conform with the high court\u2019s decision could create conflict within Germany\u2019s coalition government, which consists of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s right-of-center Christian Democrats and the left of center Social Democrats.Some Social Democratic lawmakers have said the law should be rewritten to allow family heirs to settle their taxes by giving stakes in their companies to the government \u2014 a proposal very unlikely to be acceptable to the Christian Democrats.Friederike von Tiesenhausen, a spokesman for the German Finance Ministry, said on Wednesday that the government planned early next year to invite representatives of German states to discuss how to revise the law.At issue were changes to tax rules in 2009 that allowed people who inherited ownership of companies to avoid 85 percent of inheritance taxes if they kept jobs stable for five years, and to pay no taxes at all if they preserved jobs for at least seven years.Firms with 20 employees or fewer \u2014 a category that includes 90 percent of all family-owned companies \u2014 were not required to preserve jobs to avoid the inheritance tax, however. The Constitutional Court judges said that exemption undercut the stated purpose of the law, and was unconstitutional because it favored some taxpayers over others without a legitimate justification.The judges said they had no problem with tax breaks that genuinely protected jobs and \u201cproductive wealth.\u201d\u201cFrom a constitutional point of view there is no doubt about the legitimacy of this objective,\u201d the judges said in their decision.The decision by the eight-judge panel was unanimous, but three members issued a supplementary decision saying the judgment should have included wording to ensure that revised tax rules did not undercut the basic purpose of inheritance law, which was to hinder excessive concentration of wealth among a privileged few.\u201cThe inheritance tax serves not only to generate tax revenue,\u201d wrote the judges, Susanne Baer, Reinhard Gaier and Johannes Masing. \u201cRather it is also an instrument of the state to hinder disproportionate accumulation of wealth from generation to generation solely as a result of origin or personal connection.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There will be no letup in the coming decades.\u201dSpurred partly by the tsunami, which the United Nations says killed more than 227,000 people, many countries have built early warning systems and other defenses against natural disasters, said Ms. Wahlstrom, the head of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.The perception among some developed countries that disasters mostly afflict poor countries has changed since Hurricanes Katrina in 2005 and Sandy in 2012, earthquakes in Italy, repeated heavy flooding in Central Europe and wildfires in the United States and Russia. \u201cEverywhere, things are going on that didn\u2019t go on 10 years ago,\u201d Ms. Wahlstrom said.While disaster responses have helped to reduce mortality from such events, their frequency and cost are spiraling up. \u201cEvents that we used to say happen once in a hundred years are happening every 20 years and soon maybe every 10 years,\u201d Ms. Wahlstrom said.Between 1970 and 2012, nearly two million people died in 8,835 disasters, according to a \u201cmortality atlas\u201d the United Nations produced this year, estimating the economic losses at $2.4 trillion. Although data is still imprecise, Ms. Wahlstrom said the United Nations and business accepted that natural disasters cost the global economy about $250 billion a year, probably much more.Moreover, those estimates do not take into account the long-term and indirect costs of disasters in the form of ruined businesses, unemployment, homelessness and health costs.Much of the work of the last decade has drawn on disaster risk measures established in the Hyogo Framework for Action, agreed to at a world conference held in the months after the Indian Ocean tsunami. The anniversary comes as the United Nations is preparing another world conference in March in Sendai, Japan, which was ravaged by the March 2011 tsunami.The Sendai conference is intended, Ms. Wahlstrom said, to give new urgency to identifying risk of disasters, setting new priorities for managing them and putting greater emphasis on preparing for \u201cthe most difficult part of any disaster,\u201d reconstruction.\u201cMany disaster experts say the biggest risk is when we forget,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when our defenses go down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In German City Rich With History and Tragedy, Tide Rises Against Immigration", "Date": "2014-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDresden JournalDRESDEN, Germany \u2014 As it does every Advent, this history-laden city has erected the gift stalls, the gl\u00fchwein stands and the Ferris wheel of Germany\u2019s oldest Christmas market, around the Frauenkirche, the 18th-century church that was magnificently rebuilt after the Allies\u2019 catastrophic bombing in 1945. But this year, there is tension behind the seasonal jollity.For the past seven Mondays, people have taken up the battle cry of East Germans protesting their Communist government 25 years ago \u2014 \u201cWir sind das Volk!\u201d (\u201cWe are the people!\u201d) \u2014 and fashioned it into a lament about being overlooked by political leaders of the present.First hundreds, now thousands have responded to the summons from a previously unknown activist, Lutz Bachmann, 41, and an organization called Pegida, a German acronym for a title that translates roughly as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West.On Monday, a record 7,500 showed up despite teeth-chattering cold, for an hourlong march through Dresden\u2019s center, a mix of grim Socialist architecture and gems of the pre-1945 past. National flags were flown. One placard said, \u201cWe miss our country,\u201d while another demanded, \u201cProtection of the Heimat,\u201d or homeland, \u201cnot Islamization.\u201dCarefully kept at shouting distance by the police, several hundred opponents yelled their disagreement. \u201cRefugees are welcome here!\u201d they chanted in English before blocking the Pegida crowd from reaching Dresden\u2019s famed Theater Square, bordered by the beautiful Semperoper opera house and the Zwinger museum, home to one of the finest European art collections.Despite its rich culture and its present-day prosperity, Dresden is no stranger to right-wingers or hatred of foreigners. But as dissatisfaction simmers throughout Europe over the arrival of migrants, events in this city of 530,000 people have come as a surprise.\u201cThey are clearly Nazis,\u201d said Kathi Wetzel, 50, when asked at her food stall about the demonstrators, though, she added, the marches also swept up \u201csimple hangers-on who don\u2019t really know why they are going along.\u201dMartin Landseck, 32, pouring beer at another stand, took a far less definite attitude. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see,\u201d he said, about which side has the better case.Clearly, Pegida has touched a nerve. In Germany, where the economy is still growing and more people have jobs than ever before, no equivalent has emerged to France\u2019s Marine LePen and her populist National Front, and no leaders have ridden discontent to power like Prime Minister Victor Orban in Hungary.The Islamization evoked by Pegida is hardly imminent, with only about 2 percent of the population in the Saxony region foreign, and only a fraction of those Muslim.But right-wingers and soccer hooligans banded together in Cologne this fall and overran police officers in violent protests they said were aimed at Islamic extremism. Dresden is almost the anti-Cologne \u2014 determinedly antiviolent and careful in its fliers and patriotic placards to stay on the right side of laws banning hate speech \u2014 yet focused on many of the same targets.In Pegida, \u201cObviously, we are dealing with a mixed group \u2014 known figures from the N.P.D., soccer hooligans, but also a sizable number of ordinary burghers,\u201d said Frank Richter, director of Saxony\u2019s state office for political education. He and other East Germans who marched against the Communist government in 1989 cringe at the new demonstrators\u2019 appropriation of the old rallying call. \u201cBut they obviously feel they have not been understood.\u201dSome see Dresden\u2019s xenophobia rooted in its Communist past. Before unification, the region was known as \u201cthe valley of the clueless,\u201d because it was the only major urban area in East Germany which could not receive West German television.And while the rest of Germany was absorbing Turks and other immigrants for decades, the East was largely isolated from foreigners.Werner Patzelt, a politics professor at Dresden\u2019s Technical University, noted that \u201cin the past 25 years, East German society underwent a huge process of transformation. People now feel that things are halfway back in order: the new system works, our towns look O.K. and we have jobs \u2014 and now there comes a whole new change and no one asked us.\u201dSince reunification in 1990, the N.P.D. has often won seats in the state legislature. While the N.P.D. fell short of the 5 percent hurdle to gain seats in the state legislature last fall, a new populist party, the Alternative for Germany, garnered almost 10 percent of the vote.Suspicion of Islam is not unique to eastern Germany, but it is potent, driven like elsewhere on the continent by the swelling of the Muslim population, the alarming flow of European Muslims to Syria or Iraq to wage jihad, and the growing fears that those jihadists might return to inflict harm on their adopted homelands.An announcement in the fall that 14 new facilities would open in Saxony for some 2,000 refugees \u2014 two this year, the others in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 may have been the final straw. At Monday\u2019s demonstration, four men in their 60s were unanimous about the danger. \u201cJust look at the Ruhr,\u201d said one, alluding to industrial cities of western Germany, where migrant ghettos are ever more common. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that here.\u201d\u201cOr Berlin,\u201d said a second. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to put barbed wire on our balconies,\u201d he said, insisting this was common in the capital to keep foreign burglars at bay. (It is not.)Many of the demonstrators refused to identify themselves or be interviewed. But Mr. Bachmann, their leader, eagerly shook hands with a reporter before the march, and insisted that his group is not against refugees from war zones, Islam or foreigners per se.\u201cWhat we don\u2019t like here\u201d are economic refugees mooching on the German system, he said. \u201cPoliticians in Germany, they did the whole thing wrong, basically wrong.\u201dThe local S\u00e4chsische Zeitung newspaper recently reported that Mr. Bachmann had several criminal convictions \u2014 16 burglaries, driving drunk or without a license and even dealing in cocaine. The report also noted that it was hard to pin down where and how Mr. Bachmann had lived, though it found that, among other things, he had done publicity for nightclubs.News of his record jars with his accusations that arriving foreigners spread crime, but Mr. Bachmann waved it off as a distraction.

{"Headline": "Strange Climate Event: Warmth Toward U.S.", "Date": "2014-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuddenly, all that has changed.At the global climate change negotiations now wrapping up in Peru, American negotiators are being met with something wildly unfamiliar: cheers, applause, thanks and praise.It is an incongruous moment, arriving at a time when so many aspects of American foreign policy are under fire.But in the arena of international climate change negotiations, it has fundamentally transformed the feeling toward his administration.\u201cThe U.S. is now credible on climate change,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, the French climate change ambassador to the United Nations, who is leading efforts to broker a new agreement to be signed by world leaders in Paris next year.Veterans of two decades of climate change negotiations called the turnaround in America\u2019s image profound.Mr. de Boer praised Secretary of State John Kerry, who worked for months to broker the joint announcement with China and has pushed to translate Mr. Obama\u2019s domestic action into commitments for similar action from other countries.Mr. Kerry attended the United Nations climate change talks for nearly 20 years as a senator, often as the only representative from Congress. On Thursday, a day before this two-week round of talks was set to conclude, Mr. Kerry arrived here greeted by a cheering crowd.\u201cEvery nation \u2014 I repeat, every nation \u2014 has a responsibility to do its part,\u201d Mr. Kerry said in a speech intended to spur negotiators. \u201cIf you are a big developed nation and you do not lead, you are part of the problem.\u201cI\u2019m proud that the U.S. has accepted responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going straight to the largest source of emissions.\u201dHe even cited the most contentious impact of the Obama administration\u2019s new rules \u2014 they are expected to shutter hundreds of coal-fired power plants.\u201cWe\u2019re going to take a bunch of them out of commission,\u201d he said.The day before, White House officials gave a detailed presentation on the new regulations to a standing-room-only crowd of international delegates and journalists. Janet McCabe, the senior Environmental Protection Agency official charged with drafting the regulations, appeared at the presentation on a video link, laying out in exhaustive detail how the new rules would work, at the federal and state levels.Negotiators and delegates from dozens of countries have peppered the Americans with questions about the new rules \u2014 from the technical details to their legal status, given that Mr. Obama has enacted the policy without new action from Congress. While that strategy has enraged Republicans and others in the United States, it has drawn praise from the other governments here.\u201cThe U.S. has shown, not only because of the announcement with China, but also the June 2 rule, the political will to move this process, even with the difficulty between the executive branch and Congress,\u201d said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the Peruvian environment minister, who is presiding over the Lima summit.In Washington, Mr. Obama\u2019s opponents are preparing a full-on assault of the regulation. Leading the charge is Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the incoming Senate majority leader. For Mr. McConnell, whose home state is a major coal producer and relies on coal-fired power plants for more than 90 percent of its electricity, the fight against Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules is personal.\u201cThis unrealistic plan, that the president would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in an emailed statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for more listening, and less job-destroying red tape. Easing the burden already created by E.P.A. regulations will continue to be a priority for me in the new Congress.\u201dFor now, despite the new Republican majority in the Senate, it appears unlikely that Mr. McConnell will be able to summon the votes necessary to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s rules \u2014 a point that American negotiators are making repeatedly here.This time, American officials continue to assure their counterparts that the United States will keep its word.Even negotiators who praise the new American and China emissions cuts warn that the measures will not come close to preventing the costly early impacts of global warming.The deal being worked out in Lima is expected to create a framework requiring all nations to put forward plans over the next six months to cut their own emissions. But those plans will be determined by the nations themselves, guided by their own domestic politics, not by the amount of reduction that scientists say is necessary. And they are not scheduled to be enacted until 2020.Tony deBrum, the foreign minister of the low-lying Marshall Islands, which are at risk of losing land and vital infrastructure to rising seas, praised Mr. Kerry and the lead American climate negotiator, Todd D. Stern, for meeting with him personally.\u201cThey have asked to hear the perspective of a small island nation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has given us confidence that they take our voice seriously.\u201cBut what has been announced is not enough,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shock in Southern Tier of New York as Hopes of Gambling and Fracking Both Die", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was two letters, in red type: \u201cNO!\u201dThat cry could seemingly be heard all along New York State\u2019s Southern Tier, which borders Pennsylvania and has long been one of the state\u2019s most stubborn economic laggards. In recent years, both hydraulic fracturing \u2014 known as fracking \u2014 and casinos had been posited as potential economic saviors here, where residents and leaders have watched with envy as neighboring Pennsylvanians dived into both industries.All of which left residents here shaking their heads in disbelief.\u201cThe casinos went down, fracking went down \u2014 come on; this place is dead in the water now,\u201d said Pat Shea, 64, a retired parks employee drinking coffee in a McDonald\u2019s on a day when the weather outside seemed to mirror the local mood: cold, blustery, and sunless. \u201cThis whole area was thumbed at, snubbed, like it was nothing.\u201dSouthern Tier officials echoed that complaint, saying the rest of the state had basically written off their region.\u201cThere were two major issues that had the potential to either jump-start the economy or have significant economic impact in the true Southern Tier of New York,\u201d said Mayor Richard C. David of Binghamton, a Republican. \u201cAnd both those doors were closed yesterday.\u201dFor some, the rejection was an especially bitter pill from the Cuomo administration. The governor, a Democrat, had traveled to Binghamton in November 2013 just after passage of a state referendum expanding gambling statewide and called it \u201ca big win for local governments, school districts and taxpayers in the Eastern Southern Tier region.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Cuomo said that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d the Southern Tier needed economic development, but that it could not come at the expense of public health, as officials had warned of fracking. As for the casino board\u2019s decision, Mr. Cuomo said he had not had a role in it. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they made what decisions they made,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t my place to interfere, and I don\u2019t want to second-guess them now.\u201dOne of the local leaders praising Mr. Cuomo last fall was State Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Republican from Binghamton who has had a warm working relationship with the governor. But in a radio interview on WCNY on Thursday, Mr. Libous sounded shellshocked.\u201cWe\u2019re hurting,\u201d he said, adding of the casino: \u201cI can\u2019t believe that one of those two proposals couldn\u2019t have been accepted. We\u2019re going to have to regroup.\u201d From one end of Binghamton to another, and up and down the economic ladder, residents voiced their disbelief.At the white-napkin Binghamton Club, Frederick Russell, a 60-year-old financial adviser with a Monopoly Man mustache, said he was amazed by how far the region had fallen.Mr. Russell said he remembered the region\u2019s heyday, when jobs were plentiful with employers like General Electric and I.B.M. and in industries ranging from furniture to shoes.\u201cAt one time, Broome County had a dome over it,\u201d he said. The dual decisions only made the sense of a downward trajectory more acute. \u201cIt was like a whammy,\u201d Mr. Russell said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Well, Binghamton, you\u2019re so far down we don\u2019t care about you anymore, so just disappear.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Russell credited Mr. Cuomo, however, with his attention to the state\u2019s university system \u2014 including Binghamton University, a State University of New York campus \u2014 and regional economic development grants.Another member was less forgiving. \u201cHis political career comes first,\u201d said Kent Turner, 83, a lifelong Southern Tier resident and a Republican. Nearby outside Fitzie\u2019s bar, Dominique Cataldi, 29, and Ursula Sutton, 30, smoked cigarettes in a howling, frigid wind near the Chenango River, which runs through the heart of the city. Ms. Sutton, a bartender, said she was skeptical of the safety of fracking, but thought there could have been a way to monitor it so landowners and farmers could benefit from lucrative leases to energy companies. \u201cA lot of the people they approach are struggling for money,\u201d she said. Ms. Cataldi, who lives in Ithaca, in the Finger Lakes, was more circumspect. \u201cThe reason the area is so depressed is that it\u2019s so depressing here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gray and miserable.\u201d Nursing his coffee at McDonald\u2019s, Mr. Shea, the retiree, recalled a time when a young man in Binghamton could quit a job in the morning \u201cand have another one by 1 o\u2019clock.\u201d\u201cThis area was a premier place,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Who Wants to Buy a Politician?", "Date": "2014-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyDon Blankenship, the recently indicted former chief executive of Massey Energy, has a history of donating a lot of money to West Virginia politicians. In 2004, for instance, Blankenship spent $3 million to support the election of a lawyer named Brent Benjamin to the state\u2019s Supreme Court of Appeals. It was, notably, more than three times the amount spent by Benjamin\u2019s own campaign. But for Blankenship, it appeared to be a beneficial investment. Once seated, Benjamin cast the deciding vote to overturn a $50million jury verdict against Massey.Spending on election campaigns has long been considered a pretty good way for people and companies, who have money, to influence politicians, who need it. That\u2019s why the government spent the better part of a century imposing various restrictions on such spending. But in recent years, federal courts have knocked down many of these barriers: A series of decisions, most notably the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 ruling in the Citizens United case, now effectively allow people and companies to spend as much as they like. Soon after the Citizens ruling, experts forecast that a flood of money would follow. And in some elections, it has. In last month\u2019s midterms, competitive United States Senate races in North Carolina and Colorado each drew more than $100million in estimated spending, the first time any congressional races have crossed that line.Such extravagance, however, is proving to be the exception. Even the 2012 presidential election, which recorded $2.6 billion in campaign spending, underperformed many forecasts. And spending has declined in each of the last two congressional elections. Candidates and other interested parties spent $3.7 billion on this year\u2019s midterms, down from an inflation-adjusted total of $3.8 billion in 2012, which was less than the $4 billion spent in2010, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. (These figures do not include a few hundred million dollars in unreported spending on issue ads.) In fact, spending has dropped as the economy has grown and despite a series of contests in which at least one house of Congress was plausibly at stake. \u201cDire warnings rang out that the decision would herald a new era in politics,\u201d wrote Adam Bonica, a Stanford University political scientist, in a 2013 paper about the effects of Citizens United. \u201cThree years on, there is little evidence that these predictions have come to pass.\u201d Over the past year, Americans spent more on almonds than on selecting their representatives in Congress.Stephen Ansolabehere, a professor of government at Harvard University, says that the facts are surprising only if we subscribe to an incorrect view. In a 2003 paper, \u201cWhy Is There So Little Money in U.S.Politics?\u201d he argued that people and corporations actually view giving money as an ineffective way to influence politicians. Donations, Ansolabehere says, are best understood as a form of consumption, akin to making a charitable contribution. Donors are supporting a cause they believe in, and they take pleasure in doing so. \u201cWe basically think that giving money makes you feel good,\u201d Ansolabehere told me.Most campaign money, after all, comes in smaller chunks from individual donors. People who gave $3 to Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008 could not have reasonably expected that their small contributions would influence the future president. Even those who give larger sums rarely contribute the maximum allowed by law, as might be expected of someone trying to buy influence. Instead, individual contributions have increased over time merely in proportion to personal income. Excepting lower-income families, who rarely give to campaigns, Americans from the upper-middle class on up give approximately the same percentage of their income, about 0.04 percent, according to Ansolabehere\u2019s research, to politicians and political groups. Corporations also spend relatively little, and their spending has not increased substantially in recent years. \u201cIf companies thought they could just buy politicians,\u201d said Timothy Groseclose, an economics professor at George Mason University, \u201cwe should see much more money being spent there.\u201dIn reality, examples like the Massey Energy case are rare. And in 2009, the Supreme Court ordered the West Virginia courts to reconsider its verdict. That year, Blankenship told Adam Liptak of The Times, \u201cI\u2019ve been around West Virginia long enough to know that politicians don\u2019t stay bought.\u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy noted in his Citizens United opinion that 100,000 pages of briefs had not included a single clear example of a quid pro quo purchase of a lawmaker\u2019s vote.One reason is that buying elections is economically inefficient. Most voters, like most consumers, have defined preferences that are difficult for advertisers to shift. Chevron spent roughly $3 million during a recent campaign backing, certain City Council candidates in Richmond, Calif., where it operates a major refinery. Voters instead chose a slate of candidates who want to raise taxes. \u201cCampaign spending has an extremely small impact on election outcomes, regardless of who does the spending,\u201d the University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt concluded in a 1994 paper. He found that spending an extra $100,000 in a House race might be expected to increase a candidate\u2019s vote total by about 0.33 percentage points. Investors appear to agree that companies can\u2019t make money by investing in political campaigns. A 2004 study found that changes in campaign-finance laws had no discernible impact on the share prices of companies that made donations.The low level of campaign spending, however, may obscure the real power of wealthy individuals and corporations. Michael Munger, a professor of political science at Duke University, told me that companies are mostly satisfied with the status quo, so they behave more like firefighters than like police officers. Instead of getting involved in each campaign, in other words, they sit back and wait for an alarm to ring. \u201cIncumbents and large corporations can basically spend as much as it would take to defeat some change that would harm them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd most of the time that is zero. But the potential is basically infinite.\u201d They spend around 10 times as much on lobbying, suggesting that it\u2019s less effective to influence the selection of policy makers than to influence the policy-making process itself. \u201cIf you can give a key piece of information to a politician,\u201d Groseclose told me, \u201cthat seems to be more valuable than a campaign contribution.\u201dThere may also be limits on how much money congressional campaigns can truly spend. House elections would presumably be more expensive if seats in Congress were directly available for sale. Campaign spending, however, is focused on influencing voters, and the prices for most of the necessary materials \u2014 people, paper, advertising time \u2014 are set in a broader marketplace, which keeps prices under control. During the midterms, television stations in several contested markets reported that they had sold all of their available slots. One station in New Hampshire actually issued refunds after selling more ads than it could air.Moreover, carefully drawn district maps limit the number of competitive House races, and control of available resources has shifted from candidates to national groups that focus on those races. Americans may be spending more on almonds than on elections, in other words, because in a growing number of races there is effectively nothing to buy.Binyamin Appelbaum is an economics reporter at\nThe Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Francis, a Bolder Vision of Vatican Diplomacy Emerges", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe work of an ambassador lies in small steps, small things, but they always end up making peace, bringing closer the hearts of people, sowing brotherhood among people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is your job, but with little things, tiny things.\u201dYet if the Vatican has long practiced a methodical, discreet brand of diplomacy, what has changed under Francis \u2014 or has been restored \u2014 is a vision of diplomatic boldness, a willingness to take risks and insert the Vatican into diplomatic disputes, especially where it can act as an independent broker.Even as the Vatican has spent decades building trust in Cuba, and working steadily to break down the impasse with the United States, it was Francis who took the fateful risks \u2014 writing secret letters to President Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba, and then offering the Vatican for a secret and critical meeting between both sides in October.Just as John Paul, the first Polish pope, had a unique credibility as a voice against Communism in Eastern Europe, so, too, does Francis \u2014 the first Latin American pope \u2014 now benefit from a unique credibility in the developing world.\u201cThere are elements to Francis that are John Paul-esque,\u201d said Francis Campbell, a former British ambassador to the Holy See, adding that Francis had embraced the bully pulpit provided by the papacy. \u201cThe papacy is one of the world\u2019s great opinion formers. Whether people agree with it or disagree with it, it has a huge voice.\u201dFrancis has also inherited longstanding Vatican standoffs, including with Saudi Arabia, and especially China, where the Holy See and the Chinese government are engaged in a decades-old diplomatic impasse over which side will control bishops in China\u2019s state-sanctioned Catholic churches.The delicacy of the China issue was evident last week, when Francis refused to meet the Dalai Lama, apparently to avoid offending the Chinese, who regard the Tibetan spiritual leader as an enemy.Yet, judging from his itinerary, Francis is pushing to establish the Vatican as a trusted diplomatic broker. In less than two years as pope, he has already traveled to the Middle East, Turkey, South Korea, Brazil, Albania, France and the Italian island of Lampedusa, where he called attention to the plight of migrants. Next month, he will travel to Sri Lanka and the Philippines, and next fall he will make his first visit to the United States.11 PhotosFrancis has revamped the bureaucracy, delegating financial tasks to a new economy ministry while appointing diplomats to key posts elsewhere, most notably his second-in-command, Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, an Italian cardinal who has led delicate Vatican negotiations with Vietnam and served as apostolic nuncio, or ambassador, in Venezuela.Unlike during the Benedict era, Francis and Cardinal Parolin are seen as working in tandem \u2014 the charismatic pope and the methodical diplomat.\u201cThis pope governs together with the secretary of state \u2014 he doesn\u2019t let him act separately and independently like before,\u201d said Paolo Rodari, a Vatican expert at La Repubblica, an Italian newspaper. He added that Francis had quickly built a rapport with world leaders. \u201cHe establishes relationships very easily,\u201d he said.In the past, the Vatican was often regarded by the non-Western world as aligned with Europe or the United States. An Argentine, Francis has regularly sought to place himself in a more neutral position, often in subtle ways.Speaking to journalists on the papal airplane after his trip to Turkey, Francis did not hesitate to criticize the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, yet he also spoke empathetically about the negative perceptions, linked to terrorism, that are often endured by Muslims.\u201cSo many Muslims feel offended; they say: \u2018But that is not what we are. The Quran is a prophetic book of peace. This isn\u2019t Islam,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cI can understand this.\u201dEven so, analysts said Catholic leaders had continued to nudge the Cuban government for change. During the 1990s, several American bishops made regular forays to Cuba, criticizing the blockade and placing attention on the difficulties faced by ordinary people.Cardinal Ortega also happened to be in Rome on Oct. 3 and met with Francis, according to Vatican records, raising the possibility that he, too, attended the secret October meeting that is credited with sealing the diplomatic deal.\u201cOrtega has always pushed for a gradual reform of the regime, for opening up, but at the same time he has been a trustworthy partner for the government \u2014 and with the full support of John Paul II, Benedict and Francis,\u201d said Marco Politi, an author and veteran Vatican analyst.In the end, though, it was Francis who helped engineer the final breakthrough. \u201cFrancis has brought back the Holy See on the international stage,\u201d Mr. Politi said.Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.C.B.\u2019s Draghi Hints at More Stimulus in Future for Europe", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe have a mandate. We don\u2019t tolerate prolonged deviations from our mandate,\u201d Mr. Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, said at a news conference. \u201cNot to pursue our mandate would be illegal.\u201dBut it has been almost two years since the eurozone\u2019s central bank last achieved its inflation target of about 2 percent. Inflation has fallen steadily since then, and it is now close to zero.The question is how long the European Central Bank and Mr. Draghi can merely hint at actions yet to come. There were already signs of doubt on Thursday, as European stocks were down broadly even before Mr. Draghi\u2019s news conference ended.\u201cAt some point, they will lose credibility,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThey still have time, but time is running out.\u201dMr. Draghi said that the European Central Bank would reassess its stimulus measures early next year and that its governing council \u201cremains unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate.\u201dThat statement was nearly identical to ones he made in October and November.And Mr. Draghi refused to specify what kind of assets the central bank was likely to buy, saying only that many options had been discussed. He did not commit to taking action in January, when the governing council will next meet on monetary policy.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean at the next meeting,\u201d he said of the possibility of an asset-purchase program. The decision would depend on how inflation developed and other factors, including the effect of the steep decline in oil prices, he said.Low inflation can make it difficult for companies to raise prices to cover their costs. That in turn can lead businesses to cut wages and discourage them from hiring. Deflation can create a self-perpetuating stagnation of the sort that has troubled Japan in recent decades.The European Central Bank has not been idle during the last two years. It has cut its benchmark interest rate seven times under Mr. Draghi to its current low of 0.05 percent, or effectively zero. The central bank left the rate unchanged on Thursday.It has taken the virtually unprecedented stop of introducing a negative interest rate on money that commercial banks store at the central bank, to induce them to lend the funds. And it has allowed banks to borrow money on extremely favorable terms for up to four years. The central bank is set to issue another round of cheap four-year loans next week.The central bank intends to expand the balance sheet by 1 trillion euros, or $1.23 trillion. From Oct. 20, when the purchases began, through Nov. 28, the central bank spent \u20ac18.2 billion buying private sector assets.One rationale for the European Central Bank\u2019s hesitation to embark on a big bond-buying program is that it wants to give the earlier measures a chance to work before taking more controversial steps. A decision to buy government bonds, an essential component of a quantitative easing program, would be deeply unpopular in Germany and could provoke a split among the 24 members of the governing council. Such purchases would also prompt legal challenges.Mr. Draghi said the central bank was prepared to act even if the decision was not unanimous, suggesting that quantitative easing could begin over the objections of Germany. But he also seemed to hold out hope that the Germans on the governing council and other skeptics could be brought on board.\u201cWe don\u2019t need unanimity,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cI believe it can be designed to have consensus. I\u2019m still confident.\u201dHe indicated that the planning was already underway, saying, \u201cTechnical preparations have been stepped up for further measures, which could be implemented in a timely manner, if needed.\u201dMr. Draghi also had an answer to economists who have questioned whether large-scale asset purchases would be an effective way to lift the inflation rate. The doubters cite the eurozone\u2019s fragmented financial markets and lack of a widely traded, low-risk asset similar to the United States Treasury securities that the Fed has bought in its quantitative easing program.\u201cThere is enough evidence to say it could be effective,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.But that statement raised questions about why, in that case, the European Central Bank has not already acted \u2014 especially considering that its own economists issued more pessimistic forecasts on Thursday.Inflation in the eurozone next year will be 0.7 percent on average, the staff economists said, compared with a forecast of 1.1 percent as recently as September. And growth in 2015 will be only 1 percent, the central bank economists said, compared with an earlier forecast of 1.6 percent.\u201cMr. Draghi\u2019s ability to buoy financial markets through his words (and his words alone) is diminishing with each passing day,\u201d Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said by email. \u201cThe E.C.B.\u2019s inability to take meaningful action to avert the threat of deflation could become the trigger for a much more pronounced deterioration in market sentiment towards the eurozone.\u201dThe annual rate of inflation in the eurozone last month was 0.3 percent. Inflation is expected to fall further this month, perhaps to zero, because of declines in oil prices.The eurozone has narrowly avoided slipping back into recession. But growth remains too weak to make a significant dent in the unemployment rate, which was 11.5 percent in October.Mr. Draghi and other members of the governing council may be hoping that the drop in oil prices will help economic growth so that purchases of government bonds may not be necessary. But the longer the bank waits, the greater the risk that low inflation or deflation could become entrenched.\u201cThe eurozone economy is flat on its back and flirting with recession,\u201d said Mr. Zandi, the Moody\u2019s Analytics economist. \u201cThey still can avoid full-blown, outright eurozone deflation.

{"Headline": "Citing Budget, Minnesota-Duluth Cuts Ties With Women\u2019s Hockey Coach", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShannon Miller, the longtime women\u2019s hockey coach at Minnesota-Duluth, met last week with the university\u2019s chancellor, Lendley C. Black, and its athletic director, Josh Berlo, to discuss her expiring contract. With Duluth facing a $6 million budget deficit, Miller, the highest-paid N.C.A.A. Division I women\u2019s hockey coach at $207,000 a year, was prepared to take a pay cut. \u201cI assumed I\u2019m walking into a meeting where we\u2019re going to communicate open and honestly and come up with a win-win,\u201d Miller said Tuesday in a telephone interview.Instead, Miller was told that she, her two assistant coaches and her part-time hockey operations director \u2014 all women \u2014 would not be retained after the season. So Miller, who leads all women\u2019s hockey coaches with five N.C.A.A. championships and ranks fourth in victories with 375, will be looking for work after 16 seasons as the Duluth team\u2019s only head coach.The timing of the decision \u2014 after the sixth-ranked Bulldogs (12-5-3) had won 12 of 13 games and just before final exams \u2014 angered Miller, who called it \u201camoral and really stupid.\u201d Miller said that she and her staff planned to finish the season and that she had retained a lawyer who specialized in Title IX and gender-equity cases. \u201cIt think it\u2019s pretty clear what direction we\u2019re going,\u201d Miller, 51, said. Berlo, a former ticketing and marketing executive at Notre Dame, called the decision difficult and strictly financial. Berlo said he could not make Miller a fair offer without knowing next year\u2019s budget, which he would not have for several months.\u201cWe\u2019re closing in on our first balanced budget in at least a decade,\u201d said Berlo, who helped raise $1.3 million for the athletic department in the last fiscal year. \u201cWe still have significant budget challenges ahead.\u201d The next coach will probably make less than the next-highest-paid women\u2019s coaches in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association: Mark Johnson of Wisconsin ($164,000) and Brad Frost of Minnesota ($155,000), who combined for six of the last nine N.C.A.A. titles.Miller\u2019s contract, Berlo said, required that she be given six months\u2019 notice if the university decided not to renew it. (Miller disputed that claim, saying the lead assistant Laura Schuler\u2019s contract, not hers, contained that provision.)The decision brought criticism inside and outside Duluth. A Facebook page, \u201cStand With Coach Miller and Staff,\u201d drew more than 1,100 \u201clikes\u201d within its first 18 hours. Nicole M. LaVoi, the associate director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls and Women in Sport, said Miller\u2019s dismissal presented a new barrier to aspiring women coaches: salary, not success, determining job security. \u201cIt\u2019s a little far-fetched, but nobody would tell Nick Saban, \u2018You get paid too much; we can\u2019t keep you anymore,\u2019\u00a0\u201d LaVoi said. \u201cIt\u2019s troublesome on so many levels.\u201dMen\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey are the only Division I sports among the 14 offered at Duluth. All the others are Division II. Berlo said only men\u2019s hockey paid for itself. The men\u2019s coach, Scott Sandelin, makes $265,000, which Berlo termed about average for Division I.Sandelin\u2019s contract runs through 2017, and Berlo would not rule out asking Sandelin or other coaches with expiring contracts to take pay cuts.Miller received her last contract extension in 2010 \u2014 for the 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons \u2014 after winning her fifth national title. It came shortly before Kathryn A. Martin, then the chancellor, who had hired Miller and was known as a boisterous supporter of women\u2019s hockey, retired. Miller said the university had treated men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey differently since then.At the time of her extension, Miller made $170,000 \u2014 about the same as Sandelin \u2014 and was due a $10,000 raise for 2010-11. Miller said she and other Duluth employees accepted 1.5 percent salary rollbacks because of the struggling economy. In 2011, when Sandelin won his first N.C.A.A. title and received his extension, Duluth awarded him a $65,000 raise, to $235,000. By the summer of 2013, declining enrollment, cuts in state aid and other issues left Duluth with an $11.9 million budget deficit. Still, last year the university spent almost twice as much on men\u2019s hockey ($533,322) as on women\u2019s ($259,590), according to the United States Department of Education\u2019s Equity in Athletic Data Analysis database. The Duluth women\u2019s team had missed the N.C.A.A. tournament in three consecutive seasons \u2014 a program first \u2014 when Miller first approached Berlo and Black last spring about an extension. They met again in July, when Miller said she was open to a pay cut. She said Black promised to consider a mutually acceptable solution. In last week\u2019s meeting, Miller said that Berlo and Black suggested that she retire, which she refused because, she said, \u201cI\u2019d never get another job.\u201dMiller said she gathered her players in the basement of her home last Friday to tell them.\u201cThe way they approached it is an absolute joke,\u201d the senior forward Jenna McPartland told The Duluth News Tribune. \u201cWhat kind of coach doesn\u2019t get a renewed contract with five national championships, and you\u2019ve won 12 of your last 13 games?\u201d That is what Miller wants to know. \u201cThey should be applauding us for how well we do, not firing us,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But this time, Mr. Orlowski said, the drops seen in recent days in the Polish zloty, the Hungarian forint and other currencies seem within the range of normal fluctuations.The effect on regional trade, though, could be serious, economists say, depending on how long the crisis lasts and how deep the coming Russian recession proves to be.\u201cRussian imports are going to be smaller and Russian investment abroad is going to be more hesitant,\u201d said Miroslav Prokopijevic, an economic analyst in Belgrade, Serbia.The impact, though, will differ depending on how much each nation relies on Russian trade and on Russian visitors, who are more likely to stay home now that the cost of foreign travel has shot up. The Baltics, which rely heavily on both, will suffer a larger hit than nations like Romania, which has little trade with Russia.In tiny Moldova, one of the poorest nations in Europe and a former Soviet Republic, a quarter of the country\u2019s gross domestic product comes from money sent back by residents living abroad, many of them in Russia.\u201cVaclav Havel once said: \u2018Are you asking what to do to help the Czech Republic? I respond, help Russia,'\u201d said Tomas Sedlacek, chief macroeconomic specialist at CSOB, a Czech bank, referring to the former Czech president. \u201cIt is fairly paradoxical to remind ourselves of this today, when the world observes Russia\u2019s troubles with a certain satisfaction. I endorse the current sanctions, but an unstable and angry Russia is not what we should wish for.\u201d\u201cSuch rapid weakening of the ruble, if continued, will have a more significant impact on the Lithuanian economy than the previous embargo on food products,\u201d said Vaiva Seckute, a Lithuanian specialist at Swedbank.In Poland, with the largest economy in the region, embargoes had already reduced exports to Russia by 10 percent.But there is the potential, if the crisis persists, for exports to Russia from Central Europe to drop as much as 20 or 30 percent, Mr. Orlowski said.\u201cThat would have an impact on G.D.P. of noticeable size,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the case of Poland, the Czech Republic, in the region of a half percent to 1 percent.\u201dSome of the impact on everyday life may be mitigated by the fall in oil prices that helped precipitate the Russian crisis and should result in lower energy costs.What many outside the region fail to appreciate, Mr. Orlowski said, is how much national economies have reoriented economically, as well as politically, since joining the European Union. Trade with Russia accounts for 5 percent of Polish exports, for instance, a significant chunk, but trade with Germany and the rest of Western Europe is 15 times larger.\u201cThe greater danger is that this will affect the public mood in Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cWe in Poland are very much afraid of this, because a 3 percent drop in exports to Western Europe is much more important for us than a 30 percent drop in our exports to Russia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chris Christie Stumps for Energy, if Not for 2016, in Canada", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCALGARY, Alberta \u2014 It was not exactly subtle, Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s bear-hugging embrace here of the Keystone XL Pipeline, the most contested cross-border energy project in a generation.Determined to let no doubts about his enthusiasm for the pipeline linger, Mr. Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, traveled to Canada to meet with the chief executive of the company trying to build it. He held a joint news conference with the premier of Alberta, who is aggressively pushing for it. And Mr. Christie delivered a speech to a group of Canadian energy executives who fervently support it \u2014 inside the Calgary Petroleum Club, no less.\u201cOn the merits, Keystone should have been approved a long time ago,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cIt is time \u2014 well over time \u2014 to get this done.\u201dIn a way, it was Mr. Christie\u2019s \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d moment, intended to highlight his unequivocal commitment to an issue that has united a fractious Republican Party. At a time when his party is agonizing over big questions like immigration policy, its warring constituencies have coalesced around Keystone, a pipeline system designed to carry up to 830,000 barrels of petroleum a day from western Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.As Mr. Christie weighs a presidential run, his trip here seemed calibrated to appeal to two crucial Republican constituencies: the elite corporate donors who loathe President Obama\u2019s inaction on the pipeline, and the grass-roots Republican activists who are convinced that it is vital to American energy independence.Mr. Christie, who has limited experience in international affairs, is fashioning a foreign policy that is heavily grounded in North America, which he views as an overlooked domain in an era of international threats to the United States. It is an approach shaped heavily by informal advisers, including Robert B. Zoellick, the former United States trade representative under President George W. Bush, who said in an recent interview that he has encouraged Mr. Christie to think about the \u201ccontinental base.\u201d\u201cOn this continent,\u201d Mr. Christie said, \u201cCanada, the United States and Mexico share a political system, share an approach to the economy, share similar cultural values, share a respect for each other\u2019s national sovereignty and share a belief that freedom and democracy should be offered to people all across the world. Think about it today: Is there another neighborhood in the world that offers that?\u201dMuch of his vision hinges on energy. With American production of oil and natural gas reaching record-breaking levels, Mexico\u2019s opening up its long-nationalized reserves to outside investment and Canada awash in oil money, Mr. Christie says he foresees a \u201cNorth American energy renaissance.Its missing link, he said, is Keystone.\u201cYou know, in the United States, we already have over 2.2 million miles of pipeline. Canada has tens of thousands of miles of pipelines,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cIn both cases, the safety record is sound.\u201dA commitment to building the pipeline has stalled in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The pipeline may be approved next year, however, when the Republicans take control. But on an issue that has divided Canadians and Americans, Mr. Christie seemed disinclined to hear from opponents, speaking only to a corporate crowd heavily invested in the project\u2019s approval. \u201cYou won\u2019t find any protester in here,\u201d said Robert Merrifield, Alberta\u2019s representative to the United States. He said that Mr. Obama was \u201crunning out of excuses\u201d for not approving Keystone. Mr. Christie\u2019s combative, improvisational style has prompted Republican leaders to question his aptitude for presidential-level diplomacy. But in Canada, he took pains to strike a low-key and humble tone, just as he did in Mexico a few months ago. \u201cI am here to listen and learn,\u201d he said. He briefly suspended that decorum when the topic turned to United States politics. Murray Smith, a former Canadian government official, suggested that Mr. Christie declare his candidacy for president while in Calgary.Mr. Christie shook his head in mock horror, calling it terrible advice. Were he to run, he said, \u201cmy instinct would be to announce it in the United States.\u201dHe playfully counseled Mr. Murray to keep his political advice to himself. \u201cAs my friend Donald Trump would say, \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company has offered her co-workers a choice: If she is laid off, all of them will receive the 1,000 euro ($1,200) bonuses they have long been promised; if they agree to give up the bonuses, she can keep her job.A vote has already been held among the 16 members of Sandra\u2019s work team, but her boss agrees to a second ballot. This gives Sandra a weekend \u2014 two days and one night, as the film\u2019s title says \u2014 to persuade a majority of her colleagues to make a painful sacrifice on her behalf.Sandra and her husband, Manu (Fabrizio Rongione), live with their two young children in a clean, well-appointed townhouse, a big, hard-won step up from the \u201csocial housing\u201d where they used to live. The thought of going back is especially galling to Manu, who works in the kitchen of a chain restaurant and who pushes his wife to make her case. Anxious, frequently tearful and quick to reach for a Xanax, Sandra would rather curl up in bed than endure the humiliation of begging for the pity of her peers. \u201cTwo Days, One Night\u201d consists almost entirely of encounters between Sandra and the people who have, through no choice of their own, been given the power to decide her fate. The key to the movie \u2014 what makes it moving as well as grueling, thrilling as well as harsh \u2014 is that the Dardennes refuse to skip or cut away from a single meeting. Like Sandra, the audience must absorb the emotional impact of each conversation. Most begin politely, but after the initial handshakes and greetings, the reactions to Sandra\u2019s pleas vary wildly. There are anger, compassion, evasiveness and shame. A man bursts into tears. A fistfight breaks out. A marriage comes undone. A blunt refusal is followed by an offer of orange juice.A lot more than money is at stake, but the Dardennes never underestimate the importance of money in the lives of their characters. That 1,000 euros will help pay for school tuition, for home repairs, for children\u2019s clothes and mortgages. Nobody is rich or greedy, though some people are perhaps more selfish than others. The leisure of a summer weekend is, mostly, a time for more work: fixing the car, coaching soccer, toiling at a second job, looking after the kids. Work, for Sandra and her fellow citizens of the Dardenne Republic, is an irreplaceable source of meaning, identity and happiness. \u201cTwo Days, One Night\u201d is about the erosion of all of those values, and also about the waning of solidarity in the modern economy. In the past, the quality of life that workers like Sandra and Manu enjoy might have been secured through collective struggle. Now, the film suggests, it is maintained through individual competition among the workers themselves. This is a grim and painful reality \u2014 not only in Belgium \u2014 but the Dardennes are too committed to the dignity of their characters to set themselves up as merchants of despair. \u201cTwo Days, One Night\u201d does not paint a pretty picture of the world as it is now. Partly for that reason \u2014 and partly because of the gravity and grace of its star \u2014 it\u2019s a beautiful movie. \u201cTwo Days, One Night\u201d is rated PG-13. Hard times, hard feelings.

The Russians have also, officially, claimed to have had no role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Some Western countries seem to have accepted this arrangement, which Finns point out was never really one of their choosing.Germany\u2019s foreign minister said, for example, that North Atlantic Treaty Organization membership for Ukraine was off the agenda.And yet some Ukrainians argue that no elected Ukrainian government could accept such a deal and that Ukraine might more easily simply part with the area now occupied by pro-Russian separatists, a zone of industrial blight and a subsidized coal industry.The government cut off banking services, halted payments of pensions and told businesses to relocate. The Ukrainian Army is digging trenches and laying barbed wire on defensible high ground to the west.Russia has faulted Ukraine\u2019s policy of halting public sector payments and financial services in the occupied areas, given the unstated implication that Russia should pick up those bills now, however weak its own economy.Surprisingly, so have separatist officials, who call the Ukrainian approach a policy of \u201ceconomic blockade.\u201dThe delay in talks came as the Luhansk and Donetsk groups, which call themselves people\u2019s republics, declined to attend the talks on Tuesday unless lifting the economic blockade was included as a condition of the cease-fire. Luhansk officials asked that the negotiations be rescheduled for Friday.In a positive sign, Russia and Ukraine resumed trading Tuesday in the politically hued natural gas market. Ukraine imported Russian gas for the first time since spring, under terms negotiated with European mediation.In the east, artillery shells fell overnight into the snowy Kuibyshev district of the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, but then halted in the morning, Russian television reported, while on the Ukrainian side, six soldiers died in the 24 hours before the silent day began, the Ukrainian military said.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of the geopolitical alliance that Ukraine wants to join.

She instead went farther afield \u2014 to Hong Kong.Ms. M\u00fcller\u2019s employer, the Elea Foundation for Ethics in Globalization, a Zurich investment fund focusing on sustainable development, granted her a leave of absence and guaranteed her job would be there when she came back. Ms. M\u00fcller evaluated well-ranked universities and agreed with her employer that she needed to focus on a top-tier program.\u201cIf you\u2019re a lawyer or a doctor, your title is secured,\u201d she said. \u201cAn M.B.A. isn\u2019t like that. It matters how high the school is ranked. Ms. M\u00fcller studied global university rankings and eventually narrowed her choices to Northwestern University, Stanford University, Babson College and a school in Singapore. She concluded that many of the M.B.A. programs were pretty similar.Ultimately, Ms. M\u00fcller said traditional American universities were not as appealing to her as Asian programs, so she chose the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for its focus on Asia and its proximity to China, which she said was \u201cthe salt in the soup.\u201d Over the past few years, Asian universities have steadily moved up the global rankings \u2014 as illustrated in the latest edition of a listing that focuses on the overall \u201cemployability\u201d of graduates in the global economy, compiled by the French consulting firm Emerging and the German research group Trendence. And with more foreign schools offering full programs in English, the lingua franca of international business, students like Ms. M\u00fcller are increasingly pursuing advanced degrees in far-flung places.While other lists, like the Shanghai Ranking, focus on the quality of a university\u2019s academics and research, the Emerging-Trendence study, a copy of which was provided to The International New York Times, rates institutions based on recruiters\u2019 opinions of how attractive graduates are to potential employers. Even though recruiters agreed that the American schools produced the best \u201cready for work\u201d graduates, the United States and Britain are no longer the go-to bastions of higher education for English-speaking students. The University of Tokyo, the highest-ranking Asian university in the survey for example, held its number 10 spot this year just ahead of Columbia University, which dropped from 7 to 11. Continuing the trend in last year\u2019s listing, institutions in Asia rose again in the esteem of employers this year to occupy 20 percent of the Emerging-Trendence ranking. That is double the region\u2019s presence on the list when the first report was issued in 2011. Chinese universities climbed an average of five spots and added two new schools to claim a total of seven places. The Emerging-Trendence list put Ms. M\u00fcller\u2019s school, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, at No. 16 this year, up two spots from 2013.British and American universities ceded 3 percent of the ladder this year, though the usual leaders, like Cambridge, Harvard, Oxford and Yale, continued to dominate the list. Though premier schools kept their spots, several medium-size American universities slid the rankings. The University of Southern California lost 17 places, and Purdue University dropped from 96 to 131. However, European institutions with longstanding reputations like the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, in Switzerland, and Bocconi University, in Milan, held steady, even making gains.\u201cHigher education is a global market,\u201d said Laurent Dupasquier, managing partner at Emerging. \u201cThe location is becoming less and less important.\u201d This year, the Emerging-Trendence study added a layer to the survey and turned its focus to recruiters\u2019 vision of the \u201cuniversity of tomorrow.\u201d More than 60 percent of participants believed that universities would create a more global model in the future. Companies needed to be more involved in universities, which could lead to a blending of academics and the demands of the marketplace.About 40 percent of respondents suggested that institutions offer practical workshops with professionals. Other ideas included courses that focused on \u201csoft skills\u201d and programs developed by businesses themselves. Shirley Jackson, a top global recruiter at the consulting firm EY, said these \u201csoft skills\u201d \u2014 essentially personality and social traits \u2014 were key to landing internships and jobs. Ms. Jackson said she also considered candidates\u2019 interests outside of academics \u2014 sports, volunteer work, school organizations \u2014 from which she gleaned their ability to work in a team, lead and adapt socially.Ms. Jackson said EY tracked which employees performed well and made a note of their schools for future recruiting. In Italy, for example, about 40 percent of employees hired by EY had attended Bocconi University, she said.Now back at the Elea Foundation, Ms. M\u00fcller said the diversity of the students she worked with in Hong Kong had broadened her perspective on international business and forced her to rethink how she conducted herself. Ms. M\u00fcller said that the foundation had grown and that with her M.B.A., she now felt more confident in handling new management tasks.Going to school in Hong Kong for 15 months also allowed Ms. M\u00fcller to develop a new network with fellow graduate students and professionals in the region, where she said her company\u2019s business ties were the weakest.\u201cOur generation is very globalized,\u201d she said. \u201cEventually you have to put cultural dos and don\u2019ts aside and function as a team to get the work done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Although overall wages increased 0.4 percent \u2014 double what economists had been expecting \u2014 the gain for lower-paid workers in nonsupervisory and production roles increased only 0.2 percent.Just how much the typical employee\u2019s pay might go up in the months ahead \u2014 and whether most workers will see significant gains or just a select few \u2014 is a key question in the economic debate facing Wall Street, academia, officials in the Obama administration and, especially, the Federal Reserve.On Tuesday and Wednesday, Fed policy makers will hold their final meeting of the year, followed by a news conference from Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, where she is expected to provide further hints about when the Fed will begin raising short-term interest rates after keeping them near zero for the last six years.The nascent uptick in wages has prompted further warnings from the more hawkish members of the Fed\u2019s policy-making council who want the central bank to start tightening monetary policy sooner, rather than later, to ward off what they see as a potential threat of inflation.But Ms. Yellen and a majority of Fed policy makers, pointing to evidence that inflation remains well under the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target, do not appear to be unduly alarmed and probably still prefer to leave interest rates as low as possible until the trend is better established.\u201cUntil it is unambiguous, people can spin it any way they want,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cOne month is a curiosity, two months is interesting and three months is a trend.\u201dThe split at the Fed is echoed in Washington, primarily along partisan lines. On Capitol Hill, some Republicans say it is time for the Fed to act, while Democrats in the Obama administration, like Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, say there is no rush.\u201cI welcome the point when my first concern when I get out of bed in the morning is having to address rapid wage growth,\u201d Mr. Perez said. \u201cI\u2019m not too worried about inflation.\u201dAs for the argument that the Fed needs to move sooner, rather than later, Mr. Perez said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t reject that in stronger terms.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time for the middle class and the aspiring middle class to share in the dividends of their hard work,\u201d he added. \u201cThe folks at the top end have been doing great and our prosperity hasn\u2019t been shared.\u201dBy contrast, Representative Kevin P. Brady, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has called on the Fed to move quickly, but even some conservative economists say the plunge in energy prices gives the central bank more flexibility this time around.\u201cHistorically, inflation is something that gets out of the box because the Fed moves too slowly,\u201d said Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and a former Fed economist. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had a positive energy shock, so the Fed has ample room to wait and see.\u201dIn just the last month, average gasoline prices have dropped by 25 cents, to $2.77 a gallon nationally, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, and more reductions are on the way as crude oil prices continue to fall.And if wages keep rising, the typical American family will have a couple of thousand more dollars to spend in 2015. Extended over the next year, November\u2019s 0.4 percent increase in average hourly earnings would equal an annual wage increase of nearly 5 percent, more than double the 2.1 percent increase recorded over the last 12 months.\u201cIf the average is 2 percent, there are a lot of people getting next to nothing,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. \u201cAnd 2 percent wage growth when corporate profits are skyrocketing makes people very angry.\u201dBut before anyone strikes up \u201cHappy Days Are Here Again,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson cautioned that a previous 0.4 percent rise in wages in June 2013 was followed by no increase the next month. Similarly, the 0.4 percent gain in October 2011 also showed no signs of staying power.What might be different this time, Mr. Shepherdson said, is that the rise in average hourly earnings coincides with other positive data, including a fall in jobless claims, a declining unemployment rate and healthy hiring by private employers, as well as an increase in job openings.On Monday, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production in the United States rose by 1.1 percent in November, and also revised upward the increase for October. Over all, the new data shows factory output in the United States has finally exceeded its prerecession level.Despite the positive data recently, Fed policy makers have made clear that they won\u2019t act on rates this week, or at their next meeting in January, but rather wait at least until March and more likely June 2015, at the earliest, economists said.One possible development on Wednesday, when policy makers wrap up their meeting, is that the Fed will tweak the language in its policy statement and drop its reference to keep rates near zero \u201cfor a considerable time.\u201dAlthough optimists like Mr. Shepherdson and Mr. Behravesh say the wage gains should become broader as unemployment continues to fall, professionals on the front lines of the labor market say higher-paid, better-educated workers with specialized skills are still getting the greater share of raises right now.\u201cWhat people want to see is 1999 or 2004, when companies were saying, \u2018We\u2019ll hire anyone,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s happening now.\u201dInstead, Mr. Gimbel said, salaries are rising in sectors in which experienced workers are harder to find, like technology, finance and higher-level accounting positions, and where salaries tend to be at least $80,000 or more.For recent college graduates with liberal arts degrees, or workers in call centers and in data processing jobs, where yearly wages are less than $50,000, Mr. Gimbel said, \u201cwe\u2019re bringing people in at the same salary as 10 years ago.\u201dMr. Gimbel added that new college graduates were still willing to take jobs they might have rejected in the past, like working in a call center.\u201cThey figure, \u201cThe sooner I get a job, the quicker I can start paying off a mountain of student debt,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for guys working as a lifeguard or in the gym, a call center is white-collar experience.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Camden, Development Projects Kindle Hope", "Date": "2014-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetCAMDEN, N.J. \u2014 In a city with a bleak history of crime and poverty, plans for real estate development suggest there is new hope for an economic revival, thanks in large part to tax credits from a state-run program.In the last six months, six major development projects have been approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority for tax credits worth a total of $614 million, leading to the creation, retention or relocation of some 2,000 jobs in one of the country\u2019s poorest cities.The latest approvals, announced by the agency on Tuesday, are for $117.8 million in tax credits to Subaru of America to establish a new headquarters and training center in Camden, and for $39.9 million to Cooper Health, a health care provider already based in Camden, to consolidate its back-office operations, with the retention of some 350 jobs.In addition, new market-rate apartments are being built or renovated to meet growing demand from an expanding medical community, a supermarket operator has just opened a store, and city government has begun the bond-financed demolition of about 600 abandoned houses in an effort to improve a blighted landscape.\u201cWe\u2019re working to rebuild Camden and restore a sense of hope and pride,\u201d Mayor Dana L. Redd said in an interview. \u201cOur residents are starting to take pride in what they see happening in their city.\u201dMs. Redd, a Camden native now in her second term, said she measured progress in terms of public safety, education and jobs, and predicted that gains on all three fronts, together with the tax incentives provided by the state, will encourage companies to relocate or expand in Camden.Recent additions include the Philadelphia 76ers, the basketball team announced in June that it would move the team headquarters and practice facility from Philadelphia, just across the Delaware River, to a new 120,000-square-foot building in Camden, bringing 250 jobs to the city by June 2016. The move qualified the N.B.A. franchise for $82 million in tax credits, payable over 10 years, under New Jersey\u2019s Economic Opportunity Act of 2013.In July, the state approved $260 million in tax credits for Holtec International, a maker of parts for nuclear power plants, to build a 600,000 square-foot plant in Camden\u2019s port area, with the addition of around 400 jobs.And on Nov. 10, the Economic Development Authority said it would provide $107 million in tax credits for the military contractor Lockheed Martin to move 250 jobs to Camden from its location in Moorestown, N.J.While tax incentives may be the biggest motivator for companies to move to Camden, the relocations would not happen without the city\u2019s approach to fighting crime, creating jobs and driving down poverty, officials said.According to the Census Bureau, 38.6 percent of Camden residents lived below the federal poverty line from 2008 to 2012, more than twice the national average. This February, the city was named the most dangerous city of its size in America, according to a national ranking based on F.B.I. data.But crime in the city of about 77,000 residents has fallen since Camden County took over the city\u2019s police force in early 2013, putting more officers on the streets. The number of homicides dropped to 28 in 2014 so far from a peak of 58 in all of 2012, while all violent crime was 70 percent lower this summer than last, Ms. Redd said.Meanwhile, the official unemployment rate has dropped to 16 percent from 19 percent in 2010, Ms. Redd said, compared with the current national rate of 5.8 percent.Although a lower crime rate may encourage companies to add workers in Camden, it is less clear whether the new employees will also live there, said Michael Silverman, managing director in the Philadelphia office of Integra Realty Resources, a real estate valuation firm. Without new residents, the city will struggle to recover, he said.\u201cPeople will go there to work but you still need people to live there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recovery is still a long ways off.\u201dBut in a sign of growing demand for unsubsidized housing, a downtown development of one- and two-bedroom apartments is set to become the city\u2019s first new development in more than 10 years to be rented at market rates.The Cooper Village development of 59 new and renovated units, scheduled for completion in June, is expected to be occupied largely by students and nurses from the adjacent Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, said Jason E. Friedland, a partner with Iron Stone Strategic Capital Partners, a Philadelphia company that is developing the complex.Mr. Friedland said the development qualified for tax credits equaling 40 percent of its $18 million cost, payable by the state at 10 percent a year for 10 years. The credit was the biggest incentive for Iron Stone to take on the project, he said, although the company was also motivated by additional historic tax credits for renovating the 100-year-old buildings.The credits helped the company to overcome doubts about Camden that have deterred many other investors over the years, Mr. Friedland said. \u201cThey would say, \u2018I\u2019m not taking that risk \u2014 it\u2019s Camden,\u2019\u201d he said.But the prospect of market-rate rentals suggests that the Camden market may finally be gathering enough strength to exist without government support, Mr. Friedland said.Robert Corrales, a spokesman for Mayor Redd, confirmed that Cooper Village would be the first new market-rate development in Camden since the city\u2019s RCA Victor building, a former gramophone factory on the Delaware River waterfront, was converted into apartments by the developer Carl Dranoff in 2003.If there is good demand for the Cooper Village apartments, Mr. Silverman said, they could be a \u201cgame changer.\"Returning confidence in Camden also helped reopen a supermarket, after a year in which the city became a food \u201cdesert\u201d where residents had to buy groceries from expensive corner stores, or travel to supermarkets in neighboring towns.Jason Ravitz, a partner in Ravitz Family Markets, said the company opened the Price Rite market on the city\u2019s south side on Oct. 15 on the former site of a supermarket whose closure left the city with no grocery store.Mr. Ravitz said his family recognized the challenges of running a business in Camden but opened the new market because there was clear demand for it.\u201cWe believe that it is, and will continue to be, an underserved area,\u201d he said. The store, which includes foods selected for Camden\u2019s Hispanic and Caribbean populations, has experienced \u201cexcellent\u201d demand since it opened, he said.In another development meant to improve the urban landscape, the former site of a parking garage on the west side of Camden\u2019s City Hall has been converted into a park, offering residents green lawns, blue lounge chairs and an open-air piano that is available for public use.Kobie H. Mack Sr., playing the piano with a friend, said the park helped to restore civic pride in Camden after years of damage from crime, drugs and poverty.\u201cTo see this park utilized by the people, that is a great step for Camden,\u201d he said. \u201cThis without question is spiritually lifting.\u201dMr. Mack said the site was once marked with crosses to commemorate people who had died from violence or drugs \u2014 whose effect on the city is still shown by a methadone clinic across the street from the park.With more police on the streets, and an improving economy, Mr. Mack said he was feeling better all the time about living in Camden. \u201cThis stuff is turning around,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Final Spending Bill, Salty Food and Belching Cows Are Winners", "Date": "2014-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Health insurance companies preserved their tax breaks. Farmers and ranchers were spared having to report on pollution from manure. Tourist destinations like Las Vegas benefited from a travel promotion program.Also buried in the giant spending bill that cleared the Senate on Saturday and is headed to President Obama for his signature were provisions that prohibit the federal government from requiring less salt in school lunches and allow schools to obtain exemptions from whole-grain requirements for pasta and tortillas.The watered-down standards for school meals were a setback for the first lady, Michelle Obama, who had vowed to fight \u201cuntil the bitter end\u201d for tougher nutrition standards. But they were a victory for food companies and some local school officials, who had sought changes in regulations that are taking effect over several years.When an omnibus spending bill pops onto the floor of the House or the Senate in the waning days of a congressional session, some lawmakers invariably express surprise and outrage at special-interest provisions stuffed into the package. Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio and a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, criticized the $1.1 trillion spending measure as \u201ca Christmas tree bill,\u201d decorated with \u201cdangerous and unwelcome, nongermane riders.\u201dSuch favors often have a long lineage. Lobbyists and lawmakers have, in many cases, been working on them for months or years. Some of this year\u2019s provisions originated as free-standing bills, languished on their own and were then revived in the spending package. Others block regulations that have been proposed, adopted and sometimes upheld in court.The School Nutrition Association, representing cafeteria directors, welcomed the bill\u2019s language on sodium and whole grains. The lower sodium standards would have been \u201cextremely difficult to achieve,\u201d and the government needs more research before compelling schools to make such costly changes, said the association, which receives financial support from food companies. Republicans like Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky, the committee chairman, said the riders were needed to halt wasteful spending and \u201coverreach\u201d by agencies that generate rules harmful to the economy.A typically arcane provision of the bill provides relief to nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which have special tax breaks that were threatened by the Affordable Care Act. Blue Cross is not mentioned by name in the relevant section of the 2015 spending bill, titled \u201cModification of treatment of certain health organizations.\u201d But the deduction in question is available only to Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which have been lobbying Congress for a clarification since the Affordable Care Act was signed in 2010. The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association scored several victories that require the government to keep its regulatory hands off farms and ranches. The bill says the government cannot require farmers to report \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions from manure management systems.\u201d Nor can it require ranchers to obtain greenhouse gas permits for \u201cmethane emissions\u201d produced by bovine flatulence or belching. The Environmental Protection Agency says on its website that \u201cglobally, the agriculture sector is the primary source\u201d of methane emissions.The spending bill requires the E.P.A. to withdraw a new rule defining how the Clean Water Act applies to certain agricultural conservation practices. It also prevents the Army Corps of Engineers from regulating farm ponds and irrigation ditches under the Clean Water Act.\u201cThis is a major victory for farmers and ranchers, who consistently tell many of us that they are concerned about the potential of the E.P.A. and the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 overreach into their operations,\u201d Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho, said.The bill renews a travel promotion program championed by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and by Las Vegas casinos. \u201cFrom the Las Vegas Strip to our pristine natural treasures like Lake Tahoe, tourists from all over the world want to visit Nevada,\u201d Mr. Reid said, and the legislation encourages them to do so.But Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, blasted this as \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201d \u201cLast I checked,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, \u201ccasinos were very profitable endeavors that didn\u2019t need the taxpayers helping them out.\u201dThe bill provides more than $550 billion for national defense, including money for warplanes, missiles and submarines. But mundane military matters also drew attention. The bill is accompanied by a \u201cjoint explanatory statement\u201d that gives thousands of directives to federal agencies. One directive deals literally with boots on the ground. It orders the Defense Logistics Agency to re-examine the way it defines \u201csmall business\u201d when buying boots and other military footwear. A supplier can qualify for advantages as a small business if it has no more than 1,000 employees. The number doubled in 2012.Lawmakers fear that the new size standards could harm \u201ctrue small businesses\u201d and \u201cthe domestic supply base for military footwear.\u201d Michigan\u2019s congressional delegation sought the legislative directive in response to concerns expressed by a Michigan company, Bates Footwear, which supplies combat boots and dress shoes to the military.Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonprofit research group that tracks federal spending, said the bill bestowed favors on all sorts of constituencies.\u201cAuthors of the bill and lobbyists behind these provisions know they are in there,\u201d Mr. Ellis said. \u201cBut the public will not find out about most of them for weeks or months, if ever.\u201d Congress supposedly forswore spending earmarks several years ago, after federal largess led to several scandals. But lawmakers can still steer money in less conspicuous ways.For example, the 2015 spending bill authorizes additional money for an unnamed \u201cheritage area\u201d specified in Section 157 of title I of Public Law 106-291. That section of the law, enacted 14 years ago, established a national heritage area in Wheeling, W.Va., to celebrate the area\u2019s role in American history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Strategy for Pensions at Risk of Extinction", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceWhen people are old, should governments guarantee they have incomes?In the 19th century \u2014 125 years ago \u2014 Germany became the first country to answer yes to that question, adopting an old-age pension system at the behest of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.That concept spread to the United States in the 20th century. Eighty years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed a Committee on Economic Security, whose proposals led, a year later, to establishment of the Social Security system.Forty years ago, President Gerald Ford signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which enshrined the concept that pension promises were sacred. Companies could change, or even eliminate, pension plans, but workers were entitled to the benefits they had already earned. A government agency was set up to guarantee that pensions would be paid even if the sponsoring company went broke.This year may well be remembered as the one when the fundamental tenet of Erisa, as the law came to be known, was abandoned.The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the agency set up 40 years ago to guarantee those pensions, made clear in its annual report released last month that one group of pension funds would most likely run out of money within a few years. Absent new legislation, the already modest pensions of some retired workers will be eliminated.The endangered pensions are not in the P.B.G.C.\u2019s largest program, which insures pensions backed by a single company. That program is said to have a multibillion-dollar deficit, but there is no immediate danger for pension recipients. The problem is in the area known as multiemployer pension plans. Those plans, often involving unionized workers, were once common in industries like coal mining, trucking and construction. Workers could accrue benefits while moving from employer to employer, with each employer contributing to the plan.Those plans seemed so solid in 1974 that they were not even required to be covered under Erisa. When they were added, years later, they were put into their own separate insurance scheme.Now that scheme is in danger of failing. The P.B.G.C. this year added two huge multiemployer plans to the list of those it expects to fail within 10 years. It did not identify the plans, but it appears they were those sponsored by the United Mine Workers and the Central States Teamsters unions.When those funds run out of money to pay benefits, it will be up to the P.B.G.C. to step in. It now pays a maximum of $12,870 a year for workers who spent 30 years digging coal or driving trucks, even if the plan called for larger payouts. A worker with only 15 years of service gets half of that. But the P.B.G.C. says its multiemployer plan might run out of money in 2018 and is virtually certain to fail by 2025. \u201cWhen the program becomes insolvent,\u201d wrote Alice C. Maroni, the agency\u2019s acting director, in the new annual report, the \u201cP.B.G.C. will be unable to provide financial assistance to pay guaranteed benefits for insolvent plans.\u201d That meager pension check will fall to zero.\u201cThese are generally low-paid people who worked really hard and do not deserve to be left with nothing other than Social Security,\u201d said Alicia Munnell, an economist who is the director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.In another era, a consensus would have been reached that something should be done to prevent that from happening. It was, after all, not the workers\u2019 fault that the economy changed in ways that left unionized companies struggling to compete, or that some companies in such plans went broke, leaving the remaining ones to pick up bigger shares of the burden. It is not their fault that some plans now have four or five retirees for every active worker.There are those who are outraged by the proposal. AARP, the lobbyist for retired people, protested that \u201cthe anti-cutback rule,\u201d barring the reduction of benefits already earned and vested, \u201cis perhaps the most fundamental of Erisa\u2019s participant protections.\u201d But in the current century, spending taxpayer money to help the unfortunate is unpopular.It may not help that the multiemployer plans generally benefit union members, a group whose political influence is waning. Nor does it help that the Central States Teamsters fund was legendarily corrupt a few generations ago, although that fact does not seem to be a cause of its current problems. Erisa never covered public pensions, and there are plenty of troubles in that area now. While few companies still offer defined-benefit pensions, many local and state governments still do. But Detroit was able to reduce its obligations in bankruptcy, and some states are seeking ways to get around legal protections for pension benefits.The baby boomers now retiring \u2014 a group that includes me \u2014 may be the last American generation to leave work assured of adequate income in old age. In place of defined-benefit pensions, future generations will be left with their own savings.Employers, private or public, are no longer willing to accept the investment risks that come from managing plans that promise benefits, so that risk has been transferred to workers. Whatever one thinks of 401(k) defined-contribution plans, they offer no guarantees and no assurances that even retirees who build up substantial balances will not outlive their money.And the evidence is that most people are not saving much money. In \u201cFalling Short, the Coming Retirement Crisis and What to Do About It,\u201d a book to be published next week by Oxford University Press, Ms. Munnell and two co-authors, Charles D. Ellis and Andrew D. Eschtruth, argue that retirees need more money than ever before, with health care costs rising and life expectancies growing at the same time that low interest rates mean savings earn little income.They say the typical household nearing retirement has only $110,000 in a 401(k), an amount that will not go far.They want to raise payroll taxes to shore up Social Security and to make it automatic for workers to join 401(k) plans. Employees could still opt out, but research shows inertia leads people to stay in if they are in and to stay out if they are out. They think we should work longer and save more.All that makes sense. But it is a far cry from the spirit that defined the progress toward income security of the previous two centuries. Then there was a willingness to believe that those who had failed to navigate the road to comfortable retirements deserved at least some minimal level of public support. Now, with retired coal miners in danger of losing meager pensions, the political system seems unwilling to even consider a taxpayer-supported solution. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Says It Will Ban Uber\u2019s Low-Cost Service in New Year", "Date": "2014-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The problems facing Uber, the popular ride-booking service, are going from bad to worse.On Monday, the French government announced that the company\u2019s lower-priced UberPop service would be banned on Jan. 1, the latest in a number of setbacks for Uber, which is facing bans in several cities worldwide.France\u2019s announcement has again put the spotlight on Uber, an American company that has been attracting criticism across the globe that it does not comply with local licensing laws. It also follows steps by policy makers in Amsterdam, Delhi and elsewhere to ban its services.Uber says that it will challenge any legal ruling \u2014including the potential ban across France \u2014 that would block it.In the latest legal twist for Uber, Pierre-Henry Brandet, the French Interior Ministry spokesman, said Monday that new legislation called the Th\u00e9venoud Law \u2014 which requires all drivers who chauffeur paying passengers to have a license and appropriate insurance \u2014 would form the basis of the ban. UberPop does not meet the licensing requirement.The low-cost service is used by roughly 40 percent, or 200,000 people, of Uber\u2019s customers in France, and its fares can run more than a third below standard taxi rates. UberPop is similar to UberX in the United States, with neither service requiring drivers to have the licenses required of traditional taxi driver. Any approved driver with a car and a proprietary Uber device can pick up passengers.\u201cCurrently, those who use UberPop are not protected in case of an accident,\u201d Mr. Brandet told the French news channel BFM TV, on Monday. \u201cSo not only is it illegal to offer the service, but for the consumer, it\u2019s a real danger.\u201dCustomers who call up Uber through its smartphone application find various levels of rides, from budget commuter cars to premium black sedans. The company says that its low-cost service has proved popular throughout Europe, and that existing taxi associations are fighting to outlaw it because they do not want the competition in an industry whose rules have not changed for decades.\u201cConsumers are adopting UberPop very quickly,\u201d said Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, Uber\u2019s regional general manager for Western Europe, adding that in cities like Brussels, the low-cost service is the only product that the company offers. \u201cTraditional taxi drivers have always had a lot of power. Every time governments have tried to modernize the industry, it has proved problematic.\u201dUber\u2019s other ride-booking services, including those involving traditional taxis and luxury sedans that require chauffeur licenses, charge more than UberPop. Rivals, including Lyft, which is available only in the United States, also offer low-cost ride-booking services, though global regulatory attention has so far focused on Uber.While a Paris judge ruled last week that UberPop could continue operating, Mr. Brandet, the Interior Ministry spokesman, noted that a French criminal court in October had fined the company $124,000 for deceptive marketing, saying that Uber was operating a taxi service, rather than a ride-sharing program. Uber is allowed to continue operating as it appeals that decision.The October decision \u201cis exactly in line\u201d with the government\u2019s thinking, Mr. Brandet said, which calls for \u201cbetter regulating the profession to avoid unfair competition.\u201d Those who operate such services, he said, could face two years in prison and fines of up to $370,000.To adapt to the challenge posed by Uber and similar services, the French government passed the Th\u00e9venoud Law. It would require that all drivers who chauffeur paying passengers have a license and appropriate insurance. Drivers for services like UberPop would also have to have 250 hours of professional training, though that is still less than what most taxi drivers, who are considered to be professionals, must have.Rom\u00e9o Pestana, president of the French Taxi Association, said it was not clear whether the law could be used successfully to outlaw Uber because it left room for the service to claim that its rights of entrepreneurship were being harmed.And with just two weeks left in the year, crucial elements of the law remain to be settled. That fact figured in the legal decision on Friday, in which the Paris court, though partly siding with Uber\u2019s opponents, said it could not apply legal remedies against Uber. It also said any challenges should be heard by a criminal court.Uber has sought to play down safety concerns about its low-cost service. On its French driver recruiting website, it assures applicants that they do not need any insurance beyond what is standard for their vehicles. All UberPop trips are covered by commercial liability insurance with a $5 million per accident maximum, it says, which covers any damage or injuries caused by the driver.\u201cOf course, we take seriously any comments from French officials,\u201d said Mr. Gore-Coty of Uber, who added that UberPop would still be available in France after Jan. 1. \u201cBut this law is extremely fragile. It\u2019s being challenged all over the place.\u201dAnd while some in France have called for the outright banning of Uber\u2019s services, other lawmakers have thrown their support behind the company and the wider so-called sharing economy, which allows people to rent out spare rooms or earn extra cash by chauffeuring others around town.Talking at a technology conference in Paris last week, Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, sided with Uber, saying that the company should not be banned in Paris.\u201cYou have to be disruptive,\u201d he added.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of a contributor.

That, more or less, happens each year at Art Basel in Miami Beach, and the results have been impressive.The fair provides a healthy injection of cash to the local economy ahead of the vacation season that starts after Christmas. It\u2019s unclear how many of the 75,000 Art Basel visitors come from outside the area, but the Greater Miami Convention & Visitors Bureau calculates that hotel occupancy rises by 30,000 on the days the fair is in progress, enough to take it from the 75 percent level typical for early December to nearly 100 percent throughout Dade County, the wider jurisdiction that Miami dominates.Based on estimates of average expenditure for rooms, meals and other elements of a fun holiday, plus the higher prices that hotels can command when demand is strong, the fair brings close to $13 million a year to the region, assuming that those who attend are just like ordinary tourists. But they are not.Local officials are fond of saying that more private jets are used to bring visitors to Art Basel than to the Super Bowl, the gaudy, glitzy championship of American football. Any crude spending figure tied directly to the fair has to be bumped up to account for the higher-end products and services that well-off visitors consume, along with purchases of artworks, some of which fetch millions of dollars.\u201cIt\u2019s priceless business for us,\u201d said William D. Talbert III, chief executive of the Convention & Visitors Bureau. \u201cBefore Art Basel, you never had art, business and billionaires in the same sentence\u201d spoken about Miami.Fredric Snitzer, who came to Miami and opened his Fredric Snitzer Gallery in 1977, agreed that \u201cthe impact that Art Basel has had over the years has been significant financially; it has impacted the community in every possible way.\u201dAs big a boost as the influx of wealthy people provides to South Florida during the five days of the annual fair, the intangible impact has been far more substantial and persistent, civic officials and others say. The influence extends beyond the convention center that houses the event and lingers for the other 360 days of the year.\u201cIt\u2019s about the brand, the impact of this show,\u201d Mr. Talbert said. \u201cArt Basel Miami Beach is a singular event that points out that Miami is a world-class community, a destination for art collectors and for buying and selling art. Before Art Basel, we weren\u2019t on that radar screen at all.\u201d But now that collectors have a fix on Miami, they and other culture aficionados are coming throughout the year, and for some of them, it\u2019s a one-way trip.\u201cWhat Art Basel has done for Miami is to attract two different kinds of customer: the high-end customer who likes very expensive art and what we call the \u2018creative class,\u2019 mostly younger people who like to live in and visit cities that have everything,\u201d said Arun Sharma, a professor of marketing at the University of Miami. \u201cThe others come and go. The members of the creative class are the ones that come and stay.\u201dThe Midtown neighborhood, an enclave of restaurants, galleries and high-end shops, is a focal point for this creative class. It had been a rundown area, Mr. Sharma noted, and that made rents low enough for entrepreneurs, eager to capture the city\u2019s evolving zeitgeist. Once they did, Midtown became a magnet for locals of a hip, cultural bent and eventually for similar people from outside South Florida. \u201cHigh-end art buyers come and buy art and leave, but they leave behind the environment for culture to flourish,\u201d Mr. Sharma said. \u201cCould it have been independently created without Art Basel? I\u2019m not sure, but it was created by Art Basel.\u201d Rich collectors may leave, but some have a home to go to when they are back in town. A concrete \u2014 literally, in some cases \u2014 economic benefit of Art Basel and Miami\u2019s cultural development is a boom in high-end real estate. \u201cCondo construction has been just extraordinary,\u201d Mr. Talbert said. \u201cLuxury condo developers have booths and sales efforts near the show. When folks are here, they buy luxury condominiums as a second, third or fourth home. They see Miami as a destination that\u2019s both tropical and cosmopolitan.\u201dJessica Katz, head of the Miami office of the auction house Christie\u2019s, identified a virtuous circle. The city\u2019s growing sophistication fostered the development of areas like Midtown, the adjacent Design District and Wynwood District; their presence is attracting new visitors, and this group is leading to further artistic endeavors.\u201cDemographics and behavior have shifted,\u201d she said. \u201cMiami used to be more of a beach destination, but it has become such a year-round cultural destination with world-class museums. People would come for a week and then leave. Now they can make a longer trip out of it.\u201dAs for Art Basel\u2019s role in this, Ms. Katz said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the chicken or the egg, but the fair has been a catalyst for that growth. Miami has always had art galleries, but a lot of them represented primarily local artists. Now there are top-tier galleries opening offices and spaces here and transacting in blue-chip art based here in Miami.\u201dBut some Miami artists complain that they have largely been passed by as the influence of Art Basel has expanded. Mr. Snitzer acknowledged that while the impact of the fair has been substantially positive, collectors\u2019 anticipation of it has created several months of listlessness in the market each year.\u201cArt Basel gave us huge international exposure, but now we have to compete with 240 of the best galleries in the world four days a year,\u201d he said. The attitude of collectors seems to be, \u201c\u2018If we\u2019re coming to Miami any time from August on, why not wait until Art Basel?\u201d\u2019 he said.Obviously there was art in Miami before Art Basel, and there was enough of it \u2014 and enough high-end collectors \u2014 to persuade the Swiss organization to choose Miami Beach when it decided to add a winter fair. \u201cPart of the genius of Art Basel is that they realized that Miami was in resurgence before anyone else did,\u201d said Michael Spring, director of the Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs. \u201cThe Swiss realized there was a dynamic cultural and arts scene that they could hitch their wagon to.\u201dThe wagon has grown substantially since then. Arts organizations in the region employ 30,000 people and generate $1.1 billion in annual revenue, he said.Part of Mr. Spring\u2019s job is to cultivate an appreciation for the arts among home-grown Floridians, especially young ones, not just transplants and tourists. The Dade County Cultural Passport program requires children in all grades to engage in cultural activity (they get a passport stamp for each one), and Culture Shock Miami provides high school and college students access to $5 tickets for arts events.\u201cArt Basel helped convey that there\u2019s a cultural depth to Miami,\u201d he said. \u201cAs all of this flash and glamour is occurring, we\u2019re building a foundation underneath it to sustain it for generations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Kansas Town Rallies for a Modest Lifeline: A Local Grocery Store", "Date": "2014-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPLAINS, Kan. \u2014 Here in southwest Kansas, where small communities have struggled since the Dust Bowl to retain businesses and residents, a town\u2019s viability is measured by what has not yet closed. Losing a post office is considered the kiss of death. Losing a school can be a terminal diagnosis.But losing a grocery store, as Plains did in 2001, is a problem that, while not necessarily lethal, is most certainly cause for concern.\u201cA grocery store is the heart of the town,\u201d said Jeanne Roberts, who is leading the effort to open a new shop. \u201cIn small towns, it\u2019s the social gathering place. And when you don\u2019t have that social gathering place and you\u2019re going outside, then you don\u2019t feel connected.\u201dMany people in Plains are fighting \u2014 against the odds, but with some notable success \u2014 to bring fresh groceries back to their one-square-mile city limits.Supporters of the project believe a grocery store will serve as a catalyst for further development and an antidote to the demographic trends that have ravaged this part of the nation for decades.As is typical for the region, this county\u2019s population has fallen by roughly a third, to about 4,500, since peaking in the 1930 census.No one here seems to be rooting against the grocery store, but some wonder how successful it would be. After all, Plains once had two places to buy food, and both went out of business.\u201cI just hope that if it does come, it\u2019s supported,\u201d said June Bender, the city clerk, who said she drives about 25 miles each way to much larger Liberal, Kan., and buys her food there. Ms. Bender rarely shopped in Plains when it had a grocery store, though she said \u201cthere\u2019s good things\u201d about having such a retailer in town.Unlike some rural communities, Plains is not on the brink of death. It has about 1,150 residents, a figure that has stayed mostly steady for decades. There is a newly remodeled library, a busy post office and a high school a few miles outside of town.Residents gather for coffee in the morning at Daylight Donuts, plan their evenings around youth choir concerts and speak highly of the Saturday night sirloin specials at the Plains Tavern.\u201cPlains is definitely a typical small town, with a small-town atmosphere,\u201d said Elton Argo, the school district superintendent. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe, very comfortable community.\u201dBut there are also empty storefronts, residential streets with overgrown sidewalks, and many people who grew up here now raising their own families elsewhere. All that has some worried that Plains is at a tipping point: It can either thrive in its own right or fade into a bedroom community whose residents drive somewhere else to work, eat and shop.Plains, like so many Midwestern towns, came of age in the early 20th century as America expanded westward and turned virgin prairie into endless farmland.Plains\u2019s economy remains largely agricultural, but unlike a century ago, residents now must look beyond downtown to buy the essentials. Shoppers can purchase some food at a gas station in town, but a full selection of groceries requires a 14-mile drive to Meade, the county seat, or a longer one to Liberal, an economic center with about 20,000 residents, several meatpacking plants and large chain stores and restaurants.Donald D. Stull, a professor of sociocultural anthropology at the University of Kansas who has studied the state\u2019s communities, said it was not clear how many residents would choose to shop in Plains if given the choice, pointing to what he called the \u201cWalmart effect.\u201d\u201cPeople will drive 25 miles or 30 miles, where the local grocery is not going to be able to compete in terms of price or in terms of selection,\u201d Professor Stull said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re battling against. I\u2019m not saying people won\u2019t do it, but it\u2019s an uphill battle.\u201dMs. Roberts has been trying for six years to bring a grocery store back to Plains, and she believes there is renewed enthusiasm for shopping locally. With the help of other residents, she has formed a nonprofit foundation and lined up about $400,000 through tax credits, grants, donations and fund-raisers. With about $5,100 more, they will have enough money to finish buying the empty land on Grand Avenue where, one day soon, they hope to build.\u201cThey don\u2019t have a paid city manager, they don\u2019t have a paid chamber of commerce,\u201d Ms. Penner said, describing many small Kansas communities. \u201cNo one is paid to figure out how to sustain the town. Volunteers are left to figure out how to sustain the town.\u201dPlains is about one-third of the way to its fund-raising goal. Kanstarter has backers in state government who believe fully funded projects could lead to further development in rural communities. Earlier this year, the Kansas Department of Commerce awarded Ms. Penner\u2019s foundation $200,000 in tax credits to help start and maintain the website.But even if donors raise enough money to buy the property in Plains, organizers will still need roughly $1 million more to build, equip, stock and staff a store. It is a lofty goal, a fact acknowledged even by the project\u2019s most optimistic supporters.The grocery store\u2019s boosters say they labor on because Plains\u2019s limited shopping options affect more than just pantries.Mr. Argo, the superintendent, said some candidates for teaching jobs have been scared off in part because of the lack of nearby food. And Faye Coats, a retired farmworker who has lived in the town since the 1940s, said she thought downtown grocery shopping would be a boon to Plains, even though some of the women she played cards with were skeptical.For Ms. Coats, traveling to another town to buy food might not be an option for much longer. \u201cI\u2019m going to be too old to drive pretty soon,\u201d she said.Susan Beachy contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Calls on Cuba to Free American Held Since 2009 as Spy", "Date": "2014-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 After five years of behind-the-scenes talks, entreaties from high-profile emissaries and statements from two governments, each blaming the other for intransigence, it still comes down to this: Alan P. Gross, an American government contractor, remains imprisoned in Cuba on espionage charges.As relatives and supporters described Mr. Gross, 65, as being in declining health and growing suicidal over the lack of progress in his case, the White House on Wednesday marked the fifth year of his detention with a statement making clear that \u201cthe Cuban government\u2019s release of Alan on humanitarian grounds would remove an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba.\u201dMr. Gross was detained Dec. 3, 2009, for sneaking in communications equipment that would allow unfettered Internet access, as part of a United States Agency for International Development program aimed at fostering democracy.Cuba labeled him a spy and sentenced him to 15 years in prison on charges of participating in a subversive plot to \u201cdestroy the revolution.\u201dThe Castro government has repeatedly linked his case to five Cubans serving long prison sentences in the United States on espionage convictions (two of them have been released after serving their terms). But the American government has said Mr. Gross was not a spy and has rejected, so far, a prisoner swap.Mr. Gross\u2019s advocates had hoped he would be released as his health deteriorated and as President Obama has expressed interest in improving relations with Cuba; in 2009 he took steps that allowed for more cultural and educational exchanges.Mr. Gross\u2019s wife, Judy, said on Wednesday that he had lost more than 100 pounds, could barely walk because of chronic hip pain, and had lost five teeth as well as much of the sight in his right eye.\u201cAfter five years of literally wasting away, Alan is done,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIt is time for President Obama to bring Alan back to the United States now; otherwise it will be too late.\u201dMr. Gross has told recent visitors that he was planning a hunger strike soon and that he would not celebrate his birthday next year in Cuba, meaning he would either be home or would take his own life.Any harm Mr. Gross suffers would only frustrate whatever opportunities might be emerging for a change in relations between the two countries, analysts said.With Mr. Obama showing a determination to use his executive powers to get his way on public policy, many Cuba analysts and lobbyists for more open relations have anticipated new, far-reaching regulatory announcements that would allow Americans to more easily visit the island and support growing private business there.Only Congress can lift the 54-year-old trade embargo, and there is no political momentum there for change, but Mr. Obama has leeway to allow freer travel to the island and to ease the process of going there, as well as to improve diplomatic relations. Outsiders who have discussed Cuba with White House officials said the administration was reviewing its options, but White House officials declined to comment.Panama, which will host the Summit of the Americas in April, has invited Cuba to the meeting, leading many Cuba watchers to expect the administration to make some moves before then, as many countries consider American policy toward Cuba a Cold War relic.But the Gross case has been a sticking point.\u201cWe are optimistic that the president will attend, and I don\u2019t think he wants to go with the same Cuba policy he has now,\u201d said James Williams, a political consultant with the Trimpa Group, which is advising anti-embargo organizations on political strategy.\u201cThe stars are aligned in a way that they never have been before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an impetus as he enters the last two years of his presidency without any elections coming up and with the Summit of the Americas approaching.\u201dOthers wonder if Cuba really wants better relations or more American visitors, if the result could be a threat to the tight control that the government maintains across society. But its ailing economy \u2014 and the fact that its chief benefactor, Venezuela, is in political and economic distress \u2014 may provide motivation for a thaw in relations with the United States.\u201cCuba does not make it easy,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a Cuba scholar at the Americas Society, which has sent the administration a legal analysis on how it could loosen restrictions on Cuba trade. But, he added, \u201cas politically painful and as much a humanitarian issue as the Alan Gross case is, we are allowing a policy that failed to be held hostage by a government that won\u2019t change.\u201dThe refusal to exchange the Cuban spies for Mr. Gross \u201cis historically nonsensical given that the secret diplomacy is littered with prisoner exchanges that had no equivalency between the people traded,\u201d he said.The Cuban government did not comment on Wednesday.Victoria Burnett contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Democrat to Watch in 2015", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 With the New Year comes a new slate of officeholders whose careers warrant close attention and whose fates could have broader political implications. Put Gina Raimondo near the top of that list.She\u2019s the first woman to be elected governor of Rhode Island, and when she\u2019s inaugurated next week, she\u2019ll become, at 43, one of just two Democratic women, alongside Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, at the helms of their states.But it\u2019s another prominent female Democrat from New England who provides a more interesting point of reference for Raimondo. I mean Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts. As much as Warren has excited the left wing of her party, Raimondo has enraged them.She just wrapped up four years as her state\u2019s treasurer, during which she successfully pushed an unusually ambitious overhaul of the pension system for state employees. It suspended cost-of-living adjustments, raised the retirement age by five years and left unions boiling mad. They opposed her in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. She marched to the governor\u2019s job in tension, not harmony, with a key element of the party\u2019s base.Some in the party cast her as a pawn of the finance industry and big corporations, partly because she once worked in venture capital. She started Rhode Island\u2019s first venture capital firm.She doesn\u2019t talk about plutocrats with Warren\u2019s angry fire, not because she thinks they\u2019re above reproach but because she deems vilifying them less fruitful than reminding them that they, too, have a profound stake in a healthier America with a fairer distribution of wealth and more social mobility.\u201cI fall into the camp that income inequality is the biggest problem we face,\u201d she said Monday night over eggplant parmigiana in a Providence restaurant. An Italian-American, she grew up just outside the city and lives here now with her husband and their two young children.She said that she has told Wall Street titans point blank that they should be paying higher federal taxes and leveling the playing field, but with this message: \u201cI need you to double down on America. We need you. We need your brains, we need your money, we need your engagement \u2014 not because it\u2019s Wall Street versus Main Street, but because you\u2019re some of the smartest, richest people in the world, and you need to be a part of fixing America, because you want to live in an America that\u2019s the best country in the world.\u201dShe said that Democrats must always prioritize the underdogs, the strivers. And she spoke admiringly of Warren: \u201cShe says things that make people uncomfortable but need to be said.\u201dBut, she added, \u201cMy own rhetoric is not so \u2018us versus them.\u2019 I don\u2019t like fighting.\u201dAnd she has highlighted additional concerns, such as the Democratic Party\u2019s frequent fealty to organized labor and its reluctance at times to shake up the status quo in order to find the money needed for social spending.Her pension-reform campaign was fascinating for its blunt talk of trade-offs, of sacrifices today for investments in tomorrow. She framed the cutbacks as progressive \u2014 as the only responsible liberalism \u2014 because without them, education, infrastructure, transportation and more would suffer.She sometimes speaks a language of metrics that makes her as stirring to some business-minded centrists as Warren is to many liberals. And if she manages to improve Rhode Island\u2019s famously beleaguered economy, she\u2019s teed up to be a national player, thanks to her youth and back story: a working-class upbringing followed by Harvard, then a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, then Yale Law.She\u2019s small \u2014 just under 5-foot-3 \u2014 and intense. When she mentions that she played rugby in school, it fits. When she describes her advantage on the field, it sounds as if she\u2019s talking about more than sport. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be little and fast,\u201d she said.In focus groups, some Rhode Islanders called her \u201ctoo harsh,\u201d she said, a judgment seemingly connected to her wardrobe of suits. \u201cThen you show them pictures of me in casual clothes and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, she seems nice.\u2019 It\u2019s, like, if you\u2019re a strong woman, you can\u2019t also be nice. It\u2019s really that simple.\u201dWill she be a strong governor? She starts out dogged by a sweeping court challenge to those pension reforms.But this much is clear: She takes risks, colors outside the lines and seeks a tone all her own. That\u2019s worthy of note.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Interest Rate Raised to 17% in Russia", "Date": "2014-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia has a new enemy: the currency markets. Russia\u2019s government is in the middle of an all-out fight to preserve the value of the ruble in the face of plummeting oil prices and Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. In the boldest move yet to stanch the bleeding, the Central Bank of Russia announced a stunning interest rate increase in the middle of the night. Its main deposit rate is now 17 percent, up from 10.5 percent when Russian banks closed for business on Monday. The rate increase, one of the largest ever announced by the central bank, echoes the drastic measures taken during the 1998 crisis when Russia defaulted on its debt and devalued the ruble. The question is whether the move \u2014 announced on the central bank\u2019s website at 1 a.m. in Russia \u2014 will appease the markets. If it doesn\u2019t, investors may view the rate increase as a sign of increasing disarray.Some economists are concerned that Russia is now stuck in the quagmire of stagflation, or high inflation and low growth. The government expects inflation of 10 percent or more by the end of this year and for the country to fall into a recession next year.In a worrying sign, Russians have been buying up big-ticket items as the ruble depreciates, converting savings into consumer goods lest their savings become worthless. Appliance stores in Moscow have seen runs on refrigerators, washing machines and televisions.The strategy behind the rate increase is straightforward. The central bank, led by Elvira Nabiullina, is hoping that the large rate increase will encourage Russian individuals, companies and banks to hold savings in rubles, rather than moving them into dollars. It is also aimed at helping to help keep inflation in check. \u201cThis decision is aimed at limiting substantially increased ruble depreciation risks and inflation risk,\u201d the central bank said in its statement.But the surprise rate increase also underscores the limited options for Russian policy makers. The central bank has spent at least $75 billion this year to prop up the ruble, with little effect. The ruble plummeted yet again on Monday, by more than 10 percent, to about 64 per dollar. The ruble has lost nearly half its value since the start of 2014.Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former Russian finance minister who is widely credited with having steered Russia through the 2008 financial crisis by persuading President Vladimir V. Putin to strengthen sovereign reserves, said that uneven policy making was adding to the erosion of confidence. \u201cThe fall of the ruble and the stock market is not only a reaction to lower oil prices and sanctions, but also distrust in the government\u2019s economic measures,\u201d Mr. Kudrin posted on Twitter.The central bank is in a difficult position. The hope is that by stabilizing the value of the currency, the interest rate increase will reduce the sense of financial panic and rapid outflows of money. Russians have pulled more than $100 billion in capital from the country this year. But the increase could also choke off growth in a Russian economy already reeling from falling oil prices. Oil and natural gas make up about 60 percent of Russia\u2019s export earnings.Earlier Monday, the Russian central bank said it expected the country\u2019s economy to contract 4.5 percent in 2015 if oil prices averaged $60 a barrel. Oil is now hovering around that level. The central bank had been striving to keep rates low to bolster business activity and growth. It shifted to raising rates only last spring after the Ukraine crisis put additional pressure on the ruble. Since then, the central bank has steadily increased rates in relatively small increments. Just last Thursday, it increased rates to 10.5 percent, from 9.5 percent.The dead-of-night action seemed to catch even seasoned market watchers by surprise. Russian news agencies close to the government described it in unusually breathless terms.Noting the \u201crapid collapse of the ruble,\u201d the Interfax news agency declared that the central bank had gone to \u201cemergency measures, leaving far behind the most radical assumptions of analysts.\u201dAnalysts said that the rate increase might be a last-ditch move by the Russian government to try to contain the drop in the currency without adopting controls on the flow of capital or other more extensive measures to keep money in the country. \u201cIf today\u2019s measures fail to stem the ruble rout, there is a high probability that policy will veer in a more unorthodox direction,\u201d said Alexander Kliment, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, in a research note. \u201cSome top advisers to Putin are openly hostile to rate hikes.\u201dAndrew Ross Sorkin, whose\nDealBook column normally appears\non this page, is away.David M.

{"Headline": "The Elusive Chinese Dream", "Date": "2014-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn 1989, Chinese cities were rocked by huge protests, most notably the Tiananmen Square crackdown, while in Europe, the Berlin Wall fell and talk of a global Marxist-Leninist extinction began. Many observers, both in China and abroad, assumed that the Chinese Communist Party was on its last legs. How wrong we were. A quarter-century later, the party \u2014 the world\u2019s largest political organization, with 86 million members \u2014 seems as robust as ever. China\u2019s geopolitical clout is greater than it has ever been in modern times, and the size of its economy has just surpassed that of the United States. The party has, in President Xi Jinping, a strong leader who often strikes a supremely self-confident tone. He makes bold claims to islands in the East and South China Seas that neighboring countries insist are theirs. He chides Mikhail S. Gorbachev for having failed to be \u201cmanly\u201d enough to hold the Soviet empire together. And he encourages the state media to promulgate the idea that the \u201cChinese dream\u201d \u2014 a grand process of national resurgence that will return China to the position of global centrality it enjoyed before a \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d at the hands of the West, and Japan, between 1842 and 1949 \u2014 is about to be realized. And he insists that, when it is, this will satisfy not just his aspirations but those of \u201ceach Chinese person.\u201d Mr. Xi\u2019s self-assurance is not surprising, but his words and deeds betray a deep vein of insecurity. The talk of 1.3 billion people dreaming the same \u201cChinese dream\u201d can\u2019t hide the fact that China\u2019s leaders continue to be plagued by nightmares not unlike those that haunted them in 1989. Under Mr. Xi the party has carried out a fierce crackdown aimed at limiting dissent, often described as the harshest since 1989. It has tightened control over the press and social media. It has relentlessly censored coverage of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. It has prosecuted activist lawyers who favor peaceful reform within the existing system. It has scrutinized the teaching of history in classrooms. And it has ramped up scare tactics against members of restive minority groups, such as the largely Muslim Uighur community \u2014 staging swift, secret trials and public executions of those accused of terrorism, and sentencing a moderate Uighur scholar to life in prison. To understand these actions, we need to look more closely at what exactly bombastic talk of a shared Chinese dream means \u2014 and what it obscures. Mr. Xi\u2019s dream envisions a country that has completed a process of economic and geopolitical resurgence that began with Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s. In this fantasy, a modern, stable and unified China has resumed its traditional place as East Asia\u2019s dominant power, led by a party that, despite its recent focus on rapid growth and its roots in an ideology imported from abroad, has reconnected so fully with China\u2019s deep past that it has become natural for people of Chinese descent around the world, from Macau to Manhattan, to look to Beijing for authoritative pronouncements about the relevance of Confucian classics for contemporary problems. (The irony of reviving Confucius, who for years was denounced as the intellectual wellspring of feudalism and backwardness, is lost on few Chinese.) It was under Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessor, Hu Jintao, in office from 2002 to 2012, that growth rates soared, the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, with their high-tech venues and soaring ceremonies, wowed global audiences, and China launched a flashy space program. Mr. Xi has gone further even than Mr. Hu in trying to show that symbols of the old and the new, the classical and the revolutionary, Confucius and Mao, can be synthesized.If the dream\u2019s realization is close at hand, what is there to fear? Plenty, it turns out. One specter that continues to cause anxiety is a possible recurrence of the wave of protests that erupted in 1989. Newer fears include a Chinese variant of the Arab Spring and a possible economic crisis, triggered by a collapse of the inflated housing bubble, that would undermine the party\u2019s basis of legitimacy: its ability to steadily raise living standards.Perhaps the most urgent fear is this: a sense among even those Chinese whose living standards have soared that frantic development has come at too high a price. Never in history have the promise and peril of head-spinning modernization been so apparent within the space of a single lifetime. A country where the authorities call the air in the capital \u201cfine\u201d on days when nearby skyscrapers are completely shrouded from view, where waterways are suddenly and inexplicably clogged by enormous numbers of pig carcasses, where once-revered elders live in rural poverty and isolation \u2014 this is the stuff of nightmares. The party\u2019s anxiety over these bad dreams can be seen in many things \u2014 in its calls for official think tanks to study carefully the \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d that toppled East European and Central Asian autocrats, and in the suggestion that party cadres read de Tocqueville\u2019s account of the French Revolution, to ensure that China avoids the mistakes of the ancien r\u00e9gime.Beijing\u2019s handling of the Hong Kong situation was the latest illustration of the party\u2019s fear that its grip on the national rejuvenation package is weaker than outsiders sometimes imagine. What was striking was not just the party\u2019s refusal to make concessions to the protesters, but the lengths to which it went to control information about, and even photographs of, the Hong Kong protests from flowing into the mainland \u2014 and to present a locally rooted popular movement as the brainchild of foreign conspirators. Officials told a British delegation planning to investigate the situation in Hong Kong that it would be barred from setting foot in the former British colony, which typically does not require Western visitors to obtain visas.Hong Kong\u2019s protesters often spoke of their attachment to a distinctive and robustly cosmopolitan civic identity, as opposed to any kind of Chinese national one. And yet the symbolic challenge they presented to Mr. Xi was very significant. The eclectic imagery of their movement \u2014 in which quotations from international figures like John Lennon were placed beside statements by Chinese writers like Lu Xun \u2014 showed that there were other, perhaps more compelling, ways to make elements of China\u2019s culture and past speak to 21st-century concerns than the mainland\u2019s heavy-handed patriotism. It made the Communist Party profoundly uneasy to watch Hong Kong youth show such creativity and determination and demonstrate so clearly how misleading it is for Mr. Xi to claim that \u201ceach Chinese person\u201d is capable of dreaming only the party\u2019s authoritarian dream. Thus the lurch from bravado to paranoia.One of Chairman Mao\u2019s favorite words was \u201ccontradictions,\u201d and today\u2019s China is riddled with them: rule by a party that is nominally Communist, but embraces consumerism and welcomes entrepreneurs into its ranks; widespread unease about the environmental, social and even moral consequences of growth; deep insecurity in the ranks of a party that outwardly brims with confidence. The dark side of the Chinese dream \u2014 the negative fantasy that haunts China\u2019s psyche \u2014 explains why Mr. Xi, the strongest Chinese leader since Deng, is so skittish, so ready to jump at shadows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Good Economic News, but Democrats Differ on Whether to Take Credit ", "Date": "2014-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWashington MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats would like some credit for the run of good economic news. Yet the better those reports are, the more divided the party has become over how \u2014 even whether \u2014 to take any.In one camp are Democrats who argue that if they do not take some credit, they will continue to receive little. Others counter that boasting would backfire, infuriating millions of Americans who do not see the economy improving for them or their children.Many, including President Obama, fall in the middle: still seeking to strike some balance, more than five years after the recovery officially began, between extolling progress and recognizing the pain that lingers.\u201cWe are in a message knot right now and we have to untie it,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, recently named by the House Democrats\u2019 leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi, to head a new policy and communications unit.\u201cOn the one hand, when we talk about the progress in the economy, most middle-class voters don\u2019t feel that progress, and they believe we\u2019re out of touch,\u201d Mr. Israel said. \u201cOn the other hand, if we don\u2019t talk about progress on the economy, we cede the narrative to Republicans and lose.\u201dThat conundrum remains a problem for Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats, who are a minority in the House and will also be a minority in the Senate when the new Congress convenes next year. Soon, however, it will be the defining challenge for the Democratic nominee to succeed Mr. Obama, whether it is Hillary Rodham Clinton or someone else. Even if the economy keeps growing \u2014 as many economists expect \u2014 prosperity could continue to elude many Americans, given forces predating the Great Recession that are depressing wage growth and widening income inequality.Absent those trends, familiar economic indicators that long determined the popularity of the party in the White House should have Democrats humming \u201cHappy Days are Here Again,\u201d their New Deal-era theme.The jobless rate, at 10 percent at its peak after Mr. Obama took office, is down to 5.8 percent with nearly 11 million new jobs. The annual deficit, which reached 10.1 percent of the gross domestic product, the measure of the economy, has fallen below 3 percent of G.D.P., the level most economists consider acceptable. Gasoline is less than $3 a gallon on average, as the United States has become the world\u2019s top energy producer. Exports are up, and so are consumer and business confidence.Yet voters preferred Republicans to Democrats, 39 percent to 30 percent, to deal with the economy, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll before the Nov. 4 midterm elections. This comes just a year after congressional Republicans forced a government shutdown that hurt economic growth, private forecasters said.Many Democrats blame Mr. Obama for not articulating a consistent and cogent economic message, but as president and party leader, he is necessarily at the center of the debate, buffeted by all sides.Geoff Garin, a pollster who works with congressional Democrats, pressed David Simas, the White House political director, before the midterm elections to have the president talk more about how his policies have contributed to economic progress. The idea was for Mr. Obama to provide a positive national message even as vulnerable Democrats avoided the unpopular president and emphasized local issues.\u201cThe Democrats have always been a house divided on whether you ever talk about good news on the economy when so many people are not feeling the benefit of it,\u201d Mr. Garin said. But, he added, \u201cAfter six years in office, you better have some positive outcomes to talk about.\u201dMore recently Stan Greenberg, another pollster, went to the White House to make the opposite case to Mr. Simas. Mr. Greenberg, perhaps the most vocal Democrat against taking credit for the economy, was alarmed that Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks lauding the November jobs report might signal a new, boastful turn in his rhetoric.\u201cI think the economy is going to grow and unemployment drop over the next couple years, and I think by the end of his presidency, we may be surprised that his approval ratings are up because of the stronger economy,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cSo it\u2019ll be a great speech as he\u2019s leaving, or breaking ground on the Obama presidential library, but it\u2019s not a message for Democrats now. People are in trouble.\u201dMr. Greenberg, an adviser to Bill Clinton when Mr. Clinton was running for president in 1992, recalled how the Clinton campaign clobbered President George Bush for saying that the economy was emerging from recession when most Americans thought otherwise. The strategist was not alone in remembering that contest as a lesson against premature or clumsy credit-taking.\u201cI do remember how jarring it was when George Herbert Walker Bush was running for re-election and said the economy is a lot better than people think it is,\u201d said Norman J. Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cAnd we all laughed because what mattered was how people thought it was. That\u2019s the dilemma that Democrats have.\u201dTheir efforts to resolve it continue. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a member of the Senate Democratic leadership, argued in a speech Nov. 25 that Democrats should advocate specific policies to unabashedly make the argument that the government can be the champion of the middle class, although he received attention mostly for saying that Mr. Obama prematurely pursued his health-insurance law in 2010.\u201cWe should not be afraid to point out our accomplishments,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in an interview. But, \u201cAs long as middle-class incomes decline, you can put out whatever statistic you want, and the average citizen is still unhappy.\u201dMr. Obama will argue that he has \u201cset out a new foundation that we wanted to lay: Wall Street reform, health care, energy,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior strategist. Mr. Pfeiffer said the next step \u201cis to build on that success and be able to expand the circle of opportunity so that more Americans share in the prosperity.\u201dBut for a lame-duck president to sell that message better than he has, Mr. Obama will need continued good economic news. And congressional Democrats, whatever parallel agenda they devise, have to wish him well.\u201cThe reality is,\u201d said Mr. Garin, the pollster, \u201cwhen your party has the White House, it\u2019s not possible to communicate successfully from any other venue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But a bag of macadamia nuts?This was no ordinary executive on Korean Air Flight 86, as it turned out: Cho Hyun-ah was not only in charge of in-flight service for Korean Air, but is also a daughter of the chairman of the family-run conglomerate that operates the airline.Ms. Cho, who resigned Tuesday after an outburst of another sort of rage \u2014 on social and traditional media \u2014 became irate on Friday after a flight attendant served nuts without first asking her, and in an unopened package instead of on a plate.She summoned the chief flight attendant and grilled him on the rules for serving nuts. He fumbled, Korean Air officials said, and Ms. Cho wanted him out, then and there.Bloggers ridiculed Ms. Cho, who also uses the given name Heather, for \u201cgoing nuts over nuts.\u201d \u201cShe is a national embarrassment to all of us,\u201d one Internet user said on Korean Air\u2019s official Facebook page. Some even likened the Cho family to that of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who rules that country as a totalitarian fief.By Tuesday, with many South Koreans calling for a boycott of Korean Air, which they nicknamed \u201cAir Nuts,\u201d the airline announced that Ms. Cho had resigned as the head of in-flight services, though not as a vice president. \u201cI am sorry for causing trouble to the passengers and the people,\u201d Ms. Cho said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cI seek forgiveness from those who were hurt by what I did.\u201dKorean Air said the jet was only about 35 feet from the gate at Kennedy International Airport when it returned. Still, the airline acknowledged that the decision had been \u201cexcessive\u201d because there was no emergency. But the company also offered an excuse for Ms. Cho\u2019s behavior, saying that it was \u201cnatural\u201d for her to chastise the crew for improper in-flight service, and that the decision to take the plane back to the gate had been made in consultation with the pilot. That explanation, however, failed to soothe an angry South Korean public.The episode cannot be explained \u201cexcept by the fact that Vice President Cho Hyun-ah was a member of the chairman\u2019s family,\u201d said the civic group People\u2019s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy. It said the case exemplified how the personal wishes of a member of the family that owns a leading South Korean conglomerate often override official regulations and common sense.\u201cNo pilot is going to oppose an order from the daughter of the company owner,\u201d said Lee Gae-ho, a lawmaker affiliated with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the main opposition party.The South Korean Transportation Ministry said it was investigating whether Ms. Cho\u2019s behavior had violated the country\u2019s aviation safety laws, which bar passengers from causing disturbances, like using violent language or yelling. Local news media reported that Ms. Cho had screamed at the crew.A handful of family-controlled conglomerates dominate the South Korean economy. Although they own relatively small stakes in their corporate empires \u2014 the Cho family owns about 10 percent of Korean Air, for instance \u2014 they are known to wield unchallenged authority over subsidiaries. The units are interlocked by cross-shareholdings, and family members and loyal executives occupy important posts. Ms. Cho\u2019s father, Cho Yang-ho, the chairman of the Hanjin Group, has placed his three children in executive perches in the conglomerate, which also runs shipping, logistics and hotel businesses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Ruble Falters, Russia Forces Exporters to Reduce Foreign Currency", "Date": "2014-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile controversial, the move highlighted the additional leverage available to the Russian government as a result of Mr. Putin\u2019s re-exertion of state control throughout the economy, particularly in the energy sector. It also seemed to underscore the anxiety and consternation at the highest levels of the government over the mounting economic woes.In public remarks on Tuesday, the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said that without careful planning and more aggressive action, the country risked falling into an even \u201cdeeper recession.\u201d And while Mr. Medvedev said that Russia had navigated successfully through previous downturns, Western sanctions will make recovery harder this time.\u201cA number of countries are effectively hampering the development of our economy,\u201d Mr. Medvedev said at a meeting of the ruling United Russia political party, which he leads. \u201cThis is bad; this is sad. But, of course, we will survive this.\u201dIn Washington on Tuesday, a State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, expressed confidence in the effectiveness of the sanctions. \u201cToday I think the Russians know they have a choice,\u201d Ms. Harf said at a news conference. \u201cThey can drive their economy further into a hole, or they can take a step back and live up to their international obligations.\u201dThe ruble, while still down sharply for the year, has recovered a bit in recent days. On Tuesday, it remained steady at just under 55 to the dollar. In addition to Gazprom and Rosneft, the other corporations that will be forced to limit their foreign currency holdings are Zarubezhneft, an energy development company wholly owned by the government, as well as Alrosa, a government-controlled conglomerate of diamond mining firms, and PO Kristall, a government-owned polished diamond manufacturer.In its announcement, the Russian government said that it would convene a meeting of the boards of directors of each company and that \u201cthe representatives of the interests of the Russian Federation\u201d would vote to require that by March 1 \u201cthe amounts of net currency assets\u201d are brought \u201cto the level not exceeding that as of October 1, 2014.\u201dThe government added that the central bank would oversee the process, and the companies would be required \u201cto present on the weekly basis to the Bank of Russia reports on the amounts of net currency assets of the company.\u201dIt was not clear how much foreign currency the five exporters would have to sell to comply with the government\u2019s directive. But Kommersant, one of Russia\u2019s leading business newspapers, said combined sales could total $1 billion a day until March 1.Some analysts had warned that if other government measures to support the ruble failed, the Russian government could be forced to impose currency controls \u2014 a step that could be perceived in the market as a sign of panic.And some critics on Tuesday said the pressure on the government-owned companies amounted to soft controls, intended to accomplish the same goal, and in that way exposed the limits of Russia\u2019s supposed free market.Taking a jab at Mr. Putin, he added, \u201cThe emperor with no clothes decided that these days it\u2019s not proper for his retinue to wear clothes either.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By Wednesday evening, amid indications of a government intervention in the currency markets, the ruble had recovered more than 11 percent of the previous day\u2019s losses.Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev met with the leaders of Russian business, energy exporters like Rosneft and Gazprom, and others, pledging government support for business and the ruble. And President Vladimir V. Putin is on deck, scheduled to hold a nationally televised news conference on Thursday in which he is expected to address the recent financial turmoil.\u201cThe Central Bank and the government have worked out a package of measures to stabilize the situation,\u201d Mr. Medvedev said, according to a government transcript. \u201cWe will act in a coordinated way here. What we are seeing today is mostly playing on emotions.\u201dIt was a notable turnaround from the previous evening, when Russians with rubles in hand fanned out to foreign currency exchanges and electronics stores, looking to beat looming price increases.Opponents of Mr. Putin lined up to declare that his title as a guarantor of economic stability had been proved false.The Russian authorities \u201care finally beginning to join up the dots, and think collectively, to try and reassure markets,\u201d said Timothy Ash, head of emerging-market research at Standard Bank, in an investors\u2019 note on Wednesday afternoon.Public opinion in support of measures had reached a fever pitch as the ruble plummeted to 80 to the dollar on Tuesday.\u201cThis is a very dangerous situation; we are separated from a fully fledged run on the banks by just a few days,\u201d Vedomosti, the country\u2019s leading business broadsheet, wrote in an editorial on Wednesday morning. \u201cIf the currency market is not reassured right now, the banking system will require large external support.\u201dThe economic turmoil has nurtured a dark humor. Ivan Urgant, a 36-year-old comedian akin to Jimmy Fallon, spoofed recent advertisements for the Google mobile operating system on his late-night show with a skit called \u201cO.K., Ruble.\u201d\u201cBetter not to go anywhere,\u201d the robotic voice in his telephone responds when he asks where to ring in the New Year. When he asks what the exchange rate for the ruble will be tomorrow, the phone suggests watching a video of kittens playing.There were other signs that the government was making entreaties to Russia\u2019s business community. On Wednesday evening, Russian prosecutors unexpectedly freed Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov, the oligarch owner of the Sistema conglomerate, from house arrest during an investigation of what critics dismiss as trumped-up charges of embezzlement. The accusations and seizure of Bashneft, an oil producer that he acquired in 2009, had been seen as a significant blow to property rights in Russia.He was not freed, however, before Bashneft was nationalized.The announcement drew parallels to Mr. Putin\u2019s unexpected pardoning a year ago of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the jailed Russian oligarch considered the country\u2019s most famous political prisoner, at his annual news conference.With Mr. Putin set to speak tomorrow, his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on national television Wednesday that there was cause for some optimism for the Russian economy.\u201cIn 2008, if you remember, Putin came out and said, \u2018It is a crisis, I am assuming responsibility, everything will turn out right,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Peskov said. \u201cDid it turn out right?

Why eliminate an entire class of Teamsters union jobs? How will the horses escape slaughter? What will happen to the stables, on coveted property on the West Side of Manhattan? (Not for nothing do people wonder why the force behind NYClass, the group pushing the anticarriage crusade, is a real estate developer, Stephen Nislick.)

And a big share of Google searches are shopping queries, particularly at this time of year.ClothingAccessoriesConventional wisdom is that when shopping for a woman, you cannot go wrong with jewelry or a handbag. The Southeast has a penchant for jewelry from Pandora, a Danish company that makes understated jewelry like charm bracelets. Dallas likes Michael Kors watches. Los Angeles prefers $800 bucket bags by Mansur Gavriel, and Minneapolis $80 floral totes by Vera Bradley. Indianapolis is the most extravagant on our list, shopping for Louis Vuitton, whose bags sell for a few thousand dollars.ShoesWhen it comes to shoes, we\u2019re following in the footsteps of Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Kevin Durant, as searches for the brands of the popular National Basketball Association players were more popular this month in a number of cities. Comfort appears to be a priority in Philadelphia, where men\u2019s Ugg boots were more popular, and in Minneapolis, where interest in the home-state Minnetonka moccasins surged compared with last year. A flood of searches for rain boots in San Francisco may have more to do with the recent torrential rainfall there \u2014 a welcome respite from drought conditions in California \u2014 than holiday shopping, but retailers probably won\u2019t complain.Tech GadgetsPerhaps nothing reveals our culture\u2019s fickle desires more than the device du jour.

If San Francisco leads the way in adopting new technology, expect smartwatches and wireless chargers to become widespread soon.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Up Next in New York?", "Date": "2014-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the facade of many a New York City apartment building is the dissonant sound of residents complaining. The gripes that make their way to the inbox of my Ask Real Estate column offer a glimpse into how residents cope with the myriad irritations that come with living in cramped and costly homes. They include the co-op shareholder horrified by a neighbor\u2019s rats\u2019 nest; the parents whose building has barred them from using a stroller in the elevator; and the renter whose kitchen cabinets fell from the walls. In short, some New Yorkers dislike their neighbors almost as much as they do their landlords. Co-op and condominium boards beware: You do not fare much better. The questions New Yorkers ask the column are dictated not only by their individual circumstances but also by the larger issues of the day, like rising housing costs, gentrification and shoddy construction. In the end, 2014 was a year of things going up \u2014 home prices, rents and, above all, buildings, with 16,700 units approved for construction through October, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.So what forces will shape the questions asked next year? It depends on who (and where) you are. While buyers should brace for another year of high-stakes bidding wars, residents of the city\u2019s far-flung neighborhoods (I\u2019m talking about you, Grand Concourse) should be ready for an onslaught of prospective residents seeking bargains \u2014 bargains, that is, relative to the gilded ZIP codes that are out of the reach of most mortals. For the New Yorkers who have turned their apartments into bed-and-breakfasts, the battle over illegal inns could reach a fever pitch. On top of it all, Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s 10-year affordable housing plan will take shape just as legislation in Albany threatens to strain the pocketbooks of renters. These are among the game-changers looming as we ring in the New Year.NeighborhoodsThis year, the average sales price for an apartment in New York City topped $1 million, a milestone with far-reaching implications. As the city\u2019s population soars, prices and buildings are rising in neighborhoods that missed the last housing boom. \u201cWhen I started in this business, Brooklyn was the alternative. Now it is a choice,\u201d said Diane M. Ramirez, the chief executive of Halstead Property. \u201cI see Queens becoming that way. The Bronx is not that far down the line.\u201d Of the 6,527 new rentals scheduled to hit the market in Brooklyn next year, 1,442 are in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick and Clinton Hill, all considered off the beaten path not that long ago, according to data provided by Citi Habitats. For newcomers, these changes provide fresh housing options. But for residents, they can spell displacement. The same is true for shops such as De Robertis Pasticceria and Caffe in the East Village, which just closed after a 110-year run. And next year, the Union Square Cafe will likely conclude its 30 years in Union Square.\u201cNew Yorkers have been waking up and realizing this long period of prosperity has wreaked a little bit of havoc on things that we think of as classic New York,\u201d said Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the Historic Districts Council, noting that 2015 will mark the 50th anniversary of the New York City landmarks preservation law. \u201cThings we always thought were going to be there are just closing left and right.\u201dNext year, the mayor\u2019s affordable housing plan, which calls for building or preserving 200,000 units of affordable housing over the next decade, will begin to take shape. It hinges on a policy that requires developers to build affordable housing in exchange for being allowed to construct taller and denser buildings in neighborhoods rezoned by the city. Developers and housing advocates alike are waiting to see what it will look like once the administration adds muscle and flesh to the bones of the proposal.\u201cOur goal is to produce as many units as we can and, at the same time, make sure that we do it in a way that maintains and enhances the health of neighborhoods,\u201d said Carl Weisbrod, the director of the Department of City Planning.East New York in Brooklyn will be the test case when the Department of City Planning presents initial recommendations early next year. After that, the rezoning process could begin for the neighborhood, among the city\u2019s poorest. A proposal for west Flushing in Queens is next.\u201cWe need to do what the mayor wants everybody to do, and that is build more housing,\u201d said Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. However, \u201cif the numbers don\u2019t work, if the rent that is coming in is less than the cost of maintaining the building, then you are not going to do it.\u201dBuyers and SellersAll-cash buyers. Skittish lenders. Skyrocketing prices. Anemic listings. These realities haunt buyers, turning the house hunt into a demoralizing slog. Unfortunately, buyers will probably have to soldier through another year of a market that favors sellers.\u201cOur population and employment is at an all-time high and growing. That puts significant pressure on rents and prices,\u201d said Mark Willis, the executive director of the New York University Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. \u201cThere is no reason now to think that these trends are likely to change.\u201dBuyers looking for new construction will have more options next year, as the number of new condos hitting the market in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Long Island City, Queens, is expected to more than double to 8,366 from 3,444 in 2014, according to data provided by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.But a quick look at the changing skyline betrays a frustrating reality: Those shiny new towers have failed to deliver the type of housing most New Yorkers can afford. \u201cThere is a disconnect between what we\u2019re building and what we need to build,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. \u201c2015 is going to be more of that.\u201dHomeowners in neighborhoods like the Grand Concourse in the Bronx or Elmhurst in Queens could enjoy new attention from buyers eager to find the next untapped market. \u201cWhen have you heard talk about Kingsbridge in the Bronx?\u201d asked Ms. Ramirez of Halstead. \u201cThe people who are smart are getting out there and buying it up at wonderful prices.\u201dRentersHere is a silver lining: Market-rate rents are so high that they probably will not climb much higher next year. \u201cThe good news is rents aren\u2019t rising anymore,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThe bad news is they are probably not going to fall.\u201dNew construction will provide luxury options for renters with deep pockets, mostly in the boroughs outside Manhattan. In Brooklyn, 6,527 new rental units are expected to hit the rental market next year, nearly twice the 3,802 units anticipated for Manhattan, according to Citi Habitats. Meanwhile, New Yorkers living in the city\u2019s nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments should brace for a fight in Albany in June, when the rent-stabilization law expires. Housing advocates hope to see a reversal of a rule that allows landlords to deregulate vacant units if the rent reaches $2,500 a month. \u201cThis is our make or break moment for the tenant movement,\u201d said Ilana Maier, the program director for the Metropolitan Council on Housing. \u201cIf we aren\u2019t able to drastically strengthen the rules now, none of this will matter in 10 years.\u201d But with a Republican-controlled State Senate, opponents of rent stabilization doubt that 2015 will be a watershed year for the tenants\u2019 movement. Sherwin Belkin, a lawyer who represents landlords, said: \u201cLandlords view this as an opportunity to make some much-needed changes to rent regulation.\u201d One suggested change: require rent-stabilized tenants to verify their income.Airbnb ShowdownIn New York it is illegal for anyone to rent out a room in an apartment in a multifamily building for less than 30 days if a tenant is not present. Yet almost weekly, someone writes to Ask Real Estate seeking advice on how to skirt the rules. What if I swap apartments? What if nothing is in writing? A reckoning could come next year as the state and city attempt a crackdown on renegade hoteliers while the online company Airbnb lobbies for a change to the law. \u201cYou are going to see an increased push to regulate this,\u201d said Samuel J. Himmelstein, a lawyer who represents tenants. Making Airbnb go away might not be so easy. A recent Quinnipiac poll found that 56 percent of the responders thought New Yorkers should be allowed to rent rooms out to strangers. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to turn into hotels, but at the same time people want to rent out their apartments sometimes,\u201d said Paul R. Gottsegen, the president of Halstead Management Company, which manages 250 residential properties in the city. Condos and co-ops have been laying down the law, writing warning memos and fining wayward residents. For renters, breaking the rules could jeopardize a lease. Condos are tightening security, asking doormen to scrutinize visitors and requiring residents to sign authorization forms for guests. The practice has also raised insurance concerns.Nevertheless, as New Yorkers grow accustomed to a sharing economy, buildings might ultimately have to embrace it. \u201cAirbnb is here to stay,\u201d Mr. Gottsegen said. \u201cInstead of fighting it, we should wrap our arms around it and make it better.\u201dCo-ops and CondosFrom maintenance to flip taxes, condo and co-op owners often complain of boards bleeding them dry. Unfortunately, the cost of running a building will not get any cheaper anytime soon.Over the next few years, large residential buildings will have to comply with Local Law 87, which requires them to audit energy usage and keep systems running at peak efficiency. Residential buildings are the city\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 37 percent of the total. \u201cThe one hot-button topic is energy. How do buildings become more energy efficient?\u201d said Dan Wurtzel, the president of FirstService Residential New York, which manages more than 500 properties. \u201cIf a third of your operating budget is related to energy and you can now reduce that cost, you can take pressure off the need for a maintenance increase.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for that?\u201d said Marc J. Luxemburg, the president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. \u201cThis has a real-world cost for many buildings.\u201d \u00a0Although various public incentives exist, many come in the form of tax breaks, low-interest loans or rebates. So a building might have to levy an assessment or raise maintenance to cover initial costs. \u201cYou run into the problem of nobody giving you the money upfront,\u201d Mr. Luxemburg said.These are just some of the issues that will face New Yorkers next year. And then there\u2019s the new drum set the neighbor\u2019s son received for Christmas ... Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adidos and Hotwind? In China, Brands Adopt Names to Project Foreign Flair", "Date": "2014-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by12 PhotosEager to glaze their products with the sheen of international sophistication, many homegrown retail brands have hit upon a similar formula: Choose a non-Chinese name that gives the impression of being foreign.At a time when manufacturing is cooling and real estate is slumping, consumption is a bright spot in the Chinese economy. In the first 11 months of 2014, retail sales grew by 12 percent over the previous year to 23.66 trillion renminbi, or $3.8 trillion, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.The government considers consumer spending so vital that Prime Minister Li Keqiang in November declared, \u201cLet the people be able to consume, dare to consume and be willing to consume,\u201d according to the state news agency Xinhua.But some Chinese appear loath to spend their disposable income on locally produced fashions.\u201cBuy Chinese brands? Never,\u201d said Fu Rao, 20, a university student, who was browsing the clothes at the Japanese outlet store Snidel in an upscale Beijing mall one recent evening. Ms. Fu complained that Chinese products were shoddily made and lacking in style. \u201cForeign stuff is so much better,\u201d she said.As Chinese retail companies try to attract consumers, mystifying maladaptations of English have spread across the country\u2019s storefronts, shopping bags and clothing labels. Wanko, Hotwind, Scat, Orgee and Marisfrolg (the L is silent) all sell clothing. A sponsor of China\u2019s national golf team is the apparel chain Biemlfdlkk.If Chinese companies have stumbled in the branding race, that is because few ever gave it much thought. For years, as China\u2019s economic growth soared into the double digits, branding was largely considered a low-priority marketing decision left to top executives far more concerned with the next product introduction than with building long-term value, said Joel Backaler, author of \u201cChina Goes West,\u201d a book that charts the efforts of Chinese companies seeking to build international brands.Some local companies have gone the same route, employing phonetic if meaningless brand names to obtain a foreign-sounding flair, even though they are actually homegrown.The golf apparel brand Biemlfdlkk, sold in over 450 Chinese stores, goes by Biyinlefen in Mandarin, using four characters that translate literally as \u201ccompare music rein fragrant.\u201d While the name may be ambiguous by design, it can make creating a uniform brand identity difficult. A Biemlfdlkk saleswoman in the southern city of Guangzhou explained, \u201cIt\u2019s a German name.\u201d An employee at another Biemlfdlkk shop had a different explanation: \u201cIt\u2019s the name of a French designer.\u201dThe knockoff casual wear brand Clio Coddle has a green crocodile logo reminiscent of Lacoste. Across China, sneakers are emblazoned with Adidos, Hike, Cnoverse and Fuma \u2014 featuring a smoking puma \u2014 and there are SQNY batteries and Johnnie Worker Red Labial whiskey.Reached by phone, a Chrisdien Deny representative denied that the brand was trying to piggyback on the reputation of Christian Dior, which has dozens of stores in China. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that company,\u201d said the representative, who declined to give her name. Christian Dior declined to comment.Chrisdien Deny has no Chinese-language brand name and is a subsidiary of Huayu Group Holdings Ltd., based in Guangzhou. Huayu claims to be the Far East distributor of the \u201ccentury-old European brand\u201d Chrisdien Deny, according to its employee recruiting materials.Chinese brand names have stoked international controversy in the past. One of China\u2019s most popular toothpaste brands is known as Darlie in English but Hei Ren, or Black People, in Mandarin. In 1985, Colgate-Palmolive bought 50 percent of the Hong Kong company that owned the brand, which was then called Darkie in English. Its logo was a grinning minstrel in blackface wearing a top hat, tuxedo and bow tie.Helen Keller glasses would probably have a hard time selling overseas, too. Though the company\u2019s website includes a lengthy biography of Helen Keller, it omits all mention of the disabilities she worked hard to overcome.Reached by phone, a brand manager found nothing problematic about the omission. \u201cSo she\u2019s blind and deaf \u2014 her personal shortcomings are not related to the spirit of our brand,\u201d said the woman, who gave only her surname, Jiang. \u201cThese products help you love and protect your eyes. Why would that be offensive?\u201dFacing rising labor costs and increased competition, businesses are now thinking more carefully about brand identity, analysts say. \u201cYesterday\u2019s strategy is no longer effective,\u201d said Mr. Backaler, the \u201cChina Goes West\u201d author.Labbrand has developed over 200 brand names for Western companies entering the Chinese market and Chinese companies looking to build global brands. Labbrand\u2019s president, Mr. Djurovic, said the company\u2019s work creating brand names in the Latin alphabet has increased significantly in recent years, suggesting that Chinese companies are beginning to realize they cannot just transliterate their Mandarin brand names or mimic Western ones if they hope to win the loyalties of customers, not just in China but around the world.So far, only a few domestic brands have succeeded abroad, mostly in high tech. One notable exception is Haier, the world\u2019s top electronic home appliance brand for the last five years, according to the market research firm Euromonitor International.At home, one of the toughest challenges for local brands is Chinese consumers themselves. Suby Zhou, 27, a property rights manager, said she did not see much difference between local and foreign brands. \u201cEverything\u2019s so international now,\u201d she said, while shopping at a Uniqlo outlet in Beijing.Still, the power of foreign branding has left an indelible impression. Ms. Zhou could easily rattle off foreign brands she liked, among them Zara and H&M, but when asked about favored Chinese brands she drew a blank. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any,\u201d she said.An article on Saturday about Chinese companies that adopt variations of international brand names described incorrectly the font of the logo of Chrisdien Deny, a Chinese apparel chain. It is similar to that of Christian Dior, but it is not the same.Chen Jiehao and Becky Davis contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Treasury Chief Reports Strong Growth, but Deficit Is \u2018Too High\u2019", "Date": "2014-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Still battling to clean up Britain\u2019s public finances, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, on Wednesday offered limited giveaways to Britons but claimed credit for delivering them rapid economic growth. It was his last big economic policy statement before the country\u2019s national election next spring.Mr. Osborne said that the government would ensure that big multinational businesses \u201cpay their fair share of tax\u201d \u2014 a response to complaints that companies including Google and Starbucks have used complex accounting arrangements to limit their tax liability in Britain.\u201cSome of the largest companies in the world, including those in the tech sector, use elaborate structures to avoid paying taxes,\u201d he said.How the new tax would be calculated has not yet been specified, although the Treasury said it would go into effect next April.Some tax experts, though, predicted that the plan would have minimal effect on the business and tax strategies of multinational companies.By several measures, Britain is Western Europe\u2019s economic success story, with one of the fastest levels of growth in major developed economies and rapidly falling unemployment. On Wednesday, the growth forecast for 2014 in Britain was upgraded to 3 percent, from the 2.7 percent predicted in March.That is on par with growth in the United States and much better than the economic performance in the 18-country eurozone currency union, of which Britain is not a member.But many of those new British jobs are paying low wages, productivity levels are continuing to disappoint, and tax receipts have fallen short of expectations.Just after he came to power in 2010, Prime Minister David Cameron promised to \u201cbalance the books\u201d within five years. On Wednesday, Mr. Osborne said that while the country\u2019s budget deficit was falling, it was \u201cstill too high,\u201d with borrowing projected at 91.3 billion pounds, or about $146 billion, this year and \u00a375.9 billion next year.National debt is now expected to exceed 80 percent of gross domestic product this year, peaking at just over 81 percent in 2015.That means that, whoever wins next year\u2019s elections, the austerity and squeeze on public spending that Britain has experienced after the financial crisis are destined to continue for several years.Nevertheless, after months in which the national discourse has been dominated by issues like immigration, Mr. Osborne is keen to steer the economy toward the center of the political debate. Opinion polls show that his Conservative Party is trusted by more voters on economic management than is the Labour Party, the main opposition in May\u2019s general election.On Wednesday, he urged Britons not to risk \u201cthe economic security we have gained\u201d and said that he had a \u201clong term economic plan on course to prosperity.\u201dMr. Osborne\u2019s most eye-catching announcement was a change to the stamp duty, a tax levied on the purchase of properties, to shift more of the burden onto higher-value homes. That appeared to be an attempt to pre-empt the opposition Labour Party\u2019s plans to place an annual \u201cmansion tax\u201d on expensive properties.He also described a measure to curb the losses from the financial crisis that banks can offset against their taxes.Concessions also included the abolition of air passenger taxes for children, and of a tax levied when pensions are inherited by spouses. Similarly, married people will also be able to inherit tax-free savings accounts from their partners without paying any duty.For all those voter tidbits, though, Mr. Osborne had few options to turn Wednesday\u2019s spending plan, known as the Autumn Statement, into a festive, pre-Christmas giveaway. That is because government borrowing remains stubbornly high, with a budget deficit of around 5.8 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 higher than many countries in the eurozone. The Autumn Statement is the treasury chief\u2019s stage for outlining the state of the nation\u2019s finances and the government\u2019s future tax and spending plans\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have anything like as much room for maneuver as he would like to have,\u201d said Philip Rush, chief British economist for Nomura in London. \u201cThere is no fiscal room to come out with a big pledge on tax cuts.\u201d\u201cThe fact that productivity has been weak means you have been creating a labor-intensive recovery,\u201d Mr. Rush added, \u201cand these are lower-paying jobs than the ones that were being created pre-crisis. The mix of jobs in the economy is relatively low skilled compared with beforehand. They are not generating the tax receipts you would have expected.\u201dMr. Rush said that Britain remained at risk if the global economic picture deteriorated. The country, he said, could be left with \u201can economy with no spare capacity but still a very large deficit,\u201d adding that \u201cin terms of the longer-term fundamentals, there is still a lot of weakness.\u201dBut for now, economic growth rates in Britain are the envy of most European finance ministers.Government officials attribute the country\u2019s relative success to the fact that Britain is outside the euro currency union and can set its own economic path. That is how its central bank, the Bank of England, was able to embrace a bond-buying stimulus program, called quantitative easing, which the United States Federal Reserve also employed to revive growth. The European Central Bank, trying to juggle the priorities of 18 different countries, has not yet heeded many economists\u2019 call to embark on a similar stimulus program.Moreover, the Cameron government, having introduced big spending cuts in 2010, showed flexibility when deficit reduction targets were missed and extended deadlines, rather than making further spending reductions that could have plunged the country back into recession. The eurozone\u2019s focus on deficit reduction and austerity budgets, by contrast, has been blamed for the protracted economic malaise in the currency bloc.Whether British voters are feeling the impact of growth enough to reward Mr. Osborne is a central question of next year\u2019s election. The Labour Party has campaigned hard against the cost of living, arguing that voters are being squeezed by the lack of real wage increases.\u201cThey promised living standards would rise, but while millionaires have got a huge tax cut, working people are \u00a31,600 a year worse off\u201d under the Conservatives, Ed Balls, who speaks for the Labour Party on the economy, said in a statement released on Wednesday before Mr. Osborne spoke.\u201cThis cost-of-living crisis is why the chancellor will have to admit he has broken his promise to balance the books by next year,\u201d Mr. Balls added, referring to Mr. Osborne.Wednesday\u2019s announcement was preceded by several days of government infrastructure pledges including \u00a32 billion, or about $3.1 billion, for health; \u00a315 billion for road-building; and \u00a32.3 billion for flood defenses.The government will also help finance the construction of up to 13,000 homes in a new \u201cgarden city\u201d in Bicester, in the county of Oxfordshire, west of London.But, while grabbing headlines, the infrastructure announcements did not involve new money. Instead, they laid out how Mr. Osborne would spend investment funds already budgeted for whatever government is elected next year.Before the last general election, the Conservative Party highlighted the need for budget consolidation, and some analysts say that message hampered their campaign. After the vote, Mr. Cameron became prime minister, but only by forming a coalition government with the centrist Liberal Democrats.In the Conservative Party, there is a lively debate about the appropriate level of optimism to sound on the economy this time. In October, Mr. Cameron promised that, if re-elected, he would make around \u00a37 billion in tax cuts by 2020. How this would be funded against the backdrop of weak public finances remains unclear.But the Conservatives are betting that discussion of the economy will play to their strengths, despite the disappointing progress on cutting debt and the deficit.\u201cThe government knows that it has a lot more credibility on the economy than Labour,\u201d Mr. Rush, the Nomura economist, said, \u201cand that it makes a lot of political sense for them to keep the debate on this area.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Putin\u2019s allies took control of VKontakte. Mr. Durov eventually sold his remaining stake for millions and fled Russia in April, after resisting government pressure to release the data of Ukrainian protest leaders.Mr. Durov, known for his subversive wit and an all-black wardrobe that evokes Neo from the \u201cMatrix\u201d movies, is now a little-seen nomad, moving from country to country every few weeks with a small band of computer programmers. One day he is in Paris, another in Singapore.\u201cMe myself, I\u2019m not a big fan of the idea of countries,\u201d Mr. Durov said, wearing a custom-made cross between a hoodie and a sport coat.His odyssey reflects the changing nature of the Internet in Russia.\u201cThe best thing about Russia at that time was the Internet sphere was completely not regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways, it was more liberal than the United States.\u201d\u201cSince I\u2019m obviously a believer in free markets,\u201d Mr. Durov said, \u201cit\u2019s hard for me to understand the current direction of the country.\u201dRussia\u2019s economy is also increasingly isolated, with its currency plummeting amid Western sanctions. The government is now predicting a recession for next year. Mr. Putin\u2019s big challenge is falling oil prices, which Mr. Durov calls \u201cthe only chance\u201d for economic and political reform.\u201cWhen the petrol prices are high, there is no incentive for those reforms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can stay like this forever; nobody really cares.\u201dAs the tensions in Russia play out, Mr. Durov says he is focused on Telegram, which he started last year.There will be no outside investors, he says, no ads and no marketing, and it is available free, though he is likely to eventually charge for additional services. He says he has about 50 million users, almost entirely outside Russia.While he is soft-spoken, his rebellious humor has gotten him in trouble, as he will be the first to admit.It created an outcry at a time of rising nationalism.Mr. Durov grinned. \u201cIt was a disaster.\u201dHe said that from his vantage point he couldn\u2019t see what was happening on the street and stopped when he was told people were fighting.\u201cI like to make fun of serious matters,\u201d he says, adding that he\u2019s closer to a Taoist or Buddhist. \u201cI\u2019m a peaceful creature; I\u2019m vegetarian. I don\u2019t like wars.\u201dMr. Durov learned programming from his brother, Nikolai, a mathematician and Mr. Durov\u2019s right-hand man at VKontakte and Telegram. By 11, the younger Mr. Durov was coding his own versions of games like Tetris. The two developed a strategy game set in ancient China, which they called Lao Unit.At St. Petersburg State University, Mr. Durov studied linguistics. In lieu of military service, he trained in propaganda, studying Sun Tzu, Genghis Khan and Napoleon, and he learned to make posters aimed at influencing foreign soldiers.The posters said things like \u201cYou are surrounded, surrender, there\u2019s no hope,\u201d or they would suggest to foreign soldiers that \u201csome other guy is entertaining himself with your wife,\u201d he recalled.His main interest was developing a social network. A friend who studied in America showed him Facebook, then in its infancy, and he learned from it.\u201cSome things like the layout of the early VKontakte was very influenced by Facebook,\u201d Mr. Durov said. \u201cOtherwise it could take ages for me to build, and I was not a professional designer.\u201dHe also recruited fellow linguistics students to build a database catering to the post-Soviet university system, a step he said gave VKontakte \u201ca tremendous competitive advantage.\u201d\u201cSome people told me when I was implementing it that I would go to jail the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cI was very careless.\u201d Demonstrations in 2011 over parliamentary elections resulted in a government showdown.

His visit came less than two weeks after the police in Hong Kong cleared the main camp of student-led pro-democracy demonstrators who had occupied several main intersections in the city for two and a half months.The protesters were upset with a limited proposal for electoral reform in Hong Kong put forward by the Chinese government.Mr. Leung offered no compromise to the demonstrators, and that tough stance was long understood to have not only Beijing\u2019s support but also its authorship. Still, the comments on Friday from Mr. Xi and other top Chinese officials, including Premier Li Keqiang, were a public reminder that Mr. Leung has Beijing\u2019s backing. The protesters\u2019 call for Mr. Leung to step down is unlikely to be met anytime soon.While the authorities have dismantled the main protest camps in Hong Kong, there are also signs that the demonstrators and their grievances will not dissipate soon. Groups have held smaller, mobile protests in the crowded commercial districts of Causeway Bay and Mong Kok in recent days.Beginning on Christmas Day in Mong Kok, the police arrested 26 men and 11 women, ranging in age from 13 and 76, who were accused of blocking roads and disturbing residents.Near the site of the main protest camp in the Admiralty district, about 50 protesters are staying in about two dozen tents near the main Hong Kong government offices, where they are closely watched by the police. The surrounding walls, which were covered during the protests with thousands of notes, posters and banners, have largely been scraped clean, however.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brighter Economy Raises Odds of Action in Congress ", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A strikingly improving labor market, coupled with broad economic growth and a falling federal budget deficit, is improving the prospects of bipartisan cooperation next year \u2014 if Republicans and Democrats can seize on easing fiscal pressures to give both sides some of their wish lists.Taken together, Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on Friday, the rapidly improving environment means policy makers no longer have to focus on near-term economic responses, which had divided Washington between Democrats who accepted worsening the deficit in the short run and Republicans who pressed for immediate cuts. \u201cAt least there will be less of a philosophical debate on infrastructure, tax reforms and expanding exports,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have that agenda because the economy is not in free fall.\u201dIn today\u2019s highly charged partisan atmosphere, of course, even good news is still filtered through a political lens. John A. Boehner, the House speaker, greeted the best payroll growth in 34 months by lamenting that \u201cmillions still remain out of work, and middle-class families across the country, including my home state of Ohio, are struggling to get by on wages that haven\u2019t kept pace with rising costs.\u201dRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, noting that Republicans controlled Washington in the years before the financial crisis, warned \u201cwe cannot go back to policies that got us into the deep ditch we were in.\u201dPresident Obama\u2019s executive action on undocumented immigrants has already inflamed partisan tensions and distrust. Dick Armey, who was House majority leader when bipartisan accords were struck in the 1990s, said President Obama would never be the negotiating partner Bill Clinton was.\u201cIf there is an ideological impediment to growth today, it\u2019s coming from the left,\u201d he said.Still, lawmakers, economists and policy analysts see in the burst of good fortune a possible easing of those tensions.\u201cI do believe there is enough common ground and common sense to go forward\u201d on a range of initiatives, on education, infrastructure and manufacturing policy, Ms. Pelosi declared on Friday.They also see lessons from the 1990s. Then, as now, a Democratic president was handily re-elected and Republicans enjoyed electoral success on Capitol Hill. After fiscal showdowns that twice shut down the government, Mr. Clinton and a Republican Congress struck a \u201cbalanced budget\u201d agreement in 1997 that cut capital gains taxes for Republicans and created the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program for Democrats \u2014 hardly austerity measures. But Washington could afford such deals with unemployment falling below 5 percent and payrolls rising an average of 284,000 a month.\u201cThere was a little bit of luck, but also a lot of pretty methodical effort,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, who was House speaker at the time. \u201cUnless you can find a way for a win-win legislative strategy in a split government, you\u2019re not going to get anything done.\u201dThat dynamic could repeat itself in the coming year. The Republican Congress will again want to pursue a balanced budget while also cutting taxes. Authorization for the federal children\u2019s health program even expires next year, but Mr. Obama has other programs on his wish list, including higher infrastructure spending. Both sides say they want to overhaul and simplify the tax code.The White House\u2019s push for fast-track trade negotiating powers \u2014 and eventually for a major Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact \u2014 could be eased by growing confidence in the economy and the nation\u2019s ability to compete internationally.Rising revenue will make that overhaul far easier, said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and chairman of the Finance Committee.\u201cNow is exactly the time to move into place the kind of permanent tax reforms that will give people certainty,\u201d he said.Improving budget numbers should also ease pressure on Congress as it deals with deep across-the-board spending cuts that will return automatically in October if nothing is done, said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, chairwoman of the Budget Committee and a Democrat.\u201cWe are in a very different fiscal situation then we were just a few years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can afford to focus not just on the deficit but in what we need to invest in to grow opportunities for the future.\u201dStill, the analogy to the 1990s can be taken only so far, warned Alec Phillips, managing director for United States economic research at Goldman Sachs. It was the president winning a sweeping re-election in 1996 that eased the path to the budget agreement of 1997. This time around, Republicans were the victors in the election, while Mr. Obama is finally in a better position to claim credit for an improving economy. But forcing mechanisms and legislative deadlines that once seemed like surefire political showdowns could prove to be useful negotiating moments, said Joel Prakken, founder of the economic forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers. On May 31, for instance, the highway trust fund is expected to hit empty. If gas prices remain this low, bipartisan proposals to raise the gas tax could become more palatable.Strong job growth could undermine arguments that a weak economy could not handle a higher federal minimum wage. And deals on long-term economic strategies become easier without the urgency of a crisis.\u201cFor a number of years, some of the most pressing economic issues were immediate, the response to recession, the recovery act,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cNow our biggest economic goal is not to stabilize the economy in the next year but to make it grow in years to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Should Own the Internet?", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsTurning Point: The top E.U. court orders Google to grant the \u201cright to be forgotten.'\u2019It is now a journalistic clich\u00e9 to remark that George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d was \u201cprophetic.\u201d The novel was so prophetic that its prophecies have become modern-day prosaisms. Reading it now is a tedious experience. Against the omniscient marvels of today\u2019s surveillance state, Big Brother\u2019s fixtures \u2014 the watchful televisions and hidden microphones \u2014 seem quaint, even reassuring.Everything about the world Orwell envisioned has become so obvious that one keeps running up against the novel\u2019s narrative shortcomings.I am more impressed with another of his oracles: the 1945 essay \u201cYou and the Atomic Bomb,\u201d in which Orwell more or less anticipates the geopolitical shape of the world for the next half-century. \u201cAges in which the dominant weapon is expensive or difficult to make,\u201d he explains, \u201cwill tend to be ages of despotism, whereas when the dominant weapon is cheap and simple, the common people have a chance ... A complex weapon makes the strong stronger, while a simple weapon \u2014 so long as there is no answer to it \u2014 gives claws to the weak.\u201dDescribing the atomic bomb (which had only two months before been used to flatten Hiroshima and Nagasaki) as an \u201cinherently tyrannical weapon,\u201d he predicts that it will concentrate power in the hands of the \u201ctwo or three monstrous super-states\u201d that have the advanced industrial and research bases necessary to produce it. Suppose, he asks, \u201cthat the surviving great nations make a tacit agreement never to use the atomic bomb against one another? Suppose they only use it, or the threat of it, against people who are unable to retaliate?\u201dThe likely result, he concludes, will be \u201can epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity.\u201d Inventing the term, he predicts \u201ca permanent state of \u2018cold war,\"\u2019 a \u201cpeace that is no peace,\u201d in which \u201cthe outlook for subject peoples and oppressed classes is still more hopeless.\u201dThere are parallels between Orwell\u2019s time and ours. For one, there has been a lot of talk about the importance of \u201cprotecting privacy\u201d in recent months, but little about why it is important. It is not, as we are asked to believe, that privacy is inherently valuable. It is not.The real reason lies in the calculus of power: the destruction of privacy widens the existing power imbalance between the ruling factions and everyone else, leaving \u201cthe outlook for subject peoples and oppressed classes,\u201d as Orwell wrote, \u201cstill more hopeless.\u201dThe second parallel is even more serious, and even less well understood. At present even those leading the charge against the surveillance state continue to treat the issue as if it were a political scandal that can be blamed on the corrupt policies of a few bad men who must be held accountable. It is widely hoped that all our societies need to do to fix our problems is to pass a few laws.The cancer is much deeper than this. We live not only in a surveillance state, but in a surveillance society. Totalitarian surveillance is not only embodied in our governments; it is embedded in our economy, in our mundane uses of technology and in our everyday interactions.The very concept of the Internet \u2014 a single, global, homogenous network that enmeshes the world \u2014 is the essence of a surveillance state. The Internet was built in a surveillance-friendly way because governments and serious players in the commercial Internet wanted it that way. There were alternatives at every step of the way. They were ignored.At their core, companies like Google and Facebook are in the same business as the U.S. government\u2019s National Security Agency. They collect a vast amount of information about people, store it, integrate it and use it to predict individual and group behavior, which they then sell to advertisers and others. This similarity made them natural partners for the NSA, and that\u2019s why they were approached to be part of PRISM, the secret Internet surveillance program.Unlike intelligence agencies, which eavesdrop on international telecommunications lines, the commercial surveillance complex lures billions of human beings with the promise of \u201cfree services.\u201d Their business model is the industrial destruction of privacy. And yet even the more strident critics of NSA surveillance do not appear to be calling for an end to Google and Facebook.Recalling Orwell\u2019s remarks, there is an undeniable \u201ctyrannical\u201d side to the Internet. But the Internet is too complex to be unequivocally categorized as a \u201ctyrannical\u201d or a \u201cdemocratic\u201d phenomenon.When people first gathered in cities, they were able to coordinate in large groups for the first time, and to exchange ideas quickly, at scale. The consequent technical and technological advances brought about the dawn of human civilization.Something similar has been happening in our epoch. It is possible for more people to communicate and trade with others in more places in a single instant than it ever has been in history. The same developments that make our civilization easier to surveil make it harder to predict. They have made it easier for the larger part of humanity to educate itself, to race to consensus, and to compete with entrenched power groups.This is encouraging, but unless it is nurtured, it may be short-lived.If there is a modern analogue to Orwell\u2019s \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cdemocratic weapon,\u201d which \u201cgives claws to the weak\u201d it is cryptography, the basis for the mathematics behind Bitcoin and the best secure communications programs. It is cheap to produce: cryptographic software can be written on a home computer. It is even cheaper to spread: software can be copied in a way that physical objects cannot. But it is also insuperable \u2014 the mathematics at the heart of modern cryptography are sound, and can withstand the might of a superpower. The same technologies that allowed the Allies to encrypt their radio communications against Axis intercepts can now be downloaded over a dial-up Internet connection and deployed with a cheap laptop.Whereas in 1945, much of the world faced a half-century of tyranny as a result of the atomic bomb, in 2015, we face the inexorable spread of invasive mass surveillance and the attendant transfer of power to those connected to its superstructures. It is too early to say whether the \u201cdemocratizing\u201d or the \u201ctyrannical\u201d side of the Internet will eventually win out. But acknowledging them \u2014 and perceiving them as the field of struggle \u2014 is the first step toward acting effectively.Humanity cannot now reject the Internet, but clearly we cannot surrender it either. Instead, we have to fight for it. Just as the dawn of atomic weapons inaugurated the Cold War, the manifold logic of the Internet is the key to understanding the approaching war for the intellectual center of our civilization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hawkish Russian Emissary to Visit Cuba\u2019s Leaders", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe emissary, Dmitri O. Rogozin, the outspoken deputy prime minister whose portfolio includes Russia\u2019s weapons and space programs, had already panned the United States\u2019 supposed change of heart toward Cuba as just a calculated change in tactics.\u201cNow they will suffocate them in their embrace,\u201d Mr. Rogozin said Thursday on Twitter during a tour through Latin America, where he was negotiating economic and weapons contracts in Brazil, Venezuela and other countries.There is little trust in the benevolence of American foreign policy in Moscow now, largely because of the perceived hand of the State Department in Ukraine\u2019s revolution in February. A well-traveled but still popular joke asks why there has not been a revolution in Washington. The answer: There is no American Embassy there.Discounting avowed hawks like Mr. Rogozin, analysts and diplomats in Moscow met Mr. Obama\u2019s decision with an approval that is rare in the current political climate, where a win for America is often seen as a loss for Russia.\u201cMy understanding is that the official reaction was neutral-positive,\u201d said Sergei A. Karaganov, a prominent Russian political scientist and dean of the School of International Economics and Foreign Affairs at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.Russia has long pushed for the United States to recognize Cuba and in taking that step, \u201cone could only applaud Mr. Obama, whether you like him or not,\u201d Mr. Karaganov added with a chuckle.But with that approval came a message that has implications for relations between the United States and Russia: Sanctions do not work.With the United States declaring its intention to isolate President Vladimir V. Putin, and Western sanctions contributing to the recent havoc in the Russian economy, it was a message that the Foreign Ministry in Moscow delivered bluntly on Thursday even as it lauded the decision on Cuba.\u201cIt is characteristic that the president of the United States admitted the lack of results of many years of attempts to \u2018isolate\u2019 Cuba,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in a 154-word statement. \u201cIt remains to hope that Washington will soon recognize the fruitlessness of the similar pressure of sanctions on other countries.\u201dThat was repeated on Russian television by anchors and pundits, who also played down concerns that Russia\u2019s influence in Latin America could be diminished by the United States.Mr. Putin wrote off $32 billion in Cuba\u2019s Soviet-era debt this year, earning good will that will pay future dividends, Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of a Russian foreign affairs journal and the head of an influential policy group, said on state television.\u201cWith the country emerging from isolation, Russia can now count on its active cooperation,\u201d Mr. Lukyanov said.Alexander Baunov, a former diplomat and world affairs columnist for the Slon news website, said that Mr. Rogozin\u2019s diplomatic writ would be to sow doubt about the United States\u2019 intentions.\u201cHis mission is to be informed,\u201d Mr. Baunov said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd he will try to convince them that they not hurry to get too close to America, because they will fool you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brave New Turkey", "Date": "2014-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorISTANBUL \u2014 Freedom House, the democracy watchdog, earlier this year downgraded the Turkish press from being \u201cpartly free\u201d to \u201cnot free.\u201d Now it may have to create a new category: \u201cnot free at all.\u201d On Sunday, Dec. 14, Turkish police raided the headquarters of Zaman, the country\u2019s most widely circulated daily, and a major television station, taking into custody at least 24 people, including the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief and the station\u2019s director. (The editor has since been released.) They were detained on suspicions of \u201cestablishing a terrorist group.\u201d But the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said the raids smacked \u201cof political vengeance.\u201dA decade ago Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then Turkey\u2019s prime minister, was the most likely candidate to lead the Islamic world. He had managed to keep Turkey out of the 2003 Iraq War, was grooming it for membership in the European Union, and was getting on with economic reform. Ordinary Turks were feeling prosperous, proud and hopeful. So why is the Turkish government now going off the rails when it has been perfectly popular doing the right things? Today Mr. Erdogan is the president, and his style is in-your-face confrontational. He is revered by enough people to get his party re-elected, but many others loathe him (remember the protests in Gezi Park?), and some of his eccentricities have made him a favorite of headline writers. Like a potentate of some Sacha Baron Cohen parody, he has had a presidential palace with over a thousand rooms built for himself. No one knows how much it cost: The government agency responsible for the construction says the sum is a state secret because its disclosure would damage the economy.The joke only goes so far. No one was chuckling during the police raids on Zaman and Samanyolu television that Sunday. Like Zaman, Samanyolu is affiliated with the self-exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whose followers have founded a network of schools, businesses and media companies. The case revolves around the allegation that the Gulen movement may have tried to discredit a small, rival religious group called Tahsiyeciler (\u201cAnnotators\u201d), by portraying it as having links to Islamic radicals \u2014 including in a political thriller series broadcast by Samanyolu. (The show\u2019s producer, director and scriptwriter were also taken into custody.)More likely, the Gulen movement\u2019s real offense was to withdraw its support for the Erdogan government last year. It may have done so in opposition to the government\u2019s attempt to broker a peace deal with rebel Kurdish groups. Or because government corruption was spiraling out of control. In any event, police officers and prosecutors loyal to Mr. Gulen are believed to have been behind a series of raids last year against senior police officers, the sons of ministers and the head of a state-owned bank, in which huge amounts of cash were seized.Many of those police officers and prosecutors have since been purged. And the government now seems determined to rule by fiat. New legislation allows the police to search premises and detain people on grounds of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d rather than concrete evidence. The authorities are clamping down on dissent, including on social media, which Mr. Erdogan once described as \u201cthe worst menace to society.\u201d Over 50,000 websites have been banned. The government blocked access to YouTube and Twitter in the run-up to local elections in March, until the Constitutional Court ruled that this violated freedom of expression and individual rights.The government remains popular enough. In nationwide local elections last March, the ruling Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., scored at least 43 percent overall, compared with 26 to 28 percent for its closest rival. In August, Mr. Erdogan won the presidential election in the first round. The A.K.P. is expected to do well in the general election scheduled to take place by June 2015. Apparently, many voters accept Mr. Erdogan\u2019s line that the Gulenists are not fighting corruption but rather trying to stage a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, or at least undermine his government.But Mr. Erdogan is playing rough with his opponents at home at the cost of Turkey\u2019s reputation abroad. His ambitions to project power in the Islamic world have already been thwarted: He had banked that Mohamed Morsi would retain power in Egypt, and before Syria erupted in civil war he had pinned his hopes on coming to an understanding with President Bashar al-Assad. Now the Turkish government risks being ostracized in Brussels as well. The European Commission declared that the wave of arrests on Dec. 14 was contrary to \u201cthe European values and standards Turkey aspires to be part of,\u201d and some are calling for the European Union to suspend entirely the already stalled negotiations over Turkey\u2019s membership.Mr. Erdogan promised his followers a \u201cNew Turkey,\u201d unfettered by the narrow ideology of the old. But he doesn\u2019t seem to believe his own rhetoric. When he first came to power in 2003, Turkey had just been devastated by an economic crisis and an old political machine powered by nepotism, favors and spoils that had run out of fuel.After vowing to do politics differently, Mr. Erdogan has brought Turkey back to its former ways. He woos voters with better transportation and health care, and he woos the close supporters who bankroll him with lucrative deals. As long as the economy expands, the wheels continue to turn. It\u2019s just that the next decade presents challenges much more complex than the last. Under A.K.P. rule, average per capita income rose from about $3,500 in 2002 to about $11,000, but that figure has been largely static for several years. To get to the next level, Turkey needs wholesale reform; it needs to reward not just party loyalty but initiative and innovation. And it can\u2019t do that by banning Twitter and raiding newspapers.Advertisement"}

But the rot goes far deeper. Long before he annexed the Crimean peninsula and began backing pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin created an economic system that allowed a coterie of insiders to grow wealthy on Russia\u2019s vast oil and gas reserves. He did little to diversify the economy or to make it more resilient.The Central Bank of Russia has tried to stem that tide by raising interest rates, which in turn slams the brakes on an already fragile economy. Some analysts believe that Moscow will soon have no choice but to impose capital controls, a move that would further isolate Russia from the rest of the global economy. The sensible thing for Mr. Putin to do would be to withdraw from Ukraine. This would bring immediate relief from sanctions, and that would ease the current crisis and give officials room to start fixing the country\u2019s economic problems.

Unemployed people have more time to exercise and cook at home, and less money to buy cigarettes or junk food. Studies in the United States and Europe over the years have found that when unemployment is high, people lose weight and become healthier and overall mortality rates drop.Yet there are signs that the most recent recession might have been different.They also do not seem to be using their free time to exercise more. About a third each said they exercised more than, less than and the same amount as when they were employed. But 57 percent said they spent more time doing sedentary activities like reading, watching TV and surfing the web. Fifteen percent said they spent less time doing those things.Because the recovery has not brought significant numbers of new jobs, people may have settled into less healthy behaviors because they assume they will not work again soon, they found.Unlike other studies on health and unemployment, this one used longitudinal data, tracking the same people over time. They found that a small increase in exercise, a moderate decrease in smoking and a decline in the purchasing of fast food were offset by a substantial decline in total physical activity. The net result was slight weight gain.There was significant variation within the data. For example, though smoking decreased over all, it increased for some people, probably because of the stress of unemployment or because many workplaces ban smoking, so people do it more when they are home, they said.And although fast food consumption declined, it did not necessarily mean people were eating better. People spend more time cooking when the unemployment rate is high, according to data from the American Time Use Survey, but they might also resort to less-balanced diets or more cheap, sugary snacks.Unemployed people are also more likely to delay going to the doctor, the economists found.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Vacation Over?", "Date": "2014-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than we may realize, the world has been riding a lucky streak since the global financial meltdown in 2008. How so? The years between 2008 and late 2013 were \u2014 relatively speaking \u2014 a rather benign period of big power politics and geopolitics. This allowed the major economic powers \u2014 the United States, the European Union, China, India, Russia, Brazil and Japan \u2014 to focus almost exclusively on economic rehabilitation. But now there are strong indications that our vacation from geo-instability is over. The last time the world witnessed such a steep and sustained drop in oil prices \u2014 from 1986 to 1999 \u2014 it had some profound political consequences for oil-dependent states and those who depended on their largess. The Soviet empire collapsed; Iran elected a reformist president; Iraq invaded Kuwait; and Yasir Arafat, having lost his Soviet backer and Arab bankers, recognized Israel \u2014 to name but a few. Admittedly, other factors were involved in all these events. But, in each case, steep drops in direct or indirect oil revenues played a big role. If today\u2019s falloff in oil prices is sustained, we\u2019ll also be in for a lot of surprises. Some will have happy endings. Cuba\u2019s decision to bury the hatchet with America had to have been spurred in part by Havana\u2019s fears of losing some or all of the 100,000 barrels of subsidized oil a day it gets from the now cash-strapped Venezuela. Others could be very destabilizing. Today\u2019s world is much more tightly interconnected and interdependent than in the last oil price drop-off, which was before the spread of the Internet. And today\u2019s world has so many more actors \u2014 superpowers and superempowered individuals and hackers who can destabilize companies and countries with cyberweapons. See dictionary for \u201cSony\u201d and \u201cNorth Korea.\u201d The Western sanctions on Putin\u2019s banks, combined with the sudden sharp drop in oil prices and capital flight also triggered by the sanctions, mean that Russia has a dangerous gap between the funds flowing into its economy and what it needs to send out to pay its debts and finance its imports. Putin can\u2019t relieve the pressure without a lifting of Western sanctions. That would require him to reverse his seizure of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine.If Putin admits his Ukraine adventure was a mistake, he will look incredibly foolish and the long knives will be out for him in the Kremlin. If he doesn\u2019t back down, Russians will pay a huge price. Either way, that system will be stressed with unpredictable spillovers on the global economy. Remember: Russia\u2019s 1998 economic collapse \u2014 also triggered by low oil prices and the moratorium it declared on payments to foreign debtors \u2014 helped to sink the giant American hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, sparking a near meltdown on Wall Street.A prolonged drop in oil prices will impact Algeria, Iran and Arab Gulf states, where aging regimes have used high oil prices to increase government salaries to buy quiet from their people during the Arab Spring. Also, in an age when machines and software are ensuring that average is over for workers in developed countries, and everyone needs to be upgrading their skills, what happens to the developing Arab states and Iran, who have used oil money to mask their deficits in knowledge, education and women\u2019s empowerment? Egypt\u2019s military-led government is highly in need of Arab oil money to get through its crisis. A bit of good news: The Islamic State, which depends on oil smuggling, will fail at governing even faster than it already has.High oil prices covered many sins and fostered many sins. If they stay low again for long, a lot of leaders will have to pay retail for their crazy politics, not wholesale. The political and geopolitical fallouts will be varied \u2014 good and bad \u2014 but fallout aplenty there will be. Advertisement"}

In the months that followed, the girl showed no sign that she intended to head for Syria or Iraq. She took off her veil to go to school, as French law requires, and she spent her days close to her mother.Then in October, she disappeared. The surveillance cameras in the Mulhouse airport, 50 miles from her home, showed her moving confidently and alone as she used her older sister\u2019s passport to fly to Istanbul and then on to Gaziantep, a Turkish city known as the gateway to Syria for jihadists.Another 15-year-old girl, who was intercepted by French intelligence officers as she tried to go to Syria months ago, has since told the authorities that once her recruiters realized that she was unlikely to be able to leave the country anytime soon, they began pressing her to strike at home against Jews. She told them she had begun looking for weapons and targets.So far, teenage girls hoping to join the jihadists\u2019 cause have been identified in a half dozen countries in Europe, and include three youths traveling from America and arrested in Germany.But experts say that the problem appears most severe in France, which has a large Muslim population from the Middle East and North Africa and where more than a hundred families have been talking to experts to help them cope with their daughters\u2019 growing radicalization.Jihadists have been masterful at recruiting adolescents on the Internet, experts say, reaching them first through exchanges over hair, makeup or even something as banal as the best chocolate bar, before drawing them into political discussions. They then show the girls heartbreaking videos of violence against Muslims \u2014 eventually targeting them with offers of marriage or the chance to do humanitarian work in support of an ideal, religious society.In Bethoncourt, where unemployment is more than 24 percent, Souka\u00efna lived in a relatively isolated area of low-income housing projects. Her neighborhood has only a small strip mall with two cafes frequented only by men. Many of the older Arab women do not speak much French and rarely leave their homes.Friends say Souka\u00efna\u2019s parents understand little about the Internet, and even after her parents started watching her more closely, she clearly continued to plan her departure carefully. She went online at an Internet cafe shortly before taking a taxi to the airport. On the day of her departure, she told her parents that she would eat lunch at school and spend the night with a friend afterward.\u201cShe succeeded in putting everyone around her to sleep, even those who were closest to her,\u201d said Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Brunisso, the local prosecutor.Her departure has left many in this struggling town stunned, questioning how they could have been so blind to what was happening to a timid, quiet young woman who liked to braid her friends\u2019 hair and draw ornate henna tattoos on their hands.\u201cYou see these things on television and you say, \u2018Well, that could never happen here,\u2019 \u201d said Samia Messaoudi, a longtime family friend. \u201cThe parents who lived with her every day did not feel this coming. I know this girl very well, I go to that house all the time. I never would have believed it possible.\u201dAs with the young men who are leaving Europe to join the jihadists, the young women seem driven in part by the difficulties of assimilating to a culture that many consider hostile to their religion and an economy that offers them little hope of a better life.Once this small town thrived. But many of the Muslim families that came here decades ago to work in a nearby Peugeot factory lost those jobs to mechanization and never found other work.The town, which has shrunk from a population of 11,000 to 6,000, is sharply divided \u2014 with a middle class, largely white population on one side of the railroad tracks and a largely poor Muslim one on the other.\u201cEverything was nice here until the 1990s,\u201d said Jean Andr\u00e9, the mayor, who blames the fact that there is little to do in the housing projects for the restlessness of the town\u2019s youth. \u201cWhen they built them, they forgot that human beings would be living there. There is no cinema there, no entertainment. There is nothing for them there.\u201dAfter the news of Souka\u00efna\u2019s disappearance, Mr. Andr\u00e9 sought out her mother and went to visit her. \u201cIt is hard to see such distress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe phone rings and she runs thinking it is her daughter. But it is not.\u201dMs. Bouzar said the girl had been encouraged to isolate herself from her friends and family. She was also bombarded with Internet messages and phone calls from people about the atrocities in Syria, and shown videos of babies gassed by the government forces.In the magazine L\u2019Obs, the girl was quoted saying: \u201cLittle by little I stopped talking to people. I stayed in my room with the shutters closed. And I signed on to the Internet.\u201dSasha Havlicek, the chief executive of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a British research organization, said much of the recruiting glorified the role of women as supporters.One friend of Souka\u00efna\u2019s reached through Facebook said she suspected that the recruiters had been able to tap into the resentment that some Muslims feel in France, which has, for instance, put restrictions on women wearing veils.\u201cThe fact that we can\u2019t live our religion the way we would like in France might have been a factor,\u201d said the friend. \u201cThe people who manipulated her probably kept pressing that point, offering her a better life.One adolescent from France, Nora, quickly contacted her family from Syria saying she wanted to come home. Her brother, Fouad, traveled to Syria to get her but was not allowed to bring her home. He said his sister, deeply upset, had ended up babysitting for the children of jihadists.Ms. Messaoudi said Souka\u00efna\u2019s parents were still holding out hope that she simply ran off with friends. Teenagers, Ms. Messaoudi said, were so difficult to understand.\u201cWhat they say to you,\u201d she said, \u201cis different than what they say to their friends. You never know every facet of a teenager.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a 15-year-old French girl who the authorities believe joined jihadists in Syria after being lured by Islamist websites that try to recruit adolescent girls misstated the timing of her disappearance. She left her hometown of Bethoncourt in October, not \u201clast month.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Hints on Pricing Offer Warning for Oil Companies", "Date": "2014-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 The 40 percent plunge in oil prices since July, when Brent crude peaked at $115 a barrel, is almost certainly good news for the world economy; but it is surely a crippling blow for oil producers.Oil prices below $70 spell trouble for American and Canadian shale and tar-sand oil producers and also for oil-exporting countries like Mexico, Nigeria, Russia and Venezuela, which depend on inflated oil revenues to finance government spending or pay foreign debts. On the other hand, the implications of lower oil prices for the biggest American and European oil companies are more ambiguous and could even be positive.The shareholders of major oil companies like BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Total could be among the biggest beneficiaries of the price slump if it forces their management to abandon some of the bad habits they acquired in the 40-year oil boom that started when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries established itself as an effective cartel in January 1974. If this period of cartelized monopoly pricing is ending, as Saudi Arabia has strongly hinted in the past few weeks, then it is time to refocus on some basic principles of resource economics that big oil companies have ignored for decades, to their shareholders\u2019 enormous cost. The most important of these principles is diminishing returns: The more oil corporate geologists discover, the lower the returns their shareholders can hope to achieve, because new reserves will almost invariably be more expensive to develop than the ones discovered earlier that were, almost by definition, more accessible. This inherent flaw in the oil companies\u2019 business model was disguised for the past 40 years by the fact that oil prices rose faster than the costs of exploration and production. But this is where a second economic principle now starts to bite. Unless a market is totally dominated by a monopoly, prices will be set by the most efficient supplier\u2019s marginal costs of production \u2014 in layman\u2019s terms, by the cost of producing an extra barrel from oil reserves that have already been discovered and developed. In a fully competitive market, the enormous sums of money invested in exploring new oil fields could not be recovered until all lower-cost reserves ran dry, and there would be no point in exploring anywhere outside the Middle Eastern and Central Asian oil fields, where the oil is easiest to pump. That is, of course, an oversimplification. In the real world of geopolitical conflicts, and transport and infrastructure constraints, consumers want energy security and will pay premium prices for supplies from their own oil fields or from those that belong to trusted allies. Nevertheless, the broad principle applies: The vast sums spent on exploring and developing new reserves with production costs much higher than those in Middle East oil fields will never be recovered if the oil market becomes even vaguely competitive. Considering that Western companies spend about $450 billion annually on exploration and development, according to an Ernst & Young oil reserves study, this could be one of the worst capital misallocations in history. The fact is, Western producers can never match the costs of oil pumped by Saudi Aramco, or even Rosneft of Russia or other state-owned companies with exclusive access to the world\u2019s most accessible reserves. While Exxon Mobil or BP must spend billions drilling through Arctic ice caps or exploring five miles under the Gulf of Mexico, the Saudis can pump oil from their deserts with machines not much more expensive than old-fashioned \u201cnodding donkeys.\u201d In a competitive market, the rational strategy for Western oil companies would be stop all exploration, while continuing to provide technology, geology and other profitable oil field services to the nationalized owners of readily accessible reserves. The vast amounts of cash generated by selling oil from existing low-cost reserves already developed could then be distributed to shareholders until these low-cost oil fields ran dry. This strategy of self-liquidation could be described euphemistically as \u201crunning the business for cash\u201d in the same way as tobacco companies or closed insurance funds. There are two reasons this has not happened thus far. First, OPEC has sheltered Western oil companies from diminishing returns and marginal-cost pricing by keeping prices artificially high through output restraint and limited expansion of cheap Middle Eastern oil fields (strictures reinforced by wars and sanctions in Iraq and Iran). Second, oil companies have believed with quasi-religious fervor in perpetually rising oil demand. Therefore, finding new reserves seemed more important than maximizing cash distributions to shareholders. The second assumption could soon be overturned, as suggested by rumors of a takeover bid for BP. If private equity investors could raise the $160 billion needed to buy BP, they could liquidate for cash a company whose proven reserves of 10.05 billion barrels would be worth $350 billion even after an additional 50 percent price decline. But what of the first condition? The Saudis would surely want to stabilize prices at some point by limiting production, but the target prices may now be considerably lower than previously assumed. The Saudis seem to have realized that by ceding market share to other producers, they risk allowing much of their oil to become a worthless \u201cstranded asset\u201d that can never be sold or burned. With the global atmosphere approaching its carbon limits and technological progress gradually reducing the price of nonfossil fuels, the Bank of England warned this week that some of the world\u2019s oil reserves could be left with no market value despite the huge sums sunk into the ground by oil companies, their shareholders and banks.The Saudis are well aware of this risk. Back in the 1970s, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi oil minister, used to warn his compatriots not to rely forever on selling oil: The Stone Age didn\u2019t end because the cave men ran out of stones. Maybe the end of the \u201cOil Age\u201d is now approaching, and the Saudis have understood this better than Western oilmen. Advertisement"}

In my opinion, Gov. Andrew M.

The Cuomo administration\u2019s opinion that fracking is not as safe as it should be, and that science needs more time to produce a secure way to extract natural gas through fracking, is backed by experts and is a reasonable position.It is easy for Mr. Nocera to say that \u201cvery little in life is completely safe,\u201d but that is small comfort to those who live close to a fracking operation.The fracking industry has been its own worst enemy in its rush to extract gas as fast and as cheaply as it can.

{"Headline": "Health Spending Rises Only Modestly ", "Date": "2014-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Spending on health care in the United States grew in 2013 at the lowest rate since the federal government began tracking it in 1960, the Obama administration said Wednesday.It was the fifth straight year of exceptionally small increases in the closely watched indicator. The data defied critics who had said such slow growth would not continue for long once the recession ended in mid-2009.Health spending totaled $2.9 trillion last year, up 3.6 percent from 2012, the administration said. The share of the economy devoted to health care, which appeared to be growing inexorably for decades, has been the same since 2009.Spending for health care in 2013 averaged $9,255 a person, government economists and statisticians reported. Health spending grew at about the same pace as the economy and accounted for 17.4 percent of the gross domestic product, which reflects the total output of goods and services.Among factors restraining the growth of health spending, the administration pointed to new limits on Medicare payments to hospitals and health maintenance organizations; automatic across-the-board cuts in federal spending required by a 2011 law; and the proliferation of high-deductible health insurance plans, which tend to discourage the use of care by requiring consumers to pay more of the cost.Faster growth in Medicaid spending offset some of the slowdown in spending by Medicare and private insurance in 2013, officials said. The 2013 figures did not show the effects of major expansions in coverage that took effect this year.Moreover, the data did not answer a question hotly debated by health policy experts and economists: whether the recent slowdown in health spending was attributable to aftereffects of the recession or to cost-control features of the Affordable Care Act, signed by President Obama in 2010. The civil servants who wrote the report said some provisions of the law \u201cexerted downward pressure\u201d on health spending while others \u201cexerted upward pressure.\u201d\u201cThe key question is whether health spending growth will accelerate once economic conditions improve significantly,\u201d the report said. \u201cHistorical evidence suggests that it will.\u201dMarilyn B. Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the report was \u201canother piece of evidence that our efforts to reform the health care delivery system are working.\u201dRetail sales of prescription drugs totaled $271 billion last year, accounting for 9.3 percent of all health spending. This proportion has not increased substantially in recent years, but it results from two divergent trends: an increase in the use of high-cost specialty drugs and greater use of low-cost generic medicines.A year after it was fully in place, the Affordable Care Act has largely succeeded in delivering on President Obama\u2019s main promises, even as it fell short in some ways and gave birth to a new and powerful conservative movement.\u201cHigher prices for specialty drugs were due in part to expensive new medicines \u2014 in particular, those used to treat multiple sclerosis and cancer \u2014 as well as more rapid price increases for existing specialty drugs,\u201d Mr. Hartman said. \u201cAlthough specialty drugs accounted for less than 1 percent of prescriptions dispensed, they represented almost 28 percent of total pharmacy-related prescription drug spending in 2013.\u201dAt the same time, the report said, the share of prescriptions filled with generic drugs climbed to 80 percent in 2013, up from 73 percent in 2011.Under the Affordable Care Act, federal and state officials review insurance rates to identify \u201cunreasonable increases in premiums,\u201d and the government requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premium revenue on medical care and quality improvement activities. These provisions helped hold down health spending, the report said.The government reported lower use of inpatient and outpatient hospital services in 2013, coinciding with requirements for patients to share more of the cost under some types of insurance.For example, the report said, \u201cthe average patient cost-sharing charge per day increased 19.5 percent in 2013, while the average cost-sharing for an outpatient surgery episode increased by 10 percent.\u201dOver all, the report said, medical prices increased just 1.3 percent in 2013, slightly less than prices in the general economy. Prices for doctors\u2019 services increased less than one-tenth of 1 percent, the smallest change since 2002, and prices for home health care services declined. While Medicare spending for doctors\u2019 services increased 2.5 percent last year, Medicaid payments to doctors increased 14.9 percent, mainly because of a temporary increase in payment rates for primary care doctors treating Medicaid beneficiaries.Medicare, for older Americans and people with disabilities, and Medicaid, for low-income people, accounted for more than one-third of all health spending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plan Outlines Low-Carbon Future for Germany", "Date": "2014-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBusiness of GreenAMSTERDAM \u2014 Scientists have developed a comprehensive computer model that simulates German energy supply and demand, in a bid to establish whether it is feasible for Germany to rely on renewable energy sources to power its economy and meet its carbon dioxide emission reduction targets.Developed by Hans-Martin Henning and Andreas Palzer, two physicists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, in Freiburg, the Renewable Energy Model-Deutschland, or REMod-D, is a computer simulation that models an all-sector future energy system for Germany, matching supply and demand on an hourly basis over a full year.Using real data from 2011 and 2012, the researchers have run millions of simulations to optimize the model. They say they have demonstrated that there are several economically viable ways to achieve a low-carbon future, using existing technologies.\u201cWe wanted to answer the question: Is it possible for Germany to meet its ambitious CO2 reduction target using predominantly renewable energies?\u201d Mr. Henning said in an interview. \u201cAnd, if yes, what is the composition of this system, and what is its cost?\u201dThe answer to the first question is an unequivocal \u201cyes,\u201d according to Eicke Weber, the institute\u2019s director and a professor of physics at Freiburg University.\u201cIt is economically to our advantage to move as quickly as possible to a system of 80 percent renewable energy,\u201d Professor Weber said during an interview.\u201cOur researchers have shown that the cost of this transformation of the entire energy system \u2014 not just electricity \u2014 would be the same as today\u2019s system to run; but the needed investments would cost less than what would be saved by spending far less on fossil fuels,\u201d Professor Weber said.\u201cOur estimate is that the changeover will cost about 500 billion euros,\u201d or about $628 billion, he said. \u201cHowever, between now and 2050 we will realize savings of between \u20ac600 billion and \u20ac1,000 billion. These are savings on the total energy system, including fossil fuels and the distribution system.\u201d\u201cTo go beyond 80 percent would cost a lot more,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the low-hanging fruit is to start with an 80 percent renewable energy system. The faster you add renewable energy to the grid, the faster you reach the crossover point where the savings become greater than the costs. We estimate that Germany could reach that point as soon as 2025.\u201dThe simulations show that switching to a low carbon economy can be done without damaging businesses or living standards, Mr. Henning said.\u201cWe set as a baseline condition of our model that CO2 emissions could not exceed Germany\u2019s ambitious CO2 reduction target for 2050,\u201d he said. \u201cGermany is committed to reducing its CO2 emissions by at least 80 percent below 1990 levels by then.\u201d\u201cAnother baseline condition was that Germany would not be economically harmed by our results,\u201d Mr. Henning added. \u201cIndustry would become more efficient but would remain strong. There would be no decrease in the standard of living, in comfort levels or in mobility.\u201d\u201cEverything is included in this model, starting from electricity generation, storage and end-use electricity, all the fuel sectors including biomass and also hydrogen production and even methane from power-to-gas technologies,\u201d Mr. Henning said. \u201cFor mobility, electric vehicles, hydrogen-powered vehicles, and also fuel-powered vehicles are part of the model.\u201d\u201cWe think that this is probably the first model that is really able to appropriately treat this challenge of a highly complex system with many interdependencies and many components,\u201d he said.Prof. Manfred Fischedick, vice president at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy, said the model was an important contribution to discussions about renewable energy. \u201cThere are not many studies available trying to investigate what a renewable energy-based system would look like,\u201d Professor Fischedick said. \u201cThis model distinguishes itself by its level of technological detail and its comprehensive coverage of the relevant interactions in the system.\u201dEnergy efficiency in buildings is an important variable in the model \u2014 the more buildings are retrofitted to save on heat and power, the less solar and wind generating capacity needs to be installed. Another variable is the balance between renewable energies, conventional power plants and gas-fueled combined heat and power, or C.H.P., plants.As an example of one scenario produced by the model, based on existing technologies and conservative projections of future cost trends for renewables, Mr. Henning cited an energy system incorporating a 40 percent reduction from current levels in building heating requirements.Taking into account the baseline requirement for reduced carbon emissions \u2014 implying a large-scale closure of conventional thermal power plants and a switch away from gasoline and diesel-powered cars \u2014 \u201cwe would need 150 gigawatts of photovoltaics, about 120 gigawatts of onshore wind, about 30 gigawatts of offshore wind, and an electric capacity of 60 gigawatts of C.H.P. that would supply all the residual electricity needs of the system,\u201d he said.Germany currently has 35 gigawatts of installed photovoltaic generation and 30 gigawatts of onshore wind.In this scenario, offshore wind capacity would be limited for environmental reasons, he said, while the electricity system would incorporate substantial storage capacity to handle the fluctuations of supply and demand. This could take the form of about eight million batteries connected to home photovoltaic systems and a doubling of current pumped storage capacity. Heat storage would be split among about 150 large-scale centralized storage plants and about seven million home storage units.Finally, about 33 gigawatts of electrolytic plants would produce hydrogen or methane fuel for transportation.\u201cAltogether, this system uses 78 percent renewable energy,\u201d Mr. Henning said, \u201cand has a much higher overall efficiency than today\u2019s system.\u201dEfficiency improvements would come from retrofitting insulation in buildings to cut heat loss; closing thermal power plants, \u201cwhich produce lots of waste heat\u201d; and switching a large part of the auto fleet to renewable energy, \u201ceither directly with batteries, or indirectly by using hydrogen or methane generated by renewable electricity,\u201d he said.Contrary to popular fears, Mr. Henning said, \u201cthere are many hours when renewables are not sufficient to meet demand, but even more hours when we have too much renewable energy.\u201dThis system, after installation, would have running costs very close to the present system\u2019s running costs of about 260 billion euros, or about $326 billion, per year, Mr. Henning and Mr. Palzer said.According to their calculations, the cumulative investment over the next 35 years for all major renewable energy sources required by this system would amount to \u20ac470 billion. But this would save \u20ac660 billion in avoided fuel costs, at constant fossil fuel prices. If fossil fuel prices rose by 1 percent per year during this period, then the avoided fuel cost would be \u20ac830 billion.

That has allowed them to become more fully integrated into the global economy and helped millions of their citizens escape poverty over the last generation without bloodshed or revolution.How might that strategy of gradualism play out in Cuba?Mr. Hufbauer and Ms. Kotschwar envision liberalization proceeding step by step, with each step matched by greater integration in the American-led economic and political system.For example, they write, if the United States allows Americans to freely travel to Cuba for tourism (a step that the Obama administration stopped short of in the series of steps toward liberalization announced Wednesday), Cuba should commit to allowing American hotel chains to operate on equal footing with Cuban and European-owned resorts.Or if the United States allows Cuba to join the International Monetary Fund, Cuba should commit to complying over time with the trade liberalization rules of the World Trade Organization.And to the degree Cuban firms are allowed to export cigars and other goods to the United States, American firms should be granted freedom to invest in Cuba on terms comparable to that of other international ventures.For two countries that have barely talked to each other for nearly three generations, there is a long way to go to build the kind of trust that the United States enjoys with most of its neighbors. The approach that Mr. Hufbauer and Ms. Kotschwar (who were both traveling Wednesday and thus unavailable to be interviewed) outline a way to build that trust step by step. One imagines the negotiations that led to the new thaw, which reportedly took place in Canada and at the Vatican, being first steps toward that kind of mutual back-and-forth you see in normal diplomatic and trade relationships.One thing is for sure, though. Given how hostile United States relations with Russia are more than two decades after the fall of the Soviet Union, Americans have a strong rooting interest in avoiding a Putin-like leader of Cuba 90 miles from its shores.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Slowdown in China Bruises Economy in Latin America", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneSANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 Few people are as intensely worried about the slowing Chinese economy as Latin Americans.Not only does China buy nearly 40 percent of Chile\u2019s copper, but its once-insatiable demand helped push copper prices from $1 to $4 a pound.Meanwhile, Beijing plowed billions into Peruvian mines and fisheries and spent billions more buying soybeans from Argentina and Brazil. And it propped up the Venezuelan government to the tune of $50 billion in loans, to be paid in shipments of oil.China\u2019s voracious hunger for Latin America\u2019s raw materials fueled the region\u2019s most prosperous decade since the 1970s. It filled government coffers and helped halve the region\u2019s poverty rate.That era is over. For policy makers gathered here last week for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s conference on challenges to Latin America\u2019s prosperity, there seemed to be no more clear and present danger than China\u2019s slowdown.\u201cThe commodity boom allowed governments and companies to avoid hard choices,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Velasco, Chile\u2019s finance minister from 2006 to 2010, told me. \u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake even Argentina grew by 5 to 6 percent per year for almost a decade.\u201dCopper is back under $3. As commodity prices continue to swoon, driven in large part by China\u2019s weaker demand, the going will get much tougher.That\u2019s especially true of the major oil exporters, clobbered by a collapse in oil prices driven by faltering global demand and increased supplies from the United States and elsewhere.But the commodity decline isn\u2019t sparing many. \u201cGrowth in Latin America should move back to pre-commodity boom rates,\u201d said Alejandro Werner, who leads the Western hemisphere division at the I.M.F. Indeed, the fund expects the region to grow barely 1.3 percent in 2014, a third of its pace just three years ago.The bust underlines how Latin American economies have failed to overcome the existential weakness that has plagued them throughout history: a dependence on raw materials that has shackled the region\u2019s development to an incessant sequence of booms and busts.From Brazil and Argentina in the southern tip of the region to Mexico in the north, officials across Latin America fretted for years that China undermined their decades-long efforts to build the manufacturing industries that, they hoped, would provide a ticket into the developed world.Not only did China\u2019s cheap labor outcompete Latin American industry and draw the lion\u2019s share of global manufacturing investment, but its appetite for Latin America\u2019s minerals, oil and agricultural products also raised the value of currencies around the region, making their manufactured goods even less competitive.Manufacturing\u2019s share in Latin America\u2019s economic output has declined steadily for more than a decade, ever since China inserted itself aggressively into the global economy by entering the World Trade Organization.At the same time, the share of raw materials in Latin America\u2019s exports, which had fallen to a low of 27 percent in the late 1990s, from about 52 percent in the early 1980s, surged back to more than 50 percent on the eve of the global financial crisis.Mr. Velasco, 54, recalled when a 23-year-old student in Antofagasta asked him what the Chilean government would do with the nation\u2019s copper riches. By the time the student was his age, Mr. Velasco responded, Chile would have no more copper.\u201cThe question,\u201d he said, \u201cisn\u2019t what should we do with copper but what will we do without it.\u201dChina\u2019s diplomats emphasize that it is a developing country, not an advanced, \u201cimperialist\u201d power like the United States or the European colonial powers who ruled for centuries and served as the first foreign exploiters of Latin America\u2019s mineral wealth. To many in Latin America, the difference hardly seems relevant.Take San Juan de Marcona, a remote village on the edge of the Pacific Ocean in the Nazca region of Peru. Built in the 1950s to house workers at the vast open-top American-owned iron mine, the town no longer houses managers from the United States. In the 1970s, General Juan Velasco Alvarado, then Peru\u2019s military dictator, pushed them out.Today, Marcona\u2019s managers come from Shougang, of China, which bought it from the Peruvian government in the 1990s.\u201cA growing China was very important to bring Peru along in the last 10 years,\u201d said Cynthia Sanborn, who leads the Research Center at the Universidad del Pac\u00edfico in Lima.North of Marcona, Chinalco built a town to relocate 5,000 inhabitants of Morococha, where it will blast open a copper mine. This year, China\u2019s MMG, Guoxin International Investment and Citic Metal bought the Las Bambas copper mine from the Anglo-Swiss conglomerate Glencore.Chinese companies are interested not only in raw materials but also in vast public works to transport the raw materials, including rail links across Brazil and a proposed $50 billion, 171-mile canal across Nicaragua.In 2010, Chinese lending to Latin America roughly equaled that of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the United States Ex-Im Bank combined. (It has since slowed.) Carmen Reinhart of Harvard forecasts that China could become Latin America\u2019s main source of financing.Perhaps Latin America should just count its blessings. \u201cThe concerns of dependency are there, but if China weren\u2019t there, Peru would be seeking other markets for its minerals,\u201d Ms. Sanborn told me.Mr. Werner of the I.M.F. argues that the case for deindustrialization is overblown. \u201cFrom a medium-term perspective, China is a plus, plus, plus for Latin America,\u201d he said.In agriculture, for instance, exports to China are leading to lots of innovation and efficiency improvements. Demand for Brazil and Argentina\u2019s soy \u2014 a principal source of animal feed \u2014 is unlikely to wane as the Chinese become richer and eat more meat.\u201cDon\u2019t bet against nature,\u201d Mr. Werner urged policy makers in the region. \u201cPlay to your comparative advantage.\u201dIn some of the region, however, China has inspired a nostalgic reinterpretation of its economic history and a re-examination of the policy choices of its past.Remember Dependency Theory?The doctrine, which spread across Latin America from the 1950s through the 1970s, proposed that the region, or any developing country, could never advance simply by selling natural resources to the rich North, using the money to import the North\u2019s industrial goods. Import substitution, behind a wall of trade barriers, was the path to prosperity.The theory fell into disrepute during Latin America\u2019s \u201clost decade\u201d of the 1980s \u2014 blamed by a new crop of market-oriented, United States-trained leaders in the 1990s for turning the region into an uncompetitive backwater.Courtesy of China, it\u2019s back, fine-tuned to adapt to a more integrated global economy.She suggests that China should still be invited to participate in Latin America\u2019s development, but on different terms: \u201cYou want our commodities? O.K. But also invest in solar panels here,\u201d she proposed.Yet for all the hopes in Latin America that a new kind of deal can be had, the symbiotic relationship between the largest importer of commodities and one of the biggest commodity-exporting regions of the world is unlikely to change in any substantial way.\u201cWithout this complementarity, the Chinese don\u2019t have much to go on,\u201d said Matt Ferchen, who runs the China and the Developing World program at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s working out quite well for China.\u201dAnd the symbiosis could survive for a long time. As Huang Haizhou, the managing director of the China International Capital Corporation, told the nervous Latin Americans at the I.M.F.\u2019s conference here, despite any slowdown in growth, China\u2019s long-term demand for commodities remained voracious.China\u2019s income per person is still only about one-third that of Chile. Every year for the next 30 years, it plans to move 1.3 percent of its population from the countryside to cities. That will require a lot of construction.\u201cChina\u2019s demand for commodities is more important for Latin American growth than exports to the United States,\u201d Mr. Huang said, \u201cand it will be more important for many years to come.\u201dThis may come as a relief to the worried finance ministers here, struggling to recrunch their budgets to fit lower growth and scarcer tax revenue. But it also poses a challenge to the region\u2019s leaders: maybe the traditional development strategy based on manufacturing needs to be recast in Latin America for a new era.The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about the effect of China\u2019s slowdown on Latin American economies, misspelled the surname of a Harvard professor who has studied that economic relationship. She is Carmen Reinhart, not Reinhardt. Because of an editing error, the column also misattributed a quotation. It was Cynthia Sanborn, who leads the Research Center at the Universidad del Pac\u00edfico in Lima \u2014 not an unspecified \u201che\u201d \u2014 who said, \u201cThe concerns of dependency are there, but if China weren\u2019t there, Peru would be seeking other markets for its minerals.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Even Loyalty No Guarantee Against Putin", "Date": "2014-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPutin's WayMOSCOW \u2014 Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov, not long ago one of Russia\u2019s richest men, walked free on Dec. 17 after 92 days under house arrest. He was held by prosecutors on charges of laundering money from the purchase of an oil company in 2009 \u2014 charges that President Vladimir V. Putin ultimately acknowledged could not be substantiated. By then, the legal case against him had stripped him of his shares of the oil company, Bashneft, and returned them to the property of the state. In a matter of months, his legal odyssey drained as much as 90 percent of Mr. Yevtushenkov\u2019s fortune, leaving him scrambling to salvage what he could of companies and subsidiaries that trade on the London and New York stock exchanges. The swift, unexpected and still largely unexplained expropriation of Bashneft is the latest case to highlight the darker corners of the political and economic system that Mr. Putin has developed during his 15 years as Russia\u2019s paramount leader. Mr. Yevtushenkov has now joined a list that includes not only Putin critics like the exiled former oil executive Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who spent 10 years in prison before being freed by Mr. Putin, and Aleksei A. Navalny, the lawyer and businessman turned anticorruption crusader who, after final arguments in the latest criminal case against him, now faces the prospect of a similarly lengthy term behind bars. They also include others who, like Mr. Yevtushenkov, once expected that outward loyalty and close ties to the Kremlin afforded them a measure of protection. A prominent businessman who knows Mr. Yevtushenkov said that Mr. Putin had eroded the very notion of property rights in Russia, even for those who displayed fealty. He said that Mr. Putin himself had described private ownership of strategic industries with the Russian word to roost. \u201cA chicken can exercise ownership of eggs, and it can get fed while it\u2019s sitting on the egg,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not really their egg.\u201dThe case against Mr. Yevtushenkov and the oil company unfolded in the wake of the international furor over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in March. It continued despite the economic turmoil that has hit the country following the imposition of sanctions by the United States and its Western allies and the drop in the price of oil. According to analysts, investors, businessmen and employees of Mr. Yevtushenkov\u2019s holding company, Sistema, the seizure of Bashneft was both a reaction to the economic tumult and a factor in worsening it. They said that Bashneft fell victim to the rapacious ambitions of the state oil company, Rosneft, which is controlled by one of Mr. Putin\u2019s oldest and closest aides, Igor I. Sechin. Mr. Sechin was instrumental in the legal assault against Mr. Khodorkovsky that began in 2003 and ended with Rosneft\u2019s acquisition of the tycoon\u2019s oil company, Yukos, and Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s conviction on fraud and embezzlement charges in what were widely denounced as show trials.Others attributed the case to an internal power struggle among Mr. Putin\u2019s circle of advisers, while still others pointed to Mr. Yevtushenkov\u2019s activities in Ukraine after the ouster of the president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. Mr. Yevtushenkov\u2019s legal troubles served as an ominous warning to the country\u2019s businessmen to remain loyal and pliant in what appears to be a new era of sanctions and economic hardship. \u201cThe people in the Kremlin certainly would understand that it was going to hurt the stock market; that it\u2019s going to add to the whole economic situation; that it was going to frighten the business community,\u201d Mr. Lebedev said. They went ahead anyway, he added, because they wanted to deliver a message: \u201cBehave yourself.\u201dThe State Trumps CapitalismThe history of Bashneft since the collapse of the Soviet Union has reflected the uncertain and ultimately incomplete transition to a market economy, and its demise punctuated the steady accretion of state control in strategic industries that has become the most prominent feature of Mr. Putin\u2019s rule.Once part of the Soviet oil ministry, the company and its oil fields were transferred by the government of President Boris N. Yeltsin to the regional government where they were located in the Republic of Bashkortostan, an ethnically diverse region between the Volga River and the Urals. Mr. Yeltsin famously urged Russia\u2019s regions and republics to \u201cswallow\u201d as much autonomy as they could. Mr. Putin, though, has steadily eroded the independent authority of the regions. Bashkortostan was ruled as a fief by Murtaza G. Rakhimov, a powerful political ally of Mr. Yeltsin\u2019s whose relations with Mr. Putin would become increasingly strained. In 2002 and 2003, Mr. Rakhimov\u2019s government privatized Bashneft, with most of its shares ending up in the hands of a company called Bashkir Capital, which Russian prosecutors said was controlled by Mr. Rakhimov\u2019s son, Ural.\u201cIt was privatized outside the law,\u201d said Mr. Navalny, whose Fund for the Fight Against Corruption has regularly highlighted shady transfers of property and wealth through government auctions and contracts. Even Russia\u2019s auditing chamber criticized the sale, but with the evident blessing of the Kremlin, the deal was upheld in court \u2014 until investigators, with no explanation, revisited the deal in April.Mr. Yevtushenkov became involved in 2005 when his company acquired $600 million in shares in the newly privatized Bashneft; in 2009, he acquired a controlling share for another $2 billion, something that could not have happened, executives and analysts here said, without the tacit approval of the president at the time, Dmitri A. Medvedev, and the paramount leader, Mr. Putin, who was then prime minister.Mr. Yevtushenkov, once a functionary in the office of Moscow\u2019s powerful former mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov, founded Sistema in 1993 and built a business empire that included the telecommunications giant MTS, as well as real estate, media and retail investments. By the time of his arrest the company was worth an estimated $15 billion. Despite his political ties to Mr. Luzhkov, whom Mr. Medvedev dismissed in 2010 after an internal power struggle, Mr. Yevtushenkov nurtured close ties with the Kremlin. He never spoke out in a way that would attract its ire. \u201cHe\u2019s a very commercially minded kind of person,\u201d Mr. Lebedev said, \u201cbut he\u2019s also by the book.\u201dUnder Sistema\u2019s ownership, production at Bashneft increased at a time when Rosneft struggled, despite a major expansion that included the takeover of another oil company, TNK-BP, for $55 billion. Since the annexation of Crimea, the company has come under the sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and other countries. Two people who work for Mr. Yevtushenkov, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, said they believed that Mr. Sechin personally was behind the takeover of Bashneft, pressing Mr. Putin to revisit the circumstances of the privatization as a pretense in hopes of increasing Rosneft\u2019s production and cash flow. Rosneft had approached Mr. Yevtushenkov last year about the possibility of a merger or sale, according to news reports at the time, but Mr. Yevtushenkov resisted, and instead prepared a public offering of the company\u2019s shares in London. The deterioration of relations with the West in the wake of the war in Ukraine appeared to make the sale of Bashneft\u2019s stocks abroad increasingly worrisome to the Kremlin. In the weeks that followed the annexation of Crimea in March, the powerful Investigative Committee \u2014 an investigative body often seen as pursuing political cases at the Kremlin\u2019s behest \u2014 quietly began a civil and criminal inquiry into Bashneft that exploded into public only in July. Tellingly, in his annual news conference at the Kremlin on Dec. 19, Mr. Putin said that the case against Bashneft had nothing to do with the privatization of the company in the 2000s, but rather with the original transfer of the company from federal to regional authorities in the early 1990s. That raised the question of why Mr. Yevtushenkov had been arrested at all, since he was not involved until much later, and the company has argued it was a good-faith buyer of Bashneft. Mr. Putin maintained that the Kremlin had no intention of reversing the notoriously murky privatizations of the past, but the result was the same anyway. Sergei V. Pugachev, a self-exiled banker who is now fighting Russia\u2019s attempts to freeze his assets, said the case highlighted Mr. Putin\u2019s longstanding strategy to subdue businessmen who would work independently of the Kremlin.\u201cHe saw that there are people who have big businesses, companies and other assets,\u201d Mr. Pugachev said, referring to Mr. Putin\u2019s rise to power in 2000. \u201cAnd from that moment on he felt himself a part of that system, and his goal became to get on top of that system. And that means he has to control everything.\u201dWhat happened next followed a pattern that has become familiar. As happened in the case of Mr. Lebedev and Mr. Pugachev, a legal assault began from multiple directions, like a swarm unleashed by an informal signal from Mr. Putin. \u201cPutin gives an order,\u201d Mr. Navalny said, \u201cmaybe \u2018act according to the law.\u2019 And the words \u2018act according to the law\u2019 means do whatever you want in the legal system.\u201dOn July 15, investigators arrested a prominent Armenian businessman and philanthropist, Levon Airapetyan, as he landed at Moscow\u2019s Domodedovo airport after arriving from France, accusing him of acting as a middleman in the sale of Bashneft, along with its former chief executive, Ural Rakhimov. The same day, a court ordered a freeze on Bashneft\u2019s shares. Mr. Yevtushenkov was summoned for questioning a week later.\u201cAny government will always find a way to put you in your place, no matter how strong you are in the international arena, no matter what business you may have there,\u201d he said, describing transitional market economies that he said would take a generation to break free from state control. \u201cAnd if suddenly it turns out that you declared one thing but did something else, then the punishment, directly or indirectly, will come soon enough.\u201dMysterious Legal AssaultAccording to Mr. Pugachev, Mr. Yevtushenkov himself did not understand what he had done, if anything, to trigger the legal assault. He said they met in his London office only two weeks before Mr. Yevtushenkov was placed under house arrest on Sept. 17. Mr. Pugachev was once close enough to the corridors of power that he was known as the \u201cKremlin\u2019s banker,\u201d but is now a fugitive from Russian justice. He once controlled a banking, real estate and shipbuilding empire, until the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 led to a flurry of difficulties with the government and accusations of fraud and embezzlement. A bank he founded, Mezhprombank, foundered under a crushing debt, some of which came from a bailout approved by the Central Bank in response to the crisis. Although Mr. Putin, then the prime minister, repeatedly promised that the government would compensate Mr. Pugachev for costs exceeding $1 billion, negotiations bogged down and he was never paid, he said. When Mezhprombank collapsed in 2010, the government accused Mr. Pugachev of bankrupting the bank, though Mr. Pugachev claimed that the bank\u2019s legal troubles were used as a pretext to seize two shipyards he owned in St. Petersburg and offered as collateral for the Central Bank loans. Mr. Putin, he said, had urged him to sell the shipyards \u2014 which built, among other things, a nuclear-powered icebreaker at the center of Russia\u2019s ambitions to exploit the Arctic\u2019s natural resources \u2014 to the state company United Shipbuilding Corporation. At the time, the corporation was headed by Mr. Sechin, who also served as a deputy prime minister. Mr. Pugachev said he began negotiations and had the two shipyards valued at $3.5 billion, but it became clear that he had lost the protection he once felt his relationship with Mr. Putin provided. With his financial empire crumbling, he made one last appeal. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve done everything I can for you,\u201d he recalled Mr. Putin telling him. \u201cGood luck.\u201d After a series of court appeals by the Central Bank, the two shipyards were sold in 2012 for less than $500 million, far below their estimated value. He said that he warned Mr. Yevtushenkov that he should not return to Moscow, citing his own troubled exile. \u201cListen,\u201d Mr. Pugachev said he told Mr. Yevtushenkov, \u201cyou must take one manly step in your life.\u201d He said that he added: \u201cYou must spit on all this. Stay in London. You have enough money here. You won\u2019t starve. You\u2019re not poor. Then, I don\u2019t know, maybe then you\u2019ll go to court. You\u2019ll figure it out. But if you go back there, I think you\u2019ll have problems.\u201dGiving Up Without a FightAfter Mr. Yevtushenkov\u2019s arrest in September, a court ordered the seizure of Bashneft\u2019s frozen shares, then still worth about $4 billion. Mr. Yevtushenkov\u2019s company issued a statement maintaining that the purchase of Bashneft had been \u201clegal and transparent.\u201d But with Mr. Yevtushenkov restricted to his home, able for a time to meet with only his lawyers, the company sought to contain the damage, including more than $3 billion in dividends that it had earned and distributed from Bashneft. Instead of fighting the court\u2019s seizure, the company abandoned its right to appeal a court ruling, citing the \u201cbest interest of the company,\u201d essentially ceding one of its biggest assets without a fight. And in early December, the shares reverted to the state.In the end, Mr. Yevtushenkov was never charged with any crime, though Mr. Airapetyan remains under house arrest, and Ural Rakhimov, who is reported to have fled to Austria, is also subject to an international warrant. The ease with which the state reacquired Bashneft, one of the country\u2019s most profitable oil companies, underscored the virtually uncontested power that Mr. Putin and his closest circle of advisers are able to wield over Russia\u2019s economy and, especially, its natural resources. For now, at least, the economic turmoil that has engulfed Russia after the conflict in Ukraine and the drop in oil prices have done little to curb Mr. Putin\u2019s grip. Mr. Navalny said that the political and economic crisis had further tightened the circle of advisers around Mr. Putin, increasing the influence of hard-liners at the expense of those who once encouraged a more liberal economy. He said the Kremlin was now in a siege mentality. \u201cThe circle of decision makers has grown smaller,\u201d he said in an interview in his tidy apartment in a Soviet-era block in southwestern Moscow, where he has been confined since February except for police escorts to his court appearances. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to get to see Putin to resolve one\u2019s own business problems.\u201d In his last court appearance, prosecutors asked the judge to sentence him to 10 years in prison on charges that he and his brother, Oleg, defrauded two companies, one of which is the Russian subsidiary of the French cosmetic company Yves Rocher, even though the company\u2019s representative said the brothers had committed no crime against it.

{"Headline": "Saving the Earth Without Losing a Buck", "Date": "2014-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPIEDRAS BLANCAS, Costa Rica \u2014 When he was growing up in Pennsylvania, Dave Angstadt\u2019s favorite movie was \u201cSwiss Family Robinson,\u201d the story of a family living in a tree house on a deserted island.Mr. Angstadt, 60, a business consultant and former professional basketball player, was thinking of the plucky Robinson clan recently, when he decided to invest $250,000 to build a 1,500-square-foot tree house in Finca Bellavista, a development in the jungle in southwest Costa Rica.\u201cBeing self-sustainable, living in a tree, fending for yourself, figuring stuff out, always intrigued me,\u201d said Mr. Angstadt, who plans to use the house as a personal retreat for friends and family.Finca Bellavista, which is more than a mile from the nearest town and accessible only by unpaved roads, is one of several projects in Costa Rica targeting a new generation of buyers looking for an eco-friendly alternative to the second-home developments that line the coast.While sales of second homes remain sluggish in the wake of the 2008 crash, eco-conscious buyers, primarily from North America, are playing an increasing role in the Costa Rica market, developers and sales agents say. And instead of $1 million beachfront homes, many of these buyers are interested in simpler, inland projects touting sustainable elements and with prices of $250,000 to $400,000. (Prices in Costa Rica are typically quoted in United States dollars.)\u201cPeople are more humble,\u201d said Richard Lemire, a developer in Manuel Antonio, a centrally located community on the country\u2019s western shore. \u201cBig homes are not so sexy anymore.\u201dBuyers in eco-centric projects typically base their purchase decision on a variety of factors, including the location and the investment potential, agents say. And not all of them are solely focused on saving the Earth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I am an environmentalist,\u201d said Al Molnar, 47, who bought eight acres in a project in 2012.Mr. Molnar, who owns a sports agency in Canada, spent $260,000 for the land in NatureWalk, a combination agriculture and residential development covering 1,200 acres east of the coastal town of Jac\u00f3, Costa Rica. A buyer must agree to allow 85 percent of the land to be used for crops such as vanilla, coffee, teak and pineapple; in return, the buyer receives the bulk of the revenue from the crops and the right to build a home on the remaining land.Mr. Molnar primarily viewed the purchase as an investment, a way to diversify his portfolio. But he plans to build a home on the property, and he considers the sustainability aspects to be a bonus. \u201cThe fact that they weren\u2019t destroying the land to develop it into something else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt alleviated a little guilt about how things are being done in the world right now.\u201dAware of buyers like Mr. Molnar, the developer of NatureWalk, the Canadian-based PRG Group, changed its marketing strategy. Instead of focusing on the environmental aspects, the developer now emphasizes the potential revenue, catering to what the company president, Tim Alexander, calls \u201ceconomic environmentalism.\u201dSince beginning sales in 2011, PRG has sold more than 100 lots, with prices ranging from $55,000 to $100,000 for parcels of a quarter-acre to one and a quarter acres. \u201cIt\u2019s not a decision based on the eco-value,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cThey look for both, but the investment comes first.\u201dEco-developments also are benefiting from the growing group of buyers in North America concerned about the state of the world economy, local industry executives say.Osa Mountain Village Resort, located in the mountains along the southern Pacific coast, is billed as \u201ca sustainable, fully functional, food-producing resort community.\u201d In addition to a secluded setting and enticing swimming pools, the resort offers residents a steady supply of fresh fruits, vegetables and other food items.The availability of an independent food supply is a key component for many buyers, said the developer, Jim Gale. \u201cWithout the food production, we\u2019d have 80 percent less sales,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main thing is food security.\u201dOsa has sold more than 100 properties in the last four years, Mr. Gale said. Sixty of the 150 planned homes have been built, with prices ranging from $69,000 for a rustic 250-square-foot house to $259,000 for a 1,200-square-foot condo with full amenities.In 2011, Dan Lutz, a chiropractor in Minnesota, paid about $125,000 in a pre-construction deal for a 1,300-square-foot apartment. He said he made the purchase because he was concerned that the United States was on an \u201cunsustainable trajectory.\u201d\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it just made sense to have a piece of real estate where you do have a guaranteed abundance of food, you have guaranteed abundance of water,\u201d said Mr. Lutz, 44. \u201cWe had just went through a big recession, it was kind of scary. I thought I better have a Plan B.\u201d For now, he uses the house on vacations, and loans it to family and friends.In Finca Bellavista, the tree house development, the developers have sold 54 of the 96 available plots, totaling 100 acres, since 2006. Lots average about two acres and are typically priced from $40,000 to $80,000, depending on the location and accessibility.Buyers purchase the land and the right to build a house in selected trees. At this point, 12 tree houses have been built, connected to the rest of the project by narrow trails, rope ladders and zip lines. Although amenities are few, there is a fiber optic connection to the base camp, as the developers call the headquarters, for owners who are not quite ready to completely discard civilization.Mr. Angstadt\u2019s custom-designed tree house will have a flushing toilet and a solar-heated hot water shower, in addition to a wide deck and extra high ceilings to accommodate his 6-foot-8 frame.\u201cI appreciate a good hot shower and I appreciate a flushed toilet,\u201d said Mr. Angstadt, who hopes to start construction on his tree house in early 2015. \u201cBut I\u2019m also quite happy out there getting muddy and washing off in the river.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Japan, a Landslide Victory for Shinzo Abe\u2019s Party, Despite Scant Enthusiasm", "Date": "2014-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring the elections, however, he remained vague on what he would do to breathe new life into Abenomics \u2014 policies that have so far amounted to little more than pressing the central bank to flood the economy with cash. Now that Mr. Abe has won a convincing victory, he and his party face the hard part: actually delivering on those promises to engineer a more lasting recovery.Economists have called on Mr. Abe to follow through with promised changes to open Japan\u2019s still-protected markets to greater competition \u2014 such as by making it easier for young Japanese to create start-ups \u2014 and to more trade and foreign investment.The promised changes, however, will require Mr. Abe to challenge many of the vested interest groups that supported him during this election, like the powerful national farming cooperatives.At the same time, political analysts have also been speculating about what the conservative Mr. Abe may attempt outside the economic realm, something about which he said even less during the elections. \u201cNow that he was won such a big victory, Prime Minister Abe has given no clear message on what will he try to accomplish with it,\u201d said Naoto Nonaka, a political expert at Gakushuin University in Tokyo. \u201cDespite the rhetoric about Abenomics, his main goal seemed to be securing his own political position.\u201dIf so, Mr. Abe appears to have succeeded. The final tally shows the prime minister\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party won 291 of the 475 seats up for grabs in the powerful lower house. That is slightly fewer than its pre-election total of 295 seats, but enough to still hold a commanding majority in the chamber.After the size of the victory became apparent, a smiling Mr. Abe appeared before television cameras at the Tokyo headquarters of his party to affix red roses to the names of victorious Liberal Democratic candidates. He said the victory was a call from voters to continue with his Abenomics policies to revitalize Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy after the United States and China.He also seemed to recognize that there was growing discontent with his policies, which have bolstered the stock market but have yet to increase the real incomes of working Japanese.\u201cAbenomics is still unfinished,\u201d Mr. Abe said on live television. \u201cWe have ended the dark stagnation of two or three years ago, but there are still many people who haven\u2019t felt the benefits yet. We need to make sure that the benefits reach them.\u201dIndeed, despite the size of the victory on Sunday, analysts like Mr. Nonaka said the results did not represent an enthusiastic embrace of Mr. Abe and his party by voters. Rather, they said, the biggest reason for the victory may have been the fact that opposition parties remain in disarray after their last crushing defeat at the polls, two years ago.In street interviews, Japanese voters said that with the opposition offering no appealing alternatives, they felt no choice but to support the Liberal Democrats. In Chofu, a suburb of Tokyo, voters said that they had not felt any benefits from Abenomics, but said that they were still better than the policies of the opposition Democratic Party, which was widely seen here as mismanaging the country during a stint in power a few years ago.\u201cAbenomics is not a key issue for me, but there are no other parties who deserve my vote,\u201d said Masashi Shibata, 38, a public employee who said he had voted for the Liberal Democrats. \u201cThe Liberal Democratic Party is still better than the Democratic Party.\u201dIn fact, many Japanese appeared to decide not to vote at all. Just some 52 percent of eligible Japanese cast votes on Sunday, the lowest turnout in postwar Japanese history.Experts said the low turnout benefited the well-organized Liberal Democrats and their still formidable rural vote-gathering machines. The largest opposition group, the Democratic Party, trailed far behind in the final tally, with 73 seats, though it surpassed its pre-election total of 62 seats.One of the few winners in the opposition was the tiny Communist Party of Japan, which nearly tripled its number of seats to 21, enough to allow the party to submit bills for a vote by the lower house. The Communists seemed to draw many of the protest votes of disgruntled voters, analysts said.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Chofu, Japan.Advertisement"}

Instead, he has courageously gone as far as he can, within the constraints of an outmoded 1996 law that imposes stiff sanctions on Cuba in the pursuit of regime change. \u201cThese 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new approach.\u201d Cuba\u2019s president, Ra\u00fal Castro, deserves credit for his pragmatism. While Cuba remains a repressive police state with a failed economy, under his leadership since 2008, the country has begun a process of economic reforms that have empowered ordinary Cubans and lifted travel restrictions the government cruelly imposed on its citizens. The changes the Obama administration announced have the potential to empower Cuba\u2019s growing entrepreneurial class by permitting commercial and financial transactions with the United States. The White House also intends to make it easier for American technology companies to upgrade the island\u2019s primitive Internet systems, a step that could go a long way toward strengthening civil society. Given Cuba\u2019s complicated history with the United States, it\u2019s all but certain that this new chapter will include suspicion and backsliding. Leaders in both countries must make every effort to deal with those in a rational, constructive way. The United States has been right to press for greater personal freedoms and democratic change. But its punitive approach has been overwhelmingly counterproductive. Going forward, American support for Cuba\u2019s civil society and dissidents is likely to become more effective, in good part because other governments in the Western Hemisphere will no longer be able to treat Cuba as a victim of the United States\u2019 pointlessly harsh policy. As part of the negotiations, the Cuban government released an unnamed American intelligence agent who had been imprisoned for nearly 20 years and Alan Gross, a 65-year-old American subcontractor who had been imprisoned in Havana since 2009. The United States, meanwhile, released three Cuban spies who have served more than 13 years in prison. The prisoner swap paved the way for a policy overhaul that could become Mr. Obama\u2019s top foreign policy legacy. Administration officials recognize that Congress is unlikely to take complementary steps toward a healthier relationship with Cuba anytime soon. But this move will inevitably inform the debate about the merits of engagement. In all likelihood, history will prove Mr. Obama right. Leer en espa\u00f1ol (Read in Spanish) \u00bbAdvertisement"}

Who exactly is an immigrant?President Obama hasn\u2019t answered either question; nor have many of his critics. Our immigration policy should guard the territorial integrity of American borders and enhance the American economy. Adhering to these goals would disperse much fog around current disputation. Mr. Obama might tell us, for example, how many of his chosen four million speak English, and why a family relationship should outweigh skills an immigrant can bring to the American economy.A fugitive is not an immigrant. To equate the two would equate someone who smashes a window to enter your living room with someone who knocks on your front door to make a request. That the intruder smiles and offers to mow your lawn does not negate his lawless act.Tens of millions of foreigners over recent years have knocked on our door hoping for United States residency and have awaited the outcome. Decades ago I entered the United States on a student visa from Australia, and stayed on a J1 exchange visa. Later I applied to be an immigrant, and five years after receiving my green card, I got a certificate of citizenship. Far from begrudging the long wait and paperwork, I found the process an excellent test for the honor of United States citizenship.We need immigrants and have laws to deal with the requests in line with our security and economic interests. It\u2019s a terrible precedent to reward lawbreakers and insult the sincerity of true immigrants. The writer is a China expert at Harvard\u2019s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside a Chinese Test-Prep Factory", "Date": "2014-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by14 PhotosThe main street of Maotanchang, a secluded town in the furrowed hills of eastern China\u2019s Anhui province, was nearly deserted. A man dozed on a motorized rickshaw, while two old women with hoes shuffled toward the rice paddies outside town. It was 11:44 on a Sunday morning last spring, and the row of shops selling food, tea and books by the pound stood empty. Even the town\u2019s sacred tree lured no supplicants; beneath its broad limbs, a single bundle of incense smoldered on a pile of ash.Yang and I had communicated on social media for weeks, and the 18-year-old seemed almost giddy to be hosting an American expatriate. Yet there was a crisis brewing. Even with all the relentless practice, Yang\u2019s scores were slipping, a fact that clouded over the lunch I ate with his family in the single room that he and his mother shared near the sacred tree. We were joined by Yang\u2019s father, visiting for the afternoon, and his closest friend from his home village, a classmate named Cao Yingsheng \u2014 all squeezed into a space barely big enough for a bunk bed, a desk and a rice cooker. The room\u2019s rent, however, was high, rivaling rates in downtown Beijing, and it represented only part of the sacrifice Yang\u2019s parents made to help him, their only son, become the first family member to attend college.Yang was eager to be a good host. But as his mother plied us with chicken wings and sesame tofu, his eyelids drooped. Yang\u2019s mother wanted him to study after lunch, but his father interceded. \u201cThe brain needs a rest, too,\u201d he told his wife. With hardly a word, Yang climbed into the top bunk and collapsed with his high-tops still on.Isolated in the foothills of Anhui, two hours from the nearest city, Maotanchang caters mostly to such students and prides itself on eliminating the distractions of modern life. Cellphones and laptops are forbidden; the dormitories, where roughly half the students live, were designed without electrical outlets. Romance is banned. In town, where the rest of the students live, mostly with their mothers in tiny partitioned rooms, the local government has shut down all forms of entertainment. This may be the only town in China with no video arcade, billiards hall or Internet cafe. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do but study,\u201d Yang says.Inside the gate, Yang Qi eagerly pointed out the fruits of the school\u2019s recent $32 million expansion: a gargantuan LED screen, a sports complex, giant statues of Chairman Mao and Deng Xiaoping and, up on the ridge above, a glimmering hourglass-shaped building \u2014 administrative offices that looked more like an airport control tower or a prison lookout. The grounds themselves were as manicured as an American college campus, albeit one with decorative rocks adorned with the school\u2019s motto: \u201cWe don\u2019t compete with intelligence but with hard work!\u201dYang\u2019s parents and I lingered in front of the rows of dormitories where their son spent his first two years at Maotanchang. Ten students, sometimes 12, bunked in each room. The wire mesh covering the windows \u2014 \u201cto prevent suicide,\u201d one student told me later, only half-joking \u2014 was festooned with drying socks, underwear, T-shirts and shoes. The dorms have few amenities \u2014 no electrical outlets, no laundry room, not even, until a separate bathhouse was installed last year, hot water. There is, students note, one high-tech device: an electronic fingerprint scanner that teachers log into every night to verify that they have conducted their obligatory bed checks.Perhaps nobody on campus is more motivated \u2014 and exhausted \u2014 than Maotanchang\u2019s 500 teachers, whose jobs hinge on their students\u2019 success. Base salaries for teachers are two to three times as high as China\u2019s normal public-\u00adschool wages, and bonuses can easily double their incomes. For each student who gets into a first-tier university, the six-member teacher teams (a head teacher and five subject teachers) share a $500 reward. \u201cThey make good money,\u201d Yang told me, \u201cbut they face even worse pressure than we do.\u201dThe head teachers\u2019 schedules are so grueling \u2014 17-hour days monitoring classes of 100 to 170 students \u2014 that the school has decreed that only young, single men can fill the job. The competition to hang onto these spots is intense. Charts posted on the walls of the faculty room rank classes by cumulative test scores from week to week. Teachers whose classes finish in last place at year\u2019s end can expect to be fired. It\u2019s no wonder that teachers\u2019 motivational methods can be tough. Besides rapping knuckles with rulers, students told me, some teachers pit them against one another in practice-test \u201cdeath matches\u201d \u2014 the losers must remain standing all morning. In one much-discussed case, the mother of a tardy student was forced to stand outside her son\u2019s class for a week as punishment. For the repeat students, the teachers have a merciless mantra: \u201cAlways remember your failure!\u201dXu grew up as one of China\u2019s 60 million \u201cleft behind\u201d children, raised by his grandparents while his parents worked as migrant fruit sellers in the distant city Wuxi. His grandfather summoned his parents home to Hongjing village, however, when Xu spun out of control in middle school \u2014 skipping classes, sneaking out with his friends, becoming obsessed with video games. The family income dropped when his mother stopped working to devote herself to his education. Despite bearing down to please his mother, Xu still faltered on the high-school entrance exam, ruining his chance to get into the region\u2019s best high schools. His mother was so upset that she barely spoke to him for days. With few options left for high school, Xu turned to Maotanchang. \u201cI only knew that the school was very strict, to the point that some students had supposedly committed suicide,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat convinced me. I didn\u2019t believe I could discipline myself otherwise.\u201dBy his third year at Maotanchang, when his mother came to live with him in a rented room in town, Xu\u2019s test scores began rising to the top of his grade \u2014 first among thousands. Xu\u2019s head teacher pulled him aside early in the spring of 2013 to tell him that he had a chance to become the first Maotanchang student ever to be admitted to Beijing\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University, known as the M.I.T. of China. Over the years, Maotanchang has earned a reputation as an assembly line for second-tier universities. Now, the teacher told him, school administrators were so keen to have a student admitted to one of China\u2019s top universities that they were offering a sizable reward: nearly $50,000 to be divided equally among Xu\u2019s family, his middle school and \u2014 naturally \u2014 his teachers at Maotanchang.When I met Xu on Tsinghua\u2019s grassy campus last spring, near the end of his first year, he still looked out of place: a young villager in a threadbare blazer, sleeves pushed up his arms. Many of the students around us were members of China\u2019s urban elite, wealthy and worldly young adults armed with iPhones, frequent-flier cards and a nuanced understanding of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201dXu looked gaunt. He showed me his student-ID photo, taken the previous fall, when his face was round and fleshy. \u201cI\u2019ve lost seven kilos\u201d \u2014 15 pounds \u2014 \u201cbecause I can\u2019t get used to the food,\u201d he said. The freedom of university life took adjustment, too. \u201cThere are no rules here,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so confused during first semester, because nobody told me what to do.\u201d Xu, an engineering major, is learning to enjoy new things: hanging out with friends, doing volunteer work, spending weekend days in the park. \u201cI\u2019m still studying hard,\u201d said Xu, who wants to pursue graduate studies in the United States. \u201cBut now I can finally breathe.\u201dFor a town that turns test preparation into a mechanical act of memorization and regurgitation, Maotanchang remains a place of desperate faith and superstition. Most students have a talisman of some sort, whether it\u2019s red underwear (red clothing is believed to be lucky), shoes from a company called Anta (their check-mark logo is reminiscent of a correct answer) or a pouch of \u201cbrain rejuvenating\u201d tea bought from vendors outside the school gates. The town\u2019s best-selling nutritional supplements are called Clear Mind and Six Walnuts (the nuts are considered mind-boosters in large part because they resemble brains). Yang\u2019s parents did not seem especially superstitious, but they paid high rent to live close to the mystical tree and its three-foot-high pile of incense ash. \u201cIf you don\u2019t pray to the tree, you can\u2019t pass,\u201d Yang says, repeating a local saying.Yang, however, wasn\u2019t feeling very lucky. His smile had disappeared, along with his banter about basketball and the cousin he hoped to join in Shanghai. Yang\u2019s mother was gone, too. Her anxiety had started to make her son tense and irritable, so he asked if his grandfather could take over for her in the final weeks. Now there was only one day left, and Yang had no time for anything but study. His weary summation of years of unceasing effort: \u201cI\u2019m almost done.\u201dIt was 5 a.m. when we pulled into Maotanchang, but the crowd of mothers gathered around the sacred tree was already three deep. The flames from their bundles of incense were so hot and the pile of ash so big that we almost couldn\u2019t squeeze past to Yang\u2019s rented room. His mother lit some sticks of incense, planted them in the ash pile and bobbed her head forward and back in prayer. A woman next to her gently swung a bag of eggs in the smoke \u2014 eggs, given their head-like shape, are considered a symbol of intelligence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Slow Death of \u2018Do Not Track\u2019", "Date": "2014-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIf regulators go along, the rules would allow the largest Internet giants to continue scooping up data about users on their own sites and on other sites that include their plug-ins, such as Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d button or an embedded YouTube video. This giant loophole would make \u201cDo Not Track\u201d meaningless. How did we get into this mess? For starters, the Federal Trade Commission doesn\u2019t seem to fully understand the nature of the Internet. Essentially, the collection of user data makes possible the free access to maps, email, games, music, social networks and other services. Digital privacy advocates, understandably, view the online ecosystem differently. They are alarmed by the growth of the surveillance economy, in which companies compile and store information about what a user reads, looks for, clicks on or buys. In this world, disclosure is fairly meaningless, because almost no one reads the terms of service that define the relationship between the customer and the company. The regulatory process is the wrong way to address this fundamental tension. If the government wants to shift the Internet economy away from a \u201cbarter\u201d system (exchanging personal data for free services) toward a subscription-based system, Congress should take charge.The outcome could be worse than doing nothing at all.The industry recommendation is expected to distinguish between companies that have a \u201cfirst party\u201d relationship with users \u2014 consumer-facing Internet content providers and Internet service providers \u2014 and \u201cthird party\u201d companies, which include most small advertising-technology companies. First-party relationships would be created if the user \u201cintends to interact\u201d with the web company (or a service provider acting on behalf of that company). For example, logging into Facebook would count as a \u201cuser action\u201d that would allow Facebook to track your activity \u201cacross multiple distinct contexts,\u201d including other websites.In contrast, companies with third-party relationships would have far more limited tracking abilities. For example, if a user visits a site that integrates an advertisement with content from other sources, the ad server would not be able to place a tracking \u201ccookie\u201d for marketing purposes on your device without your consent. This dubious distinction would harm competition in the online ad market by turning \u201cDo Not Track\u201d into \u201cDo Not Track for small ad companies only.\u201d Google, Facebook and other large companies that operate both first- and third-party businesses would be able to use data they gather through their first-party relationships to compete in the third-party ad market. Smaller ad tech companies would be at a severe competitive disadvantage and could even be driven out of the market.The Federal Trade Commission shouldn\u2019t help pick winners and losers through a murky process that has devolved into an effort to protect the positions of Internet giants. It should stay focused on policing the behavior of companies that short-shrift consumers or restrict competition. If the industry group recommends a lopsided version of \u201cDo Not Track,\u201d as expected, the commission should not go along with it. The correct balance between privacy and competition is a decision better left to Congress than to a feckless regulator. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Cheerful Signs in the Labor Market, Even for Those Not Now Looking ", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsIT was called the \u201cjobless recovery\u201d after the Great Recession ended in June 2009, and employment did not hit bottom until early 2010. But now, employment is growing at the fastest pace in years and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8 percent from a peak of 10 percent.One reason the unemployment rate has declined, however, is that a lot of people seem to have dropped out of the labor force and, therefore, are not being counted as unemployed. Some people always drop out during recessions, when they conclude that prospects of finding work are slim. But they normally come back when the market improves.It is not just the aging of the baby boomers that has caused the decline. Early boomers are now over 65, and people of that age are more likely to have retired and left the labor force. But as the accompanying charts show, the labor force participation rate has declined among all age groups under the age of 62. A number of reasons have been suggested for the declines. Perhaps there is a greater skills mismatch, as the new jobs being created demand skills that unemployed people lack. Perhaps people who could not find work when they left school, and have been out of work for years, are simply estranged from the labor market. If those are major factors, then efforts to stimulate the economy might do little to get them into jobs. But if there is a large cyclical factor \u2014 if the effect of the recession has simply been stronger and longer-lasting than in most previous downturns \u2014 then we ought to see a pickup in the labor force participation rates for prime age groups. Those who dropped out of the labor force because they could not find jobs nearly as good as the ones they previously held might be more tempted to return, particularly if tentative signs that wages are rising turn out to be correct.The coming year may provide the answer. Paradoxically, the best outcome might be if the number of new jobs continues to increase at a good pace but the unemployment rate stops falling, or at least declines more slowly. That would happen if more people decide to re-enter the labor market, ending the decline in the labor market participation rates among prime age workers, those 25 to 54 years of age.The unemployment rate, and the labor market participation rate, are based on a monthly survey of households, asking whether each person over the age of 16 is working or, if not, is actively looking for work. The results of that survey can be volatile, particularly among relatively small groups, and, of course, there are seasonal factors. Teenagers are far more likely to be in the labor force during the summer than when school is in session.The charts reflect the smallest age groups for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases results each month. To overcome the seasonal problem, as well as to minimize the volatility, the figures presented represent averages for the 12 months ending in each month shown. Most of the groups cover five-year cohorts, like 25 to 29, but those for the teenage years and the early 60s are shown in smaller categories because those are ages when many people are either entering or leaving the labor force. It should be noted that people move from group to group as they get older. Someone who was 29 in 2007 is now 36.As can be seen from the charts, the sharpest declines in the proportion of people working or looking for work have come among teenagers and those in their early 20s. That may not be bad news, if it indicates more such people are staying in school.Early in the recession, the proportion of men in the labor force declined. But more women age 25 to 39 joined the labor force, perhaps reflecting wives seeking jobs as the employment outlook darkened for their husbands. As the recession worsened, however, women of those ages began to leave the labor force.Above the age of 55, labor force participation rates initially rose for most groups after the recession began, no doubt because some people put off retirement. But the rates for both men and women in the 55-to-59 age group are now lower than they were when the recession began. Some people can choose when to retire; others have that decision made for them by their employers. Older groups still have higher participation rates than before the recession, but some of those rates have slipped this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Have Democrats Failed the White Working Class?", "Date": "2014-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy don\u2019t white working-class voters recognize where their economic interests lie? Somewhat self-righteously, Democrats keep asking themselves that question.A better question would be: What has the Democratic Party done for these voters lately?At work and at home, their lives are worse than they were a generation ago. Their real incomes have fallen, their employment opportunities have diminished, their families have crumbled and their ties to society are fraying.This is how daily life feels, to many in the white working class. Unlike blacks and Hispanics, whites are not the beneficiaries of affirmative action programs designed to open doors to higher education and better jobs for underrepresented minorities; if anything, these programs serve only to limit their horizons.Liberal victories in the sexual and women\u2019s rights revolutions \u2013 victories that have made the lives of many upscale Democrats more productive and satisfying \u2014 appear, from the vantage point of the white working class, to have left many women to struggle as single parents, forced to cope with both male defection from paternal responsibility and the fragmentation of a family structure that was crucial to upward mobility in the postwar period.Both works address broader subjects than the partisan allegiance of working-class whites, but each illuminates the interaction of economic and cultural forces driving these voters away from their New Deal home.\u201cThe young adults without bachelor\u2019s degrees who are the heirs of the industrial working class today are not a cultural vanguard confidently leading the way toward a postmodern family lifestyle,\u201d Cherlin writes. \u201cRather, they are a group making constrained choices.\u201dCherlin uses racial and economic change at Bethlehem Steel\u2019s Baltimore plant at Sparrows Point in the 1970s to show how the experiences of blacks and whites have diverged.Whites at the steel plant, Cherlin writes,viewed the opportunity to move up to a more desired position or to get good entry level jobs for their sons and nephews \u2014 an opportunity long open to whites but for the most part closed off to blacks \u2013 as a basic privilege of being a factory worker.In the 1970s, however, federal civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination against African-Americans began to be enforced just as the number of manufacturing jobs started to decline.\u201cBlack and white workers were all faced with diminishing work opportunities,\u201d Cherlin observes.Suddenly it was harder for anyone to get a job for his son at the Point and at factories around the country. Black and white workers were all faced with diminishing work opportunities, and a job taken by a black applicant seemed like a job taken away from a white applicant. The simultaneous onset of legally enforced labor market changes and the globalization and automation of production quite probably amplified the reactions of whites. The co-occurrence of the easy-to-see increase of the hiring of black workers and the hard-to-understand deterioration of the economy encouraged white workers to blame the former for the latter.Even as blacks experienced the benefits of the drive toward racial equality, which many whites saw as a form of reverse discrimination, the liberal cultural agenda began to champion \u201cexpressive individualist\u201d and \u201crights oriented\u201d values. Many working-class whites saw these values as destructive of familiar hierarchies in which they were accustomed to hold a privileged position.In this way, multiple legal, economic and cultural developments began to overlap.You can see this convergence in another trend Cherlin describes, the transition, beginning in the 1960s, of younger adults from what he calls a \u201cutilitarian self\u201d to an \u201cexpressive self.\u201d The utilitarian self, according to Cherlin, accepts \u201cconformity to external standards \u2014 which included doing what your supervisor at work told you to do.\u201d This conformity was essential for industrial work, \u201cwhich required self-discipline and the suppression of feelings such as alienation and anger.\u201dThe expressive self, in contrast, \u201cemphasizes one\u2019s feelings and emotional satisfaction and the pursuit of a personally fulfilling life.\u201d For the less educated, however, the kind of low-skill, low-wage jobs available to them offered little or no opportunity for self-expression.The expressive self has been a central element of postmodern liberal thinking. But, Cherlin writes,What no one expected was that less educated young adults in the U.S., many of whom are still struggling to ensure an adequate standard of living, would show signs of making the transition before they had achieved affluence.The conversion to liberal self-expressive priorities, then, can be seen as reducing the satisfaction of the less educated as they adapt to the drudgery of service work. The cultural resistance to curbs on individual autonomy also coincided with the divorce revolution of the early 1970s, with a generalized resistance over the past half-century to restrictive social norms, and with the growing percentage of white children living with unmarried mothers without college degrees. The disadvantages of single-parenthood and nonresidential fathers now add to the struggles of the white working class.Cherlin presents a graph showing that from 1980 to 2010, the percentage of white mothers without a college degree who are unmarried goes from 18 to 30 percent. For white mothers with a high school degree, the percentage rises from 11 to 21 percent. For white women with college degrees, the percentage only moves up three points, from 6 to 9 percent.The rise of single parenting \u2013 while freeing some men or women, willingly or unwillingly, from the constrictions of relationships that had begun to chafe \u2014 has substantial consequences. The research paper co-authored by McLanahan and Jencks buttresses Cherlin\u2019s argument, providing evidence to support the contention thatChildren growing up with a single mother are exposed to more family instability and complexity, they have more behavior problems, and they are less likely to finish high school or attend college than children raised by both of their parents.More specifically, McLanahan and Jencks provide data showing that growing up with one parent reduces chances of graduating high school by 40 percent and that father-absence \u201cincreases antisocial behavior, such as aggression, rule breaking, delinquency, and illegal drug use.\u201dRising rates of nonmarital fertility are intricately linked to socioeconomic stratification. On one hand, women of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to have children outside marriage. On the other, children born outside of marriage fare worse on numerous developmental indicators than their peers, disrupting their own eventual socioeconomic attainment. In this way, nonmarital fertility is a channel for the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic inequality.The breakdown of working-class families, then, and the adverse consequences flowing from that breakdown, occurred simultaneously with the collapse of working-class jobs that provided decent incomes to those without college degrees.As Cherlin points out,The percentage of workers who were classified as precision production, crafts, and repair workers, and as operatives, fabricators and construction workers \u2013 in short what we might call blue collar occupations \u2013 decreased from 28 percent in 1970, to 22 percent in 1990, and then to 17 percent in 2010. During this same period, the number of workers who operated lathe, milling and turning machines plummeted from 345,000 to 14,000.The changing job market has been particularly tough for men without college degrees. \u201cBy 1996, the average 30-year-old man with a high school degree earned 20 percent less than a comparable man in 1979,\u201d Cherlin writes. \u201cHe belonged to the first generation of American young men to earn less than their fathers did.\u201dWhat can they do? That is, what big ticket items are left that would buy the loyalty of the middle class for another generation? We already have Social Security and Medicare. We have Obamacare. We have the mortgage interest deduction. What\u2019s left?Drum then elaborates on his question:I\u2019m all in favor of using the power of government to help the middle classes. But what does that mean in terms of concrete political programs that (a) the middle class will associate with Democrats and help win them loyalty and votes, and (b) have even a snowball\u2019s chance of getting passed by Congress? Expansion of Social Security? Expansion of Medicare? Bigger subsidies for Obamacare? Universal pre-K? A massive infrastructure program? Let\u2019s get specific, and let\u2019s not nibble around the edges. Little programs here and there aren\u2019t going to make much difference to the Democrats\u2019 political fortunes. Nor will heroic but vague formulations about rescuing unions or raising taxes on the wealthy by a few points.I would argue that it\u2019s not just a question of new programs \u201cthat would buy the loyalty of the middle class for another generation.\u201d The issues are much deeper and thornier. Over the last half-century, the Democratic Party has taken up the task of providing new life chances \u2013 an emancipation, really \u2014 for those whose situations were once seen as hopeless. Those initiatives, which expanded rights across many fronts, have had costs as well as benefits. Too often the party has failed to address tensions that grew out of the good that the party and the progressive movement in general have done.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why 2014 Is a Big Deal", "Date": "2014-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI WAS just about to go with a column that started like this: When they write the history of the global response to climate change, 2014 could well be seen as the moment when the balance between action and denial tipped decisively toward action. That\u2019s thanks to the convergence of four giant forces: S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, went dry; China and the United States together went green; solar panels went cheap; and Google and Apple went home.But before I could go further, the bottom fell out of the world oil price, and the energy economist Phil Verleger wrote me, saying: \u201cFracking is a technological breakthrough like the introduction of the PC.\u00a0Low-cost producers such as the Saudis will respond to the threat of these increased supplies by holding prices down\u201d \u2014 hoping the price falls below the cost of fracking and knocks some of those American frackers out. In the meantime, though, he added, sustained low prices for oil and gas would \u201cretard\u201d efforts to sell more climate-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles that are helped by high oil prices and slow the shift to more climate-friendly electricity generation by wind and solar that is helped by high gas prices.Technology is a cruel thing. The innovators who\u2019ve made solar panels, wind power and batteries so efficient that they can now compete with coal and gas are the same innovators who are enabling us to extract oil and gas from places we never imagined we could go at prices we never imagined we would reach. Is a third lead sentence possible? There is. In fact, there is an amazing lead waiting to be written. It just takes the right political will. How so?Also, last February, Google bought Nest, for $3.2 billion. Nest makes a $250 smart thermostat that can save homeowners tons of money by learning their temperature preferences and automatically managing their air-conditioners and home heating systems for the greatest efficiency. Also this year, Apple announced the development of the Apple HomeKit, which will enable customers to remotely manage their appliances and home energy systems on their iPhones. When Apple and Google start competing to make homes more energy efficient, watch out. We will likely see nonlinear improvements.But what if Verleger is right \u2014 that just as the cost of computing dropped following the introduction of the PC, fracking technology could flood the world with cheaper and cheaper oil, making it a barrier to reducing emissions?\u00a0There is one way out of this dilemma. Let\u2019s make a hard political choice that\u2019s a win for the climate, our country and our kids: Raise the gasoline tax. \u201cU.S. roads are crumbling,\u201d said Verleger.\u00a0\u201cInfrastructure is collapsing.\u00a0Our railroads are a joke.\u201d Meantime, gasoline prices at the pump are falling toward $2.50 a gallon \u2014 which would be the lowest national average since 2009 \u2014 and consumers are rushing to buy S.U.V.\u2019s and trucks.\u00a0The \u201cclear solution,\u201d said Verleger, is to set a price of, say, $3.50 a gallon for gasoline in America, and then tax any price below that up to that level. Let the Europeans do their own version. \u201cAnd then start spending the billions on infrastructure right now. At a tax of $1 per gallon, the U.S. could raise around $150 billion per year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe investment multiplier would give a further kick to the U.S. economy \u2014 and might even start Europe moving.\u201dSo there is a way to make 2014 that truly decisive year in confronting both climate and rebuilding America, but only our political leaders can write that lead.Maureen Dowd is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Bubble Bursts", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Mr. Putin never had the resources to back his swagger. Russia has an economy roughly the same size as Brazil\u2019s. And, as we\u2019re now seeing, it\u2019s highly vulnerable to financial crisis \u2014 a vulnerability that has a lot to do with the nature of the Putin regime.But Russia\u2019s difficulties are disproportionate to the size of the shock: While oil has indeed plunged, the ruble has plunged even more, and the damage to the Russian economy reaches far beyond the oil sector. Why?Actually, it\u2019s not a puzzle \u2014 and this is, in fact, a movie currency-crisis aficionados like yours truly have seen many times before: Argentina 2002, Indonesia 1998, Mexico 1995, Chile 1982, the list goes on. The kind of crisis Russia now faces is what you get when bad things happen to an economy made vulnerable by large-scale borrowing from abroad \u2014 specifically, large-scale borrowing by the private sector, with the debts denominated in foreign currency, not the currency of the debtor country.In that situation, an adverse shock like a fall in exports can start a vicious downward spiral. When the nation\u2019s currency falls, the balance sheets of local businesses \u2014 which have assets in rubles (or pesos or rupiah) but debts in dollars or euros \u2014 implode. This, in turn, inflicts severe damage on the domestic economy, undermining confidence and depressing the currency even more. And Russia fits the standard playbook.Well, you can answer the second question by walking around Mayfair in London, or (to a lesser extent) Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, especially in the evening, and observing the long rows of luxury residences with no lights on \u2014 residences owned, as the line goes, by Chinese princelings, Middle Eastern sheikhs, and Russian oligarchs. Basically, Russia\u2019s elite has been accumulating assets outside the country \u2014 luxury real estate is only the most visible example \u2014 and the flip side of that accumulation has been rising debt at home.Where does the elite get that kind of money? The answer, of course, is that Putin\u2019s Russia is an extreme version of crony capitalism, indeed, a kleptocracy in which loyalists get to skim off vast sums for their personal use. It all looked sustainable as long as oil prices stayed high. But now the bubble has burst, and the very corruption that sustained the Putin regime has left Russia in dire straits.How does it end? The standard response of a country in Russia\u2019s situation is an International Monetary Fund program that includes emergency loans and forbearance from creditors in return for reform. Obviously that\u2019s not going to happen here, and Russia will try to muddle through on its own, among other things with rules to prevent capital from fleeing the country \u2014 a classic case of locking the barn door after the oligarch is gone.It\u2019s quite a comedown for Mr. Putin. And his swaggering strongman act helped set the stage for the disaster. A more open, accountable regime \u2014 one that wouldn\u2019t have impressed Mr. Giuliani so much \u2014 would have been less corrupt, would probably have run up less debt, and would have been better placed to ride out falling oil prices. Macho posturing, it turns out, makes for bad economies. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Brooklyn, Racing Against the Shabbat Clock at Kings Highway Glatt", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNeighborhood JointKings Highway Glatt is a neighborhood fixture for the large population of Syrian Jews in Gravesend, Brooklyn.Shabbat is the weekly Jewish day of rest. It begins a few minutes before sundown every Friday and ends with the appearance of the first three stars on Saturday evening. During this interlude, Jews are encouraged to reflect and to remember, to appreciate family and to seek a sense of peace. And to eat. For the large population of Syrian Jews living in Gravesend, Brooklyn, the eating part is often sorted out, in the last moments of daylight before Shabbat begins, at a cherished local shop owned and operated by Simon Leviov and his sons. On a recent Friday the greeting \u201cShabbat Shalom\u201d was heard constantly at Kings Highway Glatt, a corner butcher on East Second Street at Kings Highway, the thoroughfare that splits the bucolic side streets of Gravesend. Among the buzzing patrons and employees, there was a current of urgency nearly as frenetic as the oil sizzling in the army of fryers in back, under the eyes of the elder Mr. Leviov. Scores of foil trays \u2014 stuffed with cereal-crusted fried chicken or deep-fried eggplant or a variety of appetizers crisped or baked to various shades of brown \u2014 were ferried out of the kitchen, past the rotisserie chickens and through the savory fog of roasted meat, to be sealed and stacked on the crowded orange counter. Stationed there was Rony Leviov, 22, the younger of the brothers, facing a line of customers waiting for their takeout orders. Adding to the intensity was the constantly ringing phone, manned by Rony\u2019s big brother, Shemaya Leviov, who answers to the nickname \u201cShy\u201d and takes orders with great economy and care: \u201cHello, butcher. Yes. Hi. Of course. Tell me.\u201dShy scribbled down an order that would be rung up by Rony, processed and packed into the ubiquitous orange bags, then loaded into custom-painted vans and Smart cars that would deliver them nonstop, as long as light and custom would allow.Kings Highway Glatt was opened in 1988 by Mr. Leviov, who grew up in Israel and immigrated to Brooklyn as an adolescent. A butcher by trade, Mr. Leviov saw the need for a \u201cglatt\u201d (technically, a butcher shop that prepares meat in a strict religious fashion) that also offered prepared foods for the well-heeled local residents responsible for feeding their traditionally large families not only daily meals, but special-occasion repasts during Hanukkah, Passover and, of course, Shabbat. \u201cIt\u2019s like Thanksgiving once a week for us,\u201d said Rachel Mamiye, who was picking up a few items with the eldest of her four children in tow. \u201cYou know how hard it is to make these things?\u201d she asked, pointing toward the freezers stacked with Middle Eastern delicacies, all manner of stuffed and rolled meats and dough and vegetables. \u201cI do it all myself, of course,\u201d she added, \u201cbut not everybody can make homemade food anymore.\u201dThe fresh meats, displayed along the store\u2019s other wall, run the gamut from racks of lamb to aged prime beef. An assortment of general grocery and specialty items that would make any Syrian expatriate feel at home are crammed wherever there is space, a problem on Fridays, when so much product is moved. \u201cI need tables!\u201d Shy yelled as the takeout orders began to pile up and more trays of fried delicacies arrived from the back. Despite the fervor, the atmosphere was informed by the cordiality of community and respect for the ritual nearly at hand, for it would not be long before the sun faded and the families of Gravesend would close their doors, shut down all electronics and enjoy a day of peace, family and food.

{"Headline": "Home Buyers Are Optimistic but Not Wild-Eyed", "Date": "2014-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewMost of us don\u2019t add up the short-run investment pros and cons when we consider whether to buy a house; instead, we think about the long-term lifestyle we want. That makes sense, because once a house is bought, the owner typically stays in it for a decade or more. And, after all, houses are homes as well as investments. Yet at important points in our lives, we may nonetheless find ourselves focusing on the investment side of housing. Do we want the largest houses we can afford, or should we live modestly \u2014 maybe by renting \u2014 and invest more money elsewhere? In making that decision, we\u2019d benefit by knowing what would happen to a home\u2019s value in 10, 20 or 30 years. Unfortunately, short-run changes in home prices are of virtually no value in answering this question. The best we can do is assess recent trends, and look further back into history.These three reports are fairly consistent, and both our data and that of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange show higher expectations than they did a couple years ago. But these new expectations are hardly wild: If inflation ran at 2 percent a year, the Federal Reserve\u2019s target, the expected appreciation in housing would be an inflation-corrected 2 percent to 3.5 percent a year. So at the moment, there is no evidence of extravagant bubble thinking. Understandably, people back then were excited to think they could borrow 90 percent or more of a home\u2019s value at around 6 percent interest and receive an annualized return of more than 12 percent. That would have been quite a coup. But those expectations were about as wrong as wrong could be. People were living in a bubble, and the bubble eventually burst. Expectations are rising again, but this is nothing like the run-up to the 2006 peak.One wild card in housing prices is the future of the mortgage interest tax deduction. While it\u2019s beloved by many taxpayers, it may not last \u2014 and if it doesn\u2019t, short-term trends could be affected. Ten years from now, there could be another housing boom or bust. But since 1890, the average appreciation of inflation-corrected home prices in the United States has been only a third of 1 percent a year. That\u2019s why housing hasn\u2019t been a great investment. And in 10 years, it may be almost equally likely that real home prices will be higher or lower than they are today. Cultural changes \u2014 like those brought by the Internet \u2014 could also have a profound effect. When our social contacts are increasingly defined by social media, for example, the appeal of living in a permanent physical neighborhood could decline. We don\u2019t really know. This is more sociology than economics.In making the crucial choice of how much housing to buy for the long haul, we must keep in mind that owner-occupied homes aren\u2019t a surefire investment opportunity. You may want to weigh whether you want to deal with a home\u2019s maintenance, or whether you\u2019re committed to staying in one neighborhood and, maybe, at a nearby job. Those factors may be a source of pleasure \u2014 or a burden \u2014 over the next decade. In any case, there\u2019s a good chance they will outweigh the financial prospects of an investment in housing.ROBERT J. SHILLER is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.

{"Headline": "Can Cuba Escape Poverty but Stay Healthy?", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMedical ParadoxCuba has many economic problems, including the inefficiencies of central planning and the long trade embargo with the United States. Yet the country has a thriving public health system that has made its population among the healthiest in the world.\u201cI am often asked why is this poor country so healthy, but you also have to ask why is this healthy country so poor?\u201d said Jerry Spiegel, a professor at the University of British Columbia\u2019s School of Population and Public Health, who has studied the Cuban health system for more than 15 years.Many important drugs are either unavailable in Cuba or so expensive that they are impractical. Specialized medical care is limited. Even basic supplies, like the chlorine used as a disinfectant, can be hard to come by. There was a time when anesthesia was so scarce that surgeons used acupuncture to control patients\u2019 pain during operations.The Communist government has focused efforts on ensuring access to public education, housing and nutrition \u2014 investments that health researchers say can be as important to health as medicine and doctors. Mr. Spiegel said that he had observed an unusual coordination of government functions related to health. When the country was experiencing an outbreak of dengue fever in the 1990s, he said, public officials treated and isolated patients, but also cleaned up the places where mosquitoes that spread the disease were breeding.The result: Cuba\u2019s citizens are much more likely to die from the maladies that kill rich people \u2014 cancer and heart disease \u2014 than the communicable diseases that kill in most poor places.In some ways, Cuba\u2019s health care system may benefit from its relative isolation. In many developing countries with economies the size of Cuba\u2019s, doctors and other medical professionals leave to live and work in the United States. Cuba has suffered no such brain drain. Though the country is poor, its wealth is more evenly distributed than in other poor countries.Mr. Spiegel said that the country\u2019s economic isolation may have other advantages, too: The country has become much more self-reliant, he said, and has invested in its own biomedical research. Those are all features that may change if the United States allows the country to open up to more liberal trade and immigration policies. However, the changes are also likely to bring improved wealth and more advanced medical technologies, which may help the country grow even healthier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Adds New Barrier to Gmail", "Date": "2014-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe blocking began on Friday and has ignited anger and frustration among many Internet users in China. Data from Google shows traffic to Gmail dropping to zero from Chinese servers.But it is not just a matter of convenience for Chinese Internet users. Some foreign companies use Gmail as their corporate email service, for example, and so companies will have to ensure that employees have V.P.N., or virtual private network, software to get into Gmail.That software allows users to bypass the Chinese Internet censorship controls commonly known as the Great Firewall, although the authorities also try to inhibit that software.Google is not the only company to be censored inside China. Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network, is blocked there. Its Instagram photo-sharing service was blocked this fall when pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong began using it to share photos with mainland Chinese users.This time, Gmail appeared to have been singled out. Representatives for Yahoo and Microsoft said on Monday that the companies had heard no complaints from users in China about their email services being blocked. United States tech companies want badly to have a larger presence in China, but have mostly been foiled by local competition and government controls.\u201cAs far as we can tell, the only U.S. Internet company that has really \u2018succeeded\u2019 in China is Yahoo, because Jerry Yang and Terry Semel had the vision and the luck to invest in Alibaba a hundred years ago,\u201d wrote Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a recent note to clients. \u201cNo other Internet company has managed to gain material traction in China, with government opposition one key factor.\u201dChina\u2019s position is that the world\u2019s second-largest economy is open to United States tech companies, but only on the ruling party\u2019s terms. Those terms are essentially to do business through local partnerships, to host data on Chinese soil \u2014 where the government has access to it \u2014 and to remove anything the party deems offensive. Investing in these controls is the de facto tax on entering China.Google has prominently refused those demands, which has for years made it a target of the Chinese government. Google does have limited business in the country, like ad sales, and it recently opened the Google Play store to Chinese developers, allowing them to build apps for Android devices outside of China. But the company\u2019s consumer-facing services, like its search engine, have largely been disrupted or blocked since 2010. Chinese officials had insisted Google censor its search results, angering some top executives at Google, who refused to comply.Some official publications have cited the company as one component of a Western conspiracy to undermine China, similar to accusations they make against Twitter and other American technology companies.So while the latest Gmail-blocking tactics are new, the idea is the same: to block Google, wherever it is, in hopes of causing users enough frustration that they migrate to services like Baidu, a Chinese company that has a popular search engine here, that adhere to party rules.People in China began noticing the new blocking of Gmail over the weekend, as their third-party mail applications failed to download emails from Gmail accounts if the users did not have V.P.N. software switched on.For months, using such mail programs has been the most common way for people in China to keep using Gmail. The Chinese government blocked access to Gmail\u2019s website and other Google websites around the 25th anniversary of the June 4, 1989, protests and fatal government response in Tiananmen Square.But this new move frustrated Chinese and foreign Internet users in the country.\u201cIt\u2019s against the spirit of the Internet,\u201d said Yuan Shengang, chief executive of NetentSec, a Beijing-based cybersecurity company, in a telephone interview.A Chinese technology news website, 36Kr, said in an article that \u201csuch complete access failure to Gmail has no precedent.\u201dLuo Zhiqiu, a lecturer in English at Nanjing University, wrote on his microblog on Sunday that the interference came at \u201ca critical moment for many students who are currently applying for overseas universities.\u201d\u201cTheir contact emails are Gmails,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch blockage brings great inconvenience. Many years later, when they will consider whether they should go back to China, this experience might lead them to choose, without hesitation, not to return.\u201dA Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, was asked at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing about the blocking. She said she knew nothing about it.\u201cChina has consistently had a welcoming and supportive attitude towards foreign investors doing legitimate business here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will, as always, provide an open, transparent and good environment for foreign companies in China.\u201dLast Thursday, Red Flag, a Communist Party journal focused on political theory, published an article by two scholars from the National Defense University that called for greater regulation and monitoring of Internet use in China. The article said foreign organizations or companies, including the United States State Department, were constantly looking for ways to help Internet users in China get around China\u2019s censorship controls. China needed to take \u201cpowerful measures\u201d in response, wrote the authors, Zhao Zhouxian and Xu Zhidong.Edward Wong and Kiki Zhao reported from Beijing and Conor Dougherty from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "In Latin America, Growth Trumps Climate", "Date": "2014-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneBut the brawl between the American economist and the Brazilian environmentalist is the wrong historical precedent.Particularly these days, Brazil doesn\u2019t want its environment protected from development. Stunned by an abrupt slowdown in economic growth over the last three years, it urgently wants its environment exploited, whether this means offering cheaper gas to encourage driving or investing trillions in developing its oil reserves.In the midst of what was called its \u201ceconomic miracle,\u201d Brazil was that year inaugurating the Trans-Amazonian highway. It was planning a mega-dam on the Paran\u00e1 River at Itaip\u00fa and building a nuclear power plant at Angra dos Reis. Brazil not only saw no purpose in protecting its indigenous forests \u2014 it even offered tax incentives to replace them with lucrative Caribbean pine and eucalyptus.Pollution meant progress. Brazil wouldn\u2019t be hoodwinked by conservation proposals that just aimed to keep it in poverty. In Stockholm, Jo\u00e3o Paulo dos Reis Veloso, the representative of Brazil\u2019s military government, invited investors from around the world to \u201cCome pollute Brazil!\u201dYet as calls for substantial and immediate emissions cuts have grown more intense, environmental advocates and allied policy makers seem to be losing sight of developing countries\u2019 nonnegotiable constraint: They will not agree to grow less.Yet Aldo Cerda, who heads corporate affairs at the country\u2019s budding climate exchange, says the intensity of Chile\u2019s carbon use is set to grow significantly over the next 15 years.The tension is also evident in Peru, host of the climate change talks, where the government watered down environmental regulations over the summer to try to pump up flagging growth.Resolving this tension is proving difficult, at best. Take the report issued this year by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It worked on the assumption that every country would cut annual carbon emissions from energy to only 1.6 tons per person by 2050. Brazil, where emissions from energy rose to almost 2.4 tons per person last year, is unlikely to agree to that anytime soon.\u201cBrazilians are very far from understanding that the climate question is an obstacle that slows Brazil\u2019s exploitation of natural resources,\u201d Mr. Leit\u00e3o, the Greenpeace representative, told me. \u201cOn the contrary, Brazil believes that it still has the right to some quota of increased emissions.\u201dIn a 2012 study, Elizabeth A. Stanton, an environmental economist at Synapse Energy Economics, noted that projections by the International Energy Agency, on which leading climate models are based, assume that the least developed countries will fail to close the prosperity gap with the rich of the world.Income per person in the world\u2019s poorest countries \u2014 about one-27th of that of people in the rich world \u2014 would inch ahead to one-20th in the year 2105.The world\u2019s poorest countries may well fail to overcome their misery. Still, the development imperative will beat the climate imperative every time.Deforestation in the Amazon \u2014 the country\u2019s main contribution to climate change \u2014 slowed sharply. Even as mineral and agricultural exports powered an economic boom that brought almost 25 million Brazilians out of poverty, greenhouse gas emissions fell by almost half from 2004 to 2012.But when Brazil\u2019s fast-paced economy got stuck last year, concerns about the environment dropped down the priority list.And greenhouse gas emissions rose by nearly 8 percent in 2013 compared to the year before.\u201cUntil 2010 we had both high growth and falling emissions,\u201d noted Tasso Azevedo, former director of the Environment Ministry\u2019s National Forest Program and one of the lead designers of Brazil\u2019s plan to combat deforestation. \u201cToday Brazil is in the worst of worlds, emitting more and generating less growth.\u201dBrazil, experts argue, could stop deforestation entirely. \u201cWe could double grain production to 350 million tons without felling any more forest,\u201d said Eduardo Assad of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation. And Brazil\u2019s large ethanol industry still shows enormous promise.But how and when Brazil and other developing countries commit to a low-carbon path will always depend on whether there is enough growth to keep living standards on the rise.\u201cWe have so many tools to turn things around,\u201d Mr. Assad said.The question is whether they will draw the needed investment. \u201cThis could be solved quickly if we can turn around the economic slowdown,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if we can\u2019t overcome the stagnant economy, it\u2019s going to be at a turtle\u2019s pace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goodfortheworld.com", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThings had been running surprisingly smoothly on the \u201cRight to Be Forgotten Google Listening Tour\u201d until Paul Nemitz set foot on the stage in Brussels, its last stop, on Nov. 4.Stung by a European Court of Justice ruling in May that required the search engine to remove, if requested, links to pages containing private information, Google wanted to show the European public that it was not deaf to its very European concerns over privacy. Between September and November, the American Internet giant organized public hearings in seven European Union capitals, where local experts were invited to give their opinion on how the European Court ruling could best be implemented. An independent advisory council (of which I am a member) questioned the experts and will produce a report on the conclusions reached.Given the level of resentment against Google in Europe, I was impressed by the experts\u2019 determination to deal with the issues at stake in depth rather than with the easier political dimension of the debate. With the most vocal critics of Google having generally turned down the invitation to speak, the whole exercise, led by savvy Google officials, was almost disappointingly civilized.Paul Nemitz, who is German but, more importantly, the director for fundamental rights in the European Commission\u2019s justice department, had accepted the invitation. He did not mind speaking at the Brussels gathering. He did not mind complimenting Google for, as he put it, \u201ctaking the lobbying activity public.\u201d And he did not mind asking Google to address the \u201ckey challenge to freedom of speech in societies.\u201d The challenge, Mr. Nemitz pointed out, does not come from the European Court of Justice but from \u201cmass surveillance.\u201d And that, he added, is what the United States National Security Agency is doing.Finally, the elephant in the room was named. Google may have a lot of travails in Europe, from taxes (not enough) to antitrust investigations (too many), but the clash on data protection, which the right to be forgotten epitomizes, has been given new life by Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations of global electronic surveillance programs run by the National Security Agency.So even though, or because, we can\u2019t live without it \u2014 since it commands about 90 percent of the market in the European Union, compared with about 67 percent of the American market \u2014 Google is our favorite villain. The Wall Street Journal calls it \u201cEurope\u2019s Pi\u00f1ata.\u201d Mathias D\u00f6pfner, C.E.O. of Axel Springer, the powerful German media company, claims he is \u201cafraid\u201d of this \u201cdigital superstate.\u201d Arnaud Montebourg, when he was still France\u2019s economy minister, said that he saw a colonialist bent to the American Internet giants\u2019 unfettered power in Europe and felt that it was a threat to our sovereignty.The backlash has hit all members of the GAFA gang (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon), but it\u2019s Google that is taking most of the heat: for being too huge, too dominant, too arrogant and too opaque. Late last month, the European Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution asking for its breakup.This rift is more serious than the Microsoft battle a decade ago. It has exposed deep trans-Atlantic differences that should not be dismissed as mere European angst, jealousy or conservatism. The fact that the United States Federal Trade Commission has not found grounds for legal action against Google doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t any grounds in the European Union: Europeans and Americans have different approaches to monopoly power. By the way, the complaints against Google in Brussels have also been brought by rival American companies like Microsoft, Yelp and TripAdvisor.There are philosophical differences as well. Shortly after Mr. Snowden dropped his bombshell, in June 2013, President Obama visited Berlin. At a joint press conference, Chancellor Angela Merkel described the Internet as \u201cnew territory, uncharted territory to all of us,\u201d stressing that \u201cwe talked at great length about the new possibilities\u201d and also about \u201cthe new threats that the Internet opens up.\u201d\u201cThreat\u201d is a word rarely associated with the Internet in America, where a free web is seen as a tool for spreading liberty: The Internet is a force for good. While happy to use it, Europeans feel uneasy about such a powerful tool being left unregulated. For them, the force for good is the state which, through democratic institutions, is supposed to protect them from threats.Another major difference, obviously, is privacy, which history has taught Europeans to cherish. Is it a coincidence that George Orwell was British, not American? As the debate on the right to be forgotten shows, the great philosophical battle of the Internet, freedom of speech versus privacy, is now underway. So far, Europeans and Americans dissent on how to balance these two fundamental rights. But the amount of de-referencing requests received by Google from European Union users (almost 180,000 since May), with the French and Germans as top requesters, shows that this issue cannot be treated lightly.This is only the beginning. Take a closer look at what Google is working on these days, well beyond Gmail, Google Earth or Google+, and soon our byzantine arguments about whether de-referencing should apply to google.fr, to the 28 European domains, or globally to google.com will look trivial. We are now entering the age of Google Brain, Google X, Calico, biotechnologies and artificial intelligence, in which the Silicon Valley giant is making major investments. This is also uncharted territory. More ethical and philosophical questions will be raised, on which Google and Europeans will probably differ.In a fascinating interview at the end of October with The Financial Times, Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder, was asked whether a private company, rather than governments, should be throwing its weight behind some of the most ambitious science projects. \u201cWell,\u201d he retorted, \u201csomebody\u2019s got to do it.\u201d With $62 billion in cash and equivalents, Google is certainly in a better position than many debt-ridden governments. \u201cHow do we use all these resources ... and have a much more positive impact on the world?\u201d Mr. Page mused.One is left to wonder how Google, beyond \u201cdo no evil,\u201d will decide what is a \u201cpositive impact\u201d for the rest of the world. Will it be the google.com way? In the rest of the world, we have google.fr, google.de, google.sg or google.co.in. There is no google.us: Americans use google.com. And google.com is also good for the rest of the world. But as we now see, it is not so easily one-size-fits-all. Nor goodfortheworld.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Israel, Antitrust Regulator Reviews Natural Gas Development", "Date": "2014-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTogether, Nobel estimates that the Leviathan and Tamar fields hold more than 800 billion cubic meters of gas, enough to meet current Israeli demand for about a century. With such a wealth of gas, the companies and the government are backing plans to also export gas to Israel\u2019s neighbors.Given significant reliance on the gas in Israel, the regulator is objecting to the group\u2019s dominant position over the two fields. One worry is that Noble and its partners could overcharge for the gas, hurting consumers.\u201cThe entry of Delek and Noble into Leviathan has created a situation in which these groups control all the gas reserves on the coast of the state of Israel,\u201d Israel\u2019s antitrust commissioner, David Gilo, said in a statement. Mr. Gilo said he would hold a hearing for the companies before making a decision.A move by the regulator to break up the consortium would lead to further delays on Leviathan, which has already proved difficult to develop. Noble and its partners have spent years trying to find ways to finance the development of Leviathan, whose first phase could cost up to $8 billion.Nati Birenboim, a former adviser to the Israeli minister of energy and water, said he thought it likely that the regulator would try to force Noble and its partners to sell their stakes in Leviathan. Such a move could delay development by at least two or three years, he said, as the companies would most likely bring the decision to the courts and as new developers would have to be found.Israel may also have a tough time finding other developers. While Leviathan represents a significant find, companies may be wary of working in the politically volatile region.Mr. Birenboim, a lawyer who is co-chief executive of the consulting firm Tamuz Group, which advises business on energy matters, said that some officials in the Israeli government were opposed to the decision by the antitrust administrator, which is independent.The shortfall in tax income \u201cis going to cost billions,\u201d Mr. Birenboim said. \u201cWe are sending a very pessimistic message to the business market around the world.\u201dIn his statement, Mr. Gilo said he was aware that his \u201cdetermination could have consequences for the economy.\u201dThe current plan, supported by the United States government, is to sell the gas to Jordan and Egypt through long-term arrangements that could help cement existing peace agreements between Israel and the two Arab countries. The Noble-led group has reached preliminary deals to export substantial quantities of Leviathan gas to Jordan and to liquefied natural gas facilities in Egypt. Changing owners could put these agreements at risk.In an interview with Israel Radio on Tuesday, Gideon Tadmor, the chairman of Delek Drilling and the chief executive of Avner Oil, said that those deals were in Israel\u2019s interest.\u201cWe are in advanced negotiations for signing agreements for export of gas to Jordan, and customers in Egypt, and possible partnership with Cyprus and possible export to Turkey,\u201d Mr. Tadmor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a geopolitical change\u201d for Israel, he added.Shares of Delek Drilling and Avner Oil both fell more than 10 percent in trading in Tel Aviv on Tuesday. Shares in the Delek Group, which controls the two companies, were down about 16.5 percent. All three companies are controlled by the Israeli businessman Yitzhak Tshuva.Noble Energy\u2019s stock was down about 4.4 percent in New York.Mr. Tshuva and Mr. Tadmor teamed up with Noble Energy to begin developing Israel\u2019s gas reserves at the end of the 1990s. The partners have made a series of discoveries including Leviathan, which is one of the largest fields to have been found in recent years. The companies have also discovered gas off Cyprus.Noble owns about 40 percent of Leviathan, and the Delek companies hold about 45 percent. Ratio Oil Exploration owns the remaining portion.The companies already had an agreement with Israel\u2019s antitrust regulator to sell two smaller fields, called Tanin and Karish, to address monopoly concerns. Mr. Gilo of the antitrust commission said he was reconsidering this decision because it \u201cdid not create a real competitive solution to solve the problem of a monopoly in the market.\u201dNoble expressed disappointment with the developments on Tuesday. A decision to reconsider the earlier settlement would \u201ccast a shadow over the future of the oil and gas industry in Israel and will impact Noble Energy\u2019s continued investment there,\u201d Binyamin Zomer, the company\u2019s country manager, said in a statement.Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Against Reform", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s easy to understand why Republicans wish health reform had never happened, and are now hoping that the Supreme Court will abandon its principles and undermine the law. But it\u2019s more puzzling \u2014 and disturbing \u2014 when Democrats like Charles Schumer, senator from New York, declare that the Obama administration\u2019s signature achievement was a mistake.In short, if you think of Obamacare as a policy intended to improve American lives, it\u2019s going really well. Yet it has not, of course, been a political winner for Democrats. Which brings us to Mr. Schumer.The Schumer critique \u2014 he certainly isn\u2019t the first to say these things, but he is the most prominent Democrat to say them \u2014 calls health reform a mistake because it only benefits a minority of Americans, and that\u2019s not enough to win elections. What President Obama should have done, claims Mr. Schumer, was focus on improving the economy as a whole.This is deeply wrongheaded in at least three ways.First, while it\u2019s true that most Americans have insurance through Medicare, Medicaid, and employment-based coverage, that doesn\u2019t mean that only the current uninsured benefit from a program that guarantees affordable care. Maybe you have good coverage now, but what happens if you\u2019re fired, or your employer goes bust, or it cancels its insurance program? What if you want to change jobs for whatever reason, but can\u2019t find a new job that comes with insurance? The point is that the pre-Obamacare system put many Americans at the constant risk of going without insurance, many more than the number of uninsured at any given time, and limited freedom of employment for millions more. So health reform helps a much larger share of the population than those currently uninsured \u2014 and those beneficiaries have relatives and friends. This is not a policy targeted on a small minority.Second, whenever someone says that Mr. Obama should have focused on the economy, my question is, what do you mean by that? Should he have tried for a bigger stimulus? I\u2019d say yes, but that fight took place in the very first months of his administration, before the push for health reform got underway. After that, and especially after 2010, scorched-earth Republican opposition killed just about every economic policy he proposed. Do you think this would have been different without health reform? Seriously?Look, economic management is about substance, not theater. Having the president walk around muttering \u201cI\u2019m focused on the economy\u201d wouldn\u2019t have accomplished anything. And I\u2019ve never seen any plausible explanation of how abandoning health reform would have made any difference at all to the political possibilities for economic policy.Finally, we need to ask, what is the purpose of winning elections? The answer, I hope, is to do good \u2014 not simply to set yourself up to win the next election. In 2009-10, Democrats had their first chance in a generation to do what we should have done three generations ago, and ensure adequate health care for all of our citizens. It would have been incredibly cynical not to have seized that opportunity, and Democrats should be celebrating the fact that they did the right thing.And one related observation: If more Democrats had been willing to defend the best thing they\u2019ve done in decades, rather than run away from their own achievement and implicitly concede that the smears against health reform were right, the politics of the issue might look very different today.

{"Headline": "Amid Tensions with Business Leaders, Obama Details His Agenda", "Date": "2014-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s relations with business leaders have often been terse and frosty. But on Wednesday, Mr. Obama lingered for nearly two hours with the chief executives of several of the largest American companies, rallying their support for an Asian trade deal and laying out his most detailed case yet for corporate tax reform.Speaking to the Business Roundtable, Mr. Obama said he believed there was a narrow path to overhaul the tax code in the next Congress. But he said the effort faced significant obstacles because the White House wanted to focus just on corporate taxes, while Republicans insisted on overhauling both corporate and individual taxes.\u201cThere is definitely a deal to be done,\u201d the president said, adding, \u201cIf we start with the corporate side, it\u2019s a more discrete problem, fewer variables, fewer moving parts.\u201d Republicans, he said, might not yield, \u201cand that could end up being a hang-up.\u201dAddressing an acute concern of the executives, Mr. Obama said he was open to a short-term extension of an array of personal and business tax breaks that are to expire Jan. 1, but only if it were part of a package that included other measures, like the child tax credit and earned-income tax credit, which benefit middle-income families.The president had threatened to veto a deal negotiated between the House Republican leadership and the departing Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, which would have made those tax breaks permanent. Administration officials said it favored wealthy corporate interests at the expense of working families.Pressed by the executives, Mr. Obama listed his economic priorities for the remainder of his presidency as tax reform, immigration, trade, and investment in infrastructure. Taxes, he said, should come first because it will take at least six to nine months to negotiate legislation.That message appeared to resonate with the executives. Randall L. Stephenson, the chairman of the Business Roundtable and the chief executive of AT&T, said, \u201cI was encouraged by the president\u2019s remarks and what we heard from Republican leaders yesterday.\u201d Extending the tax breaks and approving a budget, he said, \u201cwould be a good start.\u201dMr. Obama also stressed his determination to complete negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country trade agreement that is a centerpiece of the president\u2019s strategic shift to Asia. Selling the pact at home, he said, will be just as important as negotiating it, and he was clearly seeking allies among the business executives.\u201cSome of the criticism of what we\u2019ve been doing on the Trans-Pacific Partnership is groups fighting the last war as opposed to looking forward,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The president recently returned from a trip to Asia, where he attended a meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized economies, and he was eager to promote the relative strength of the United States economy versus those of Japan and major European countries. Japan, Mr. Obama said, has fallen into a slump so severe that it has surprised analysts, as well as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Europe, he said, is grappling with chronically weak demand and the danger of a deflationary spiral. And China is in the midst of a complicated transition from an export-led economy to one fueled more by domestic demand.Mr. Obama was far less sanguine about geopolitical issues. In a long answer that amounted to a tour of the world\u2019s hot spots, he said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was \u201cimprovising himself into a nationalist, backward-looking approach to Russian policy that is scaring the heck out of his neighbors and is badly damaging his economy.\u201dWhile the president expressed confidence that an American-led military campaign would reverse the gains of the Islamic State militant group in Iraq, he offered a dark analysis of the situation in neighboring Syria. There, he said, the nearly four-year civil war between rebels and President Bashar al-Assad is a major hurdle to rooting out the militants.\u201cIt may take time to let that thing settle down,\u201d he said, noting that the \u201cinterests of outside parties are so conflicting.\u201d Though Mr. Obama did not mention it, the United States has refused to agree to Turkey\u2019s demands for a no-fly zone over Syria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Water Source for Almonds in California May Run Dry", "Date": "2014-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySACRAMENTO \u2014 California\u2019s almond orchards have been thriving over the past decade and now provide an $11 billion annual boost to the state economy. Covering 860,000 acres, they account for 80 percent of world production. But the growth coincides with another record development here \u2014 drought \u2014 and the extensive water needs of nut trees are posing a sharp challenge to state water policy.Farmers in the area where almond production has been most consistent have relied on water from a federally controlled project that draws its supply largely from the Sacramento River. But that source is less reliable because of legal requirements that in a time of scarcity, waterways that nurture California salmon must also get available water flows. Growers, some very wealthy, tried to get Congress to change those rules but failed. Also, new state groundwater legislation may eventually constrain farmers\u2019 well drilling.Almonds \u201chave totally changed the game of water in California,\u201d said Antonio Rossmann, a Berkeley lawyer specializing in water issues. \u201cIt\u2019s hardened demand in the Central Valley.\u201dFarmers are planting almonds because, as permanent crops, they do not need to be replanted after every harvest. They have been steadily taking over from cotton and lettuce because they are more lucrative. \u201cThat\u2019s the highest and best use of the land,\u201d said Ryan Metzler, 45, who grows almonds near Fresno.The problem is that not only do almonds and pistachios, another newly popular nut, need more water, but the farmers choosing permanent crops cannot fallow them in a dry year without losing years of investment.Now the state is putting new controls on the groundwater that has gotten many farmers through the brutal drought \u2014 which still looms over the state, despite recent rains \u2014 and there is no certainty that the future of almond and pistachio orchards in areas like the western San Joaquin Valley is secure.So almond growers are determined to be granted the water they need to keep their crops from dying, particularly in the Westlands Water District in the San Joaquin Valley, where 15 percent of the fields are covered with almond trees, up from 5 percent about 15 years ago. They chafe at the rise in the 1990s of environmental restrictions designed to help the survival of salmon species threatened by two generations of water diversions.\u201cWe\u2019ve had 20 years of a regulatory approach that has not improved the fishery,\u201d said Jason Peltier, the chief deputy general manager of the Westlands Water District, which serves some of the richest growers in the state. \u201cThe reality is that their regulatory methods have failed on every measure\u201d of the health of salmon species. His hope for the next Congress is that \u201cthey will take a look at the social and economic damage that the regulatory environment has created\u201dThe assertion that environmental laws hurt farmers and farm laborers has proliferated during three years of searing drought, when federal water allocations were almost completely cut off. The claims infuriate opponents who feel that satisfying Westlands\u2019 demands would hurt other more valid claimants. \u201cThey are hurting other farmers, people, communities and industries,\u201d said Representative Jared Huffman, a Democrat whose district along the north coast includes many fishing interests. \u201cThere are big-time winners and big-time losers here.\u201dThe proposals in the failed legislation \u2014 which was sponsored by Representative David Valadao, Republican of Hanford, in the southern San Joaquin Valley agricultural heartland \u2014 \u201cwould upend a whole number of laws\u201d and long-established priority rights to surface water, said Kate Poole, a water expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council.She added, \u201cWe have clearly exceeded the ability of our water supplies \u2014 including surface and groundwater \u2014 to meet the demands we\u2019re putting on it. We have to change, stretching how much we can get out of each drop through expanded urban and agricultural efficiency.\u201d But, she said, \u201cthe Republicans in Congress seem to want to go in the other direction and upend the centuries-old priorities and give water to more politically powerful wealthy interests.\u201dAlmonds are thriving not just in the western San Joaquin Valley, but across the state. Dino Giacomazzi, a fourth-generation dairy farmer in Hanford, is changing the makeup of his land. About 40 percent of his acreage \u2014 currently used for pasture or for alfalfa and other crops to feed cows \u2014 is being converted to almond fields. Almond trees are far more difficult to plant than field crops like alfalfa, Mr. Giacomazzi said. \u201cIt takes 40 guys a day to do 20 to 40 acres\u201d of almonds. One man plus a tractor can plant 100 acres of alfalfa, he said. The diversity of agricultural efforts will make his business more secure, he believes. \u201cThe trees and dairy can support each other at different times,\u201d he added.A new almond farmer to the north is Shane Tucker, who is 54 and started out in the business of financing agricultural enterprises.

Growers in the drier parts of the San Joaquin Valley use federal or state water projects that date to the mid-20th century.

{"Headline": "As the Ruble Swoons, Russians Desperately Shop", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia faced a snowballing currency crisis on Tuesday that prompted an unusual outburst of public bickering among some top presidential allies, as President Vladimir V. Putin struggled to tame events that had the potential to wreck his reputation as the leader who brought stability and prosperity to this country.Even a middle-of-the-night increase in interest rates to 17 percent failed to reverse the slide of the ruble, as panicked investors drove the currency past 80 to the dollar, a historic low, before it rebounded late in the day to 68. The ruble has lost 50 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. Russian consumers afraid of losing their savings, as happened in a financial crisis in 1998, flooded stores, rushing to dump rubles that seemed to shrink in worth by the minute.The economy was not yet in danger of freezing in a liquidity crisis, economists and other analysts noted, nor was Russia as yet facing a repeat of 1998, when the government could not pay its debts. But many acknowledged that a financial crisis could develop at lightning speed if global markets that already distrust the Kremlin lost confidence in its ability to contain the damage. Mr. Rogov said that his own family members had been forced to give up their usual Alpine ski vacation this year because of the expense, and might choose Georgia or Chechnya instead.The crisis has been driven by a sharp decline in the price of oil, the country\u2019s main export, investors\u2019 loss of confidence in the government and a confrontational foreign policy that yielded Western economic sanctions after the Ukraine crisis \u2014 factors that analysts said were unlikely to change soon.A similar run on the ruble in 2009 halted abruptly after the central bank raised interest rates to 13 percent, causing a steep recession with an 8 percent drop in growth but halting the panic. Oil prices also rebounded quickly that year. This year, the interest rate increase seemed only to scare investors, confirming their fears that the government does not know how to handle the crisis. \u201cThe main impression is a picture of weakness as the government does not know what to do,\u201d Mr. Rogov said. \u201cIt cannot stop the panic, it cannot stop the devaluation.\u201dThere were no signs of a broad public panic, no lines at banks or money exchange points. But that might have been because some of them were charging as much as 100 rubles per dollar. (News reports suggested that there might be a run on new signs for exchange shops because the current ones are designed for two digits, not three.)Given the level of corruption and bribery here, not to mention the congenital distrust of state institutions, in normal times all manner of Russians stow rubles at home. Now, most are anxious to dispose of those stashes any way they can. One Kazakh man was seen walking around a Jaguar dealership, which like several luxury brands had run out of cars, with a little rolling suitcase full of cash. Sales were up 50 percent this month, a manager said.Young urban professionals in Moscow earn roughly 80,000 rubles a month on average. Before the crisis, that was worth $2,500, plenty of money for them to meet basic living expenses and enough to still spend free time in Europe. As of Tuesday, those salaries had dwindled to around $1,000, leaving those who had already bought airplane tickets wondering how to pay for the rest of the vacation.At the Apple store in the AviaPark mall, Sergey Akimov, a 22-year-old technology worker, said his dreams of foreign travel had evaporated, so he was spending the money on a new iPhone 6, selling in rubles for considerably less than its American price of $650 because of the rapidly depreciating exchange rate. \u201cThis is instead of my vacation,\u201d he said, smiling. The store raised prices during the day as the currency slid.As always, many Russians responded to the crisis with stoicism and some dark humor. \u201cIf you could change anything about your past, what would it be?\u201d went one joke. \u201cRubles\u201d was the response.Mr. Putin did not comment publicly on Tuesday, although he is scheduled to hold his marathon annual news conference on Thursday. Much of the official debate swirled around demands for the resignation of Elvira Nabiullina, the chairwoman of the central bank. One Communist deputy in parliament accused her of deliberate \u201csabotage,\u201d an old Stalinist favorite.State-run television, reflecting the Kremlin point of view, focused much of its substantial coverage on explaining why the central bank was doing the right thing. For her part, Ms. Nabiullina explained that Russia had to get used to living within its means.\u201cWe have to learn to live in a different zone, to orient ourselves more towards our own sources of financing, projects and to give a chance to import substitution,\u201d she said on Russian television.While a weak currency generally invites investment over the long run, foreign investors have grown leery of the Russian market because of the culture of crony capitalism surrounding Mr. Putin and his inner circle, and the perception that they bend the rules to suit their purposes. Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former finance minister who has been mentioned as a possible new prime minister to address the crisis, wrote on Twitter that \u201cthe fall of the ruble and the stock market is not just a reaction to the low price of oil and to sanctions, but also due to a lack of confidence in the government\u2019s economic policy.\u201dWith Rosneft unable to refinance debt because of Western sanctions restricting business with Russia, it turned to the central bank, which agreed to an opaque deal that, to the markets, appeared as if the central bank had simply printed rubles to prop up the company. The ruble\u2019s slide, Mr. Kudrin said, began after the deal was announced.Mr. Sechin called Mr. Kudrin\u2019s suggestion that the deal prompted the sell-off \u201ca provocation\u201d and denied that any rubles borrowed by the company on Friday had been converted into hard currency.Kremlin supporters, and they are legion, blamed Washington for the entire crisis, saying it was conspiring with the Saudis to bring down the price of oil and wreck the Russian economy in an attempt to overthrow Mr. Putin. Oil constitutes more than 60 percent of Russian exports.\u201cThe ruble decline is a result of the financial war that Washington called against Moscow, a hybrid war,\u201d said Sergei Markov, a political analyst close to the Kremlin. Even he conceded that it would be a challenge for Mr. Putin to maintain his popularity in the face of falling living standards after overseeing nearly 15 years of prosperity. Mr. Putin has based his political appeal on the promise of broadly shared prosperity and a rebuilt sense of national pride, both of which are threatened by the recent economic reversals. Nevertheless, both supporters and the president\u2019s opponents said it was far too soon to assess any long-term political impact.Further economic turmoil surely lies ahead, with much of the debate focused on how deep a recession will be. Many analysts suggested that Russia could soon impose currency controls to exert more government supervision over the import and export of dollars.Russian companies, including many of the state-run giants, owe some $650 billion to Western banks that they cannot refinance because of sanctions. Russia cannot pay with its reserves, estimated at a maximum of $400 billion, but probably far less than that, after accounting for all obligations. In the past, Russia has turned to the International Monetary Fund for help, but that would be a blow to Mr. Putin\u2019s stated goal of preserving Russia as a strong, independent entity. Some of the companies that must repay a total of $130 billion in foreign debt next year are run by longtime associates of Mr. Putin, and if printing rubles is the bailout plan for them, the ruble may be in for even greater trouble.Andrew Roth, Alexandra Odynova and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Destined for the Junkyard, but Not Until the Race Is Over ", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelspinSEBRING, FLA. \u2014 George Neill wanted to race his 1973 Porsche 914 at Sebring in the worst way possible. And that\u2019s exactly what he did. In September, he entered a 14-hour endurance race with his Porsche, an $800 Craigslist find whose engine produced 76 horsepower, at best, when it was new four decades ago. With hopes of enticing the tire maker Falken to give him free samples, he called his entry Team Falken Awesome, which didn\u2019t help the car go any faster or farther. On the fifth lap, a dead cylinder sent the car to the pits for a two-hour repair. Once back on the track, it took less than a lap for the clutch to explode into what he described as \u201ca billion pieces.\u201d Another two-hour pit stop had the team racing again, now four hours behind the competitors. Mr. Neill never got any free tires. In most races, curses would be flying and towels thrown in, but the mood in the Team Falken Awesome pit was resolutely cheerful, with team members joking that it was all a plan to get the breakdowns out of the way early. \u201cOur strategy is to wait for everyone else to blow up, then sail to the checkered flag,\u201d a co-driver, John Faure, said.That\u2019s often the tenor at a ChumpCar World Series event, where for most competitors winning is second to getting as much track time as possible while spending as little money as possible. ChumpCar positions itself as a back-to -the-roots racing series, recalling an era when shade-tree mechanics and would-be Andrettis could, with little investment, take their everyday Pontiacs and MGs to a track. A notion revived by the 24 Hours of LeMons and others, it has gained a devoted following.ChumpCar enforces economy by penalizing cars deemed to be worth more than $500 or one that use nonstock parts. Unlike organizations like the Sports Car Club of America and National Auto Sports Association, ChumpCar drivers need no special training or licensing, lowering the barrier further yet.The result is that ChumpCar, with nearly four dozen endurance races in 2014 (and two sprint races), has become North America\u2019s largest endurance road racing series in just five years, said its founder, John Condren, a man known for his sometimes Barnumesque brio.ChumpCars may not have mannequins on the roof like some LeMons cars, but a ChumpCar race is not a sullen event. Teams take names like Formula None Racing, Passing Gas, Turn 1 Trailer Trash and Beerios. Fanciful paint jobs make most look far better than a $500 junker should. There is a practical side to pristine paint, said Mr. Neill, whose Porsche was partly covered with lime green plastic tool dip. \u201cIf it comes back into the pit with a big dent in it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know who put it there.\u201d The unwritten rule is a team member who damages a car pays for its repair.All a first-time ChumpCar driver needs is a valid driver\u2019s license and to attend a lighthearted rookie meeting where racing basics are described. Michael Chisek, ChumpCar\u2019s regional director, explained the basics of on-track safety. \u201cDo not get out of the car,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe exception \u2014 your car is on fire.\u201d There were rules on passing, how much contact is allowed and an explanation of the flag signaling system. The lack of licensing has been questioned by some organizations that require it. 15 Photos\u201cThis sport is a privilege. It\u2019s amazingly fun, but it\u2019s an extreme sport,\u201d said Ryan Flaherty, national director of the National Auto Sport Association, which has a strict training and licensing system. \u201dYou don\u2019t begin any extreme sport with the most dangerous and difficult activity of that sport.\u201d One might expect a track crowded with neophyte leadfoots to frighten off more accomplished drivers, but some professionals have been drawn to ChumpCar.Ken Schrader, a 30-year Nascar veteran, has raced the series and said he found it no riskier than professional races. \u201cYou are not running 190 miles for hours in an open-wheel car or inches from a concrete wall,\u201d he said. And with tire barriers and track runoffs, Chump events have more safety features than many pro races, he said. Bobby Labonte, who has won 21 Nascar Sprint Cup races, has run ChumpCar races.\u201cIt\u2019s just fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t pressure like you\u2019d experience on the weekend of a Sprint Cup race.\u201d Racing a Ford Crown Victoria painted like a police car, Labonte\u2019s co-drivers include his son and the North Carolina district court judge who owns the car. \u201cWithout spending too much money we are just having a great time together,\u201d Labonte said.Mr. Condren, ChumpCar\u2019s chief executive, calls himself the Chief Chump. He argues that making it easier to compete has opened racing to groups that don\u2019t have much of a presence in motor sports, like women, whom he said make up 14 percent of ChumpCar competitors. Part of the reason may be how easy it is to join, said Clarice Lee, who is also a NASA licensed racer. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intimidating,\u201d she said. While the rules call for a $500 car, they also call for safety equipment that costs about $1,500 \u2014 a roll cage as well as a helmet and fire-resistant driving suit. Teams typically spend more. \u201cYou spend between $15,000 and $25,000 to build the car,\u201d said Eddie Grover, whose Dodge Neon is painted pink as a tribute to his wife, Michelle, a breast cancer survivor. \u201cThe seat in this car is $1,500 on its own.\u201d Because reliability is so critical in endurance races that may last more than 30 hours, some teams, according to the buzz in the pits, rebuild their entire cars with new stock parts. That tendency is damped by the fact that there is no prize money, just credit toward future race fees and artful trophies made of broken parts that racers toss in a communal bucket.There are even less expensive options, generally grouped under \u201crenting a seat,\u201d which can be with a team needing a driver, or with a professional ChumpCar rental outfit. In a section of ChumpCar\u2019s website forum called the Connection, teams advertise open seats. Some offer to split expenses equally among drivers, and others have set fees, such as $400 for two hours and $100 for each additional hour. Operations like No Mo Money Race Engineering will outfit four to five drivers with a Miata, fuel, tires, entry fees and a pit crew for $1,200 to $1,800 per driver. Aspiring racers pay for travel and housing and, potentially, for repairs. Paul Kullman, the owner of the rental company, made one point clear: \u201cDamage is on you.\u201dAs ChumpCar continues to add rules to keep the playing field even, it risks becoming more like the very organizations it is the alternative to. After all, NASA and the S.C.C.A. themselves started as racing for Everyman.The easygoing Mr. Neill of Team Falken Awesome summed up the challenge. \u201cThe closer you get to the podium, the more time and more money it takes,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you going to continue to have fun having cars passing you by 45 m.p.h? I could for a while. But eventually you want to pass other cars.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Defines the Next Economic Giants?", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsTurning Point: Investors retreat from emerging marketsWhat actually constitutes an economic giant?We all know that the United States is one \u2014 its economy still makes up some 20 percent of global gross domestic product despite a modest relative decline in recent years. But who else? And does the word \u201cgiant\u201d refer only to economic size, or should it also be reflective of a country\u2019s wealth, its people\u2019s prosperity and other measures of their lifestyle \u2014 perhaps even their freedoms?It isn\u2019t easy to make simple distinctions, other than for the United States, which on virtually all criteria is easily at the top of such a group, and looking into the future \u2014 at least the next 20 to 30 years \u2014 seems set to remain so.A country\u2019s economic size is essentially driven by two long-term forces: the nation\u2019s workforce in terms of the number of people able and eligible to work, and its productivity.The size of the workforce is mostly driven by the country\u2019s demographics, although its immigration policies, its stance on when young people can begin work and its retirement age all have an influence. So by and large, the world\u2019s largest economies tend to be found in places where there are a lot of people. In the developed world, the United States has the biggest economy, mostly because it has the most people, and it will dominate over the rest of the countries currently thought to be \u201cdeveloped\u201d for decades to come. Unless of course the euro area becomes a \u201ccountry.\u201dOn the list of the top 20 largest economies in the world, most have large populations. From the developed world, Japan (No. 3), Germany, France, Britain and Italy all sit among the top 10, although their relative ranking has slipped in the past decade as China, Brazil and Russia have entered this group. Over the remainder of this decade, Italy might find it a challenge to remain in the top 10, and going into the 2021-30 decade, the other so-called developed economies outside of the United States will, too.While Japan and Germany\u2019s economies might be considered very large by developed country standards, these countries are not economic giants. China has the second-largest economy in the world; it has become almost twice the size of Japan\u2019s and is actually now bigger than Germany\u2019s, France\u2019s and Italy\u2019s combined.Is China a giant? If it doesn\u2019t have a gargantuan economy already, it is certainly headed in that direction.In addition to being as big as continental Europe\u2019s three largest economies put together, China\u2019s economy is about 55 percent the size of the United States\u2019 in current U.S. dollars, and based on recent estimates from the World Bank International Comparison Program, it is probably slightly bigger than the United States\u2019 in purchasing power parity terms.It is also, in U.S.-dollar terms, one and a half times the size of the other three so-called BRIC economies combined (Brazil, Russia, India and China), and if its growth continues in the 7-7.5 percent vicinity, with inflation around 3 percent and the value of its renminbi stable to modestly rising, it is adding another $1 trillion to global GDP every year. I often point out to people that China is adding another India to the world economy every two years.Still, it seems to me that although China\u2019s current wealth is in the $7,000-$8,000 per capita vicinity because of its 1.3 billion people, which is multiples lower than that of the United States and other developed economies, China should be considered a giant. It is the only one of the four BRIC economies that continues to match my previous expectations and forecasts.In the path to 2050, where with colleagues I first highlighted the dramatic potential of the BRIC economies, I assumed that China\u2019s economy would grow by around 7.5 percent this decade. The last time I updated my assumptions was in 2010, and so far this decade, it has grown by 8.2 percent \u2014 more than I had assumed. While its growth rate has slowed, and is likely to slow further, I still believe that sometime around 2025-27, China\u2019s economy has a reasonable chance of becoming as large as the United States\u2019 in U.S.-dollar terms. It is already the major trading partner for many countries \u2014 both exports and imports \u2014 and I would expect that before this decade is over, possibly quite a bit before, China will replace the United States as the world\u2019s largest importer. From the rest of the world\u2019s perspective, China will certainly be an economic giant then.Many people talk about how disappointing China has been as an investment, but this is not completely true. While the most popular Chinese stock indexes have underperformed other major indexes, some Chinese markets like the Shenzhen have done well. Investors need to focus on the \u201cnew\u201d China and avoid the \u201cold\u201d China, choosing investments in the Chinese consumer and new and alternative energies and technologies instead of the low-valued manufacturing and commodity-guzzling companies of the past.What about the other BRIC countries? Some years after I first coined the acronym in 2001, I suggested that a BRIC economy should be regarded as one that was already producing or had the clear potential to produce 5 percent of global GDP or more. China\u2019s is the only one that qualifies, but at the time I believed that the other three BRIC economies had that potential.Today, the economies of Brazil, India and Russia are all generating around 3 percent of global GDP, similar to Italy. But the countries\u2019 big populations and reforms to lift productivity still mean their economies have a reasonable chance of going above that 5 percent threshold. They may someday become giants.At the time of writing, I am quite confident that India will make this leap \u2014 its economy has a really good chance of becoming the world\u2019s third-largest before 2040. The country has exceptionally favorable demographics, and in electing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has given itself the best chance in at least 30 years of being run by a government that is not smothered by its democracy but flourishes instead. The stock market has taken note, and I would expect a continued positive repricing of Indian investments.Brazil and Russia\u2019s economies have different reasons for their recent disappointments, but they share a common dilemma: They are too dependent on volatile commodities. Unless they can shift away from that dependency, their paths will remain volatile, influenced by the vagaries of commodity prices.Brazil\u2019s economy in particular needs to change course, whatever the country\u2019s political leadership. The government has to create incentives and room for much more private sector investment and it needs to stop using directives to run so much of the economy.With reforms, both Brazil and Russia could generate more than 5 percent of global GDP.Of the rest of the world\u2019s largest populated countries, I believe none has a realistic chance of producing 5 percent of global GDP or more, but there are a few that could reach the 3-5 percent range, or more than Italy, which currently has the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy. Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey \u2014 the so-called MINT economies \u2014 along with the more developed South Korea, have this chance. Mexico in some ways is going to be especially interesting to watch for the rest of this decade, since the scale of reforms undertaken by its government are vast \u2014 they should help boost the growth rate considerably compared to the economy\u2019s meager performance of the past 20 years or more.Creating a more competitive energy industry with cheaper electricity costs might not solve all the country\u2019s problems, but many parts of the economy should benefit.I have traveled quite often to all four MINT nations in the past 12 months, and while they have many challenges, they all have exciting potential, and could become mini-giants, if not quite on the scale of some of their well-known BRIC colleagues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Economist Goes Christmas Shopping", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byObject Lessons\u201cThe Deadweight Loss of Christmas\u201d is the sort of academic paper that makes ordinary people think economists are kind of crazy.\"I find that holiday gift giving destroys between one-third and one-tenth of the value of gifts,\u201d proclaimed Joel Waldfogel, then an economics professor at Yale, in the 1993 paper. He estimated that ill-chosen gifts caused between $4 billion and $13 billion a year in economic waste; for comparison, he cited an estimate that put economic costs of the income tax at $50 billion.This is the sort of provocation economists love: It rejects a beloved, sentimental tradition and devalues interpersonal interaction, while upholding the virtue of individual choice. After all, why should you shop for me, when I certainly know what I want better than you do? It\u2019s no surprise that Mr. Waldfogel\u2019s paper, \u201cThe Deadweight Loss of Christmas,\u201d was published in The American Economic Review, one of the world\u2019s top three economics journals.But one thing I learned from growing up around economists is they do not always live up to their provocations. For example, my economist father, who taught me as a young child that voting is irrational because your odds of affecting the electoral outcome are infinitesimal, votes. And Mr. Waldfogel, who went on to write a book called \u201cScroogenomics: Why You Shouldn\u2019t Buy Presents for the Holidays,\u201d actually does buy presents at the holidays, at least for some people.\u201cWhen I know people well, I choose gifts for them,\u201d Mr. Waldfogel told me. \u201cI know my family well.\u201dThat puts Mr. Waldfogel in line with most economists: Last year, members of the IGM Experts Panel at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business overwhelmingly defended gift-giving as an efficient way for people to show that they care about each other.David Autor of M.I.T. pointed to \u201crevealed preference\u201d: If people give and receive so many gifts, it\u2019s presumably because it makes them happy. Alberto Alesina of Harvard said choosing a gift \u201cis a signal of intensity of search effort,\u201d which is econo-speak for \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts.\u201dSince it\u2019s almost Christmas, I called up the economist I know best to get his perspective on gift giving: My father, an economics professor at Harvard. My dad says his approach to gifts is to try to buy something that the recipient didn\u2019t know he or she wanted. And the Robert Barro record on this is instructive, because it is mixed.Sometimes there are big hits: This Christmas he found a book of John Wesley sermons published in 1825, a perfect gift for his wife, Rachel, who is deeply interested in the history of Methodism, but most likely would not have found the item herself.On the other hand, let\u2019s evaluate the box of fancy chocolates he and Rachel sent me for Christmas this year.There are three ways to evaluate this gift. The first level of analysis is that I\u2019m on a diet and certainly would not have bought the chocolate myself, which suggests this was an example of what Mr. Waldfogel warned us about: gift mismatch leading to deadweight loss.The second level of analysis is that I\u2019ve already eaten half the box, which demonstrates my revealed preference for chocolate, and shows my father achieved exactly what he set out to do: He identified an item I would not have bought for myself but apparently wanted.The third level of analysis considers the fact that I now feel I should not have eaten the chocolates, or at least not so many of them in two days. Behavioral economists call this phenomenon \u201chyperbolic discounting\u201d: we overrate the value of immediate pleasures compared to delayed ones, and may do things today (like eat half a box of truffles) that we would have said yesterday we wouldn\u2019t do and will say tomorrow that we should not have done.My father, who is not a behavioral economist, would surely reject this last analysis and say if I ate the chocolates, that must have been the rational thing for me to do; therefore, the chocolates were a great gift.In fairness to Mr. Waldfogel, a lot of gift-giving occurs between people who don\u2019t know each other as well as my dad and I do, and a key point of his paper was that not all gifts are created equal. He made his estimates by surveying Yale students about how much they valued the gifts they got at the holidays, compared with those gifts\u2019 actual purchase prices. Friends and significant others were pretty good at giving gifts the recipients actually liked; it was aunts, uncles and grandparents who bought the least-loved items.The real drag on the economy then isn\u2019t gifts; it\u2019s bad gifts. And Mr. Waldfogel cheers the rise of the gift card as a substitute for the bad gift: Something you can buy your niece or grandson when you have no idea what they actually like.\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about gift cards is that they are a lot like cash but have emerged as a way to give the choice to the recipient without the ickiness of cash,\u201d he says. In other words, the deadweight loss problem he identified in 1993 may be on the wane because of a technological advance.It\u2019s true that Americans have taken to gift cards: CEB TowerGroup, a research firm that tracks gift card sales, says they grew at a more than 10 percent annual pace through much of the first decade of the century. According to CEB data, Americans will load $126 billion onto gift cards in 2014, or almost 1 percent of G.D.P.But not all economists agree that this is a valuable technological advance.\u201cIt seems clear to me that a gift certificate is inferior to money,\u201d says my dad. Which means there is more chocolate in my future.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of economic losses resulting from ill-chosen Christmas gifts as estimated in a paper by the economist Joel Waldfogel. The estimated losses were between $4 billion and $13 billion as of 1993. That implied a loss one-tenth to one-quarter the size of economic losses due to income tax, not \u201cas large\u201d as the income tax.Josh Barro is\na domestic\ncorrespondent\nfor The New\nYork Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charting a Crazy 24 Hours in Global Markets", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket TurmoilIt has been a hairy 24 hours in global financial markets, particularly for anyone who works in the oil business or has a stake in the health of Russia\u2019s economy. But what is really going on, and what does it mean for the United States?The initial results were promising, with a brief uptick in the value of the ruble. But it didn\u2019t last. After falling about 11 percent Monday, the ruble was down a further 10 percent against the dollar early Tuesday, before rebounding to be down 6 percent around noon Eastern time, 8 p.m. in Moscow.The central reason for the sell-off is a collapse since the summer in the price of oil, Russia\u2019s leading export. Not helping matters: the geopolitical uncertainty created by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression toward neighboring Ukraine and the resulting international sanctions that have made businesses and investors wary of Russia.Russia is stuck in a vicious cycle in which falling oil prices worsen its financial position, which causes a loss of confidence in the ruble. A falling ruble causes high inflation and makes businesses reluctant to invest, and the central bank\u2019s interest rate increase to combat the falling ruble will have a side effect of worsening the economy further.A simultaneous sell-off of Russian bonds, stocks and currencies on Tuesday suggested global investors think it will all end in tears, perhaps with capital controls restricting the ability to move money out of the country, or perhaps even a debt default like the one Russia experienced in 1998.The stock market has been relatively stable in both the United States and Europe, suggesting that investors don\u2019t see the troubles in Russia and the continued sell-off in oil affecting corporate profits in the West very much. But things are more interesting in the bond market.Falling oil prices mean lower inflation. And Russia\u2019s troubles could presage more geopolitical instability. Both these things make United States Treasury bonds (and other safe assets) look more attractive. Sure enough, investors have plowed money into bonds, pushing down their yields.It reflects a trend that has been underway throughout 2014. Even as the American economy has performed well, and the Federal Reserve has moved toward an era of tighter money, the nation\u2019s longer-term interest rates have been inexorably dropping. This decline reflects both falling global inflation (caused by weak global growth and falling oil prices), and the desire among global investors to put money somewhere safe.The United States benefits from a paradox: The two things that are driving volatility in global markets right now are both likely to provide a lift for American consumers. Cheaper oil means cheaper gasoline and heating oil. And the boom in Treasury bonds will mean lower mortgage rates. So as hard as this moment is for the Russian economy, there\u2019s little reason to think the United States economy is in imminent danger. Europe has more to lose, with its deeper trade ties to Russia, but that is only one in a long list of Europe\u2019s economic challenges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sensing a Deal on Sanctions, Iran Is Bullish", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 The text message, received as the deadline for nuclear talks was expiring, gave Fatemeh Moghimi a thrill she had been waiting years to feel. \u201cThe deal,\u201d it read, \u201cwas done.\u201dIt took Ms. Moghimi, the owner of a leading trucking company, a second to absorb the news. When she did, she recalled recently in her Tehran office, she fairly screamed to herself, \u201cWe\u2019re in business!\u201dMs. Moghimi\u2019s unyielding optimism, shared by many top businesspeople here, was dented briefly last month when nuclear negotiators agreed to a second extension of the talks without even a framework for further negotiations. But it is almost an article of faith in business circles that the latest extension is only the postponement of an inevitable thaw between Iran and the rest of the world.\u201cThe world needs this deal; we need this deal,\u201d Ms. Moghimi said. \u201cIt will happen.\u201dBoth moderates and conservatives have expressed concerns about the unchecked rise in expectations, among the public as well as among elite business classes, that a deal will be cinched. They have been warning that the enthusiasm could turn to bitter disappointment if the negotiations, set to resume in Geneva next week, should fail, possibly touching off unrest or what some clerics call \u201canother sedition,\u201d a reference to the revolt that followed disputed presidential elections in 2009.\u201cThe prospect of a better future is enough to make them forget their problems for now,\u201d said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst. \u201cLater, we will see if that state of mind will prove to be costly for us.\u201dThe confidence is beginning to take on a life of its own, with executives in the major export industries \u2014 oil and gas, transportation and carpets \u2014 feverishly preparing for what they envision as gloriously prosperous days ahead. Meeting with foreign businesspeople at the conferences that are springing up regularly in Tehran, they are knocking out memorandums of understanding and other nonbinding agreements and even some contracts \u2014 all with caveats saying sanctions must be lifted first.\u201cI have signed contracts with Europeans and Arabs to design five refineries,\u201d said Mohammad Javad Hassannejad, the chief executive of an oil and gas consultancy, Petrosadian. He said the contracts were potentially worth many millions of dollars for his company and would inject billions of dollars into the stagnant Iranian economy.\u201cSpirits are high,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is growing confidence. After the deal we will witness an unbelievable boom.\u201dIn the coming months Tehran\u2019s Chamber of Commerce is organizing an international conference for foreign investors, Ms. Moghimi explained between phone calls, sitting behind her desk.\u201cWe will inform them where and how foreigners can invest, and help them to come to Iran,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of us here are ready to start working.\u201dWhen Ms. Moghimi thinks of Iran\u2019s future she sees a thriving nation at the heart of the crossroads between Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Her fleet of trucks will grow beyond imagination, she said, and she predicted that foreign companies would choose not the glitter of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, but the future boomtown Tehran for their regional headquarters.\u201cWe should start preparing now,\u201d she said in her Tehran office, where framed certificates and awards line the walls. \u201cThat way we will be ready once there is an end to the sanctions.\u201dWhether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.The wave of optimism began with the election of a moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, who promised to mend Iran\u2019s ties with the world. Mr. Rouhani continues to encourage that thinking, saying just last week that the \u201cnuclear issue would be brought to its destination.\u201d His foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, promised after the most recent extension that a nuclear deal could happen \u201cwithin weeks.\u201dThe heightened expectations are not solely to be found among Iranians. The flow of foreign delegations to Iran continues at a steady pace, bringing eager businessmen who in conferences laud Iran\u2019s unique geographical position, its stability and its largely untapped market of middle-class consumers.At one such conference recently, staring into a huge auditorium filled with proudly smiling Iranian car industry representatives, a French executive acknowledged that the potential for business with Iran was stunning indeed. He and the others had just viewed a 3-D movie showing workers in blue overalls manning robots in the Iran Khodro factory, which churns out hundreds of thousands of cars each year.\u201cThe sooner we can start working together, the better,\u201d said the executive, Arnaud de David-Beauregards. He added, almost wistfully, \u201cWe hope our dear colleagues will wait for us.\u201dIran\u2019s national carmaker, partly state owned, feels like the cutest girl in the bar. The industry is being showcased by the Iranian government as a symbol of Iranian potential, a treasure to be sold off to the highest-bidding foreign partner.Even though sanctions have cut the carmaker\u2019s production by 40 percent compared with its peak year of 2011, when it made 1.6 million, hopes are soaring. \u201cWe are planning our future irrespective of any deadline,\u201d said Hashem Yekehzare, the president of Iran Khodro, while making his way through a swarm of journalists.For over a decade his company had partnered with the French automaker PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn under a deal worth more than $2.5 billion a year, but the French were forced to pull out in 2012 because of the American-led sanctions.They are eager to return, but Mr. Yekehzare said the company now had a bevy of suitors to choose from. \u201cGeneral Motors, Ford, all big American carmakers are showing interest in cooperating with us,\u201d he said. \u201cOur future is bright.\u201dThe optimism about the future stands in stark contrast to the grim reality of Iran\u2019s deepening economic plight. A 40 percent drop in oil prices is forcing the government to start making cuts in popular subsidies and other government programs.On Tuesday, for example, the price of bread, one of the country\u2019s most important subsidized staples, was raised by 30 percent. On Wednesday, the Fars news agency reported that the government had quietly begun phasing out monthly cash handouts of roughly $11 per person to some groups of Iranians.Even the battered local currency, the rial, which the government props up, was allowed to fall by 8 percent recently, before recovering slightly.For the most part, Iranians are sloughing off the bad news. What if the nuclear negotiations fail and sanctions are continued, or even toughened further? \u201cIn that case I will be very depressed,\u201d Ms. Moghimi said. \u201cBut I really have the feeling that will not happen.\u201dThe continuing support for the nuclear talks from Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is a beacon of hope for many in Iran\u2019s private sector. \u201cThe leader of the revolution would not be backing a failing project,\u201d Mr. Hassannejad, the oil and gas consultant, said in his office. He said he had already made a round of hires in recent months in anticipation of a deal \u2014 and a subsequent wave of work. \u201cThe past years have been really difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quicker the talks end, the sooner we can start.\u201dOutside of the automotive conference hall, at the base of Tehran\u2019s 1,300-foot Milad Tower, Iranians gazed at the latest car models from Iran Khodro. An investor, Massoud Ranajee, said he too was optimistic. \u201cBut to be honest I have sold all my shares in this company,\u201d he said of Iran Khodro. \u201cIf they sign a deal with a foreign company, I might consider buying, but for now, it\u2019s all way too risky and uncertain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Needs Structural Reforms", "Date": "2014-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersRe \u201cBeing bad Europeans\u201d (Dec. 2): By putting most or even all of the blame for Europe\u2019s economic malaise on Germany, Paul Krugman expects too much from government stimulus policies and is too impatient with structural reforms.All of Europe, including Germany, needs to implement drastic structural reforms if the Continent is to again become an engine of growth and provider of jobs. Reducing the role of the state in the economy, making labor markets more flexible, facilitating participation of women in the labor force, encouraging meaningful immigration, fostering entrepreneurship, harmonizing taxation throughout Europe or lowering the regulatory burden for companies, to name just a few such reforms, are associated not only with lengthy legislative processes, but produce the desired results with significant delays.The current German government is enjoying the fruits of structural reforms (of its labor markets mainly) initiated by the previous government some 10 years ago. These reforms resulted in a stabilization of labor costs, which had grown much too fast during the 1990s and early 2000s. To complain now, as Mr. Krugman does, that Germany exports deflation misses the point: Other countries failed to reform their economies after Germany and France had broken the deficit criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact that were meant to enforce prudent fiscal behavior in the absence of a national currency and a fiscal and political union in Europe.Germany, as the biggest economy in Europe, undoubtedly should raise its level of consumer and investment spending, especially since the latter have fallen behind earlier levels and those of other advanced countries. In this context, Germany\u2019s current insistence on a balanced budget as a milestone achievement is misplaced \u2014 both at home and as a signal abroad. And the European Commission should stimulate Europe\u2019s economy with a much larger investment program than it has been contemplating so far.But Mr. Krugman seems to push aside two important risks: first, there is no guarantee that national or Europe-wide expansionary policies will produce sustainable medium- and long-term growth; and second, experience has shown that such policies could easily take off the pressure to implement the required painful structural reforms.Ulrich Hewer, WashingtonThe writer is an adjunct professor in the School of Business at the University of Maryland, College Park.Mr. Krugman\u2019s criticism of Germany for insisting on adherence to the criteria for public sector budgets freely agreed by the member states of the eurozone deserves to be nuanced. The eurozone\u2019s rules-based system for economic policy has its weaknesses \u2014 especially when there are considerable differences in economic structures and historic economic policy among the member states of the currency union. But the true alternative to such a rules-based policy cannot simply be to let member states independently attempt (probably with singular lack of success) to spend their way out of stagnation.German leaders have expressed the necessity for deepening economic and political integration as a condition for greater solidarity among the states of the eurozone, and their willingness to contemplate such deepened integration. French, Italian and Spanish support for such integration is also a necessary condition for the solidarity that would permit a more flexible approach to dealing with the problems of the eurozone.James Leavy, ParisAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Economic Boom Recedes, but South America Might Avert the Bust", "Date": "2014-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySouth America MemoFor a decade, the continent was transformed by sustained economic growth and historic reductions in poverty, driven by a boom in prices for the region\u2019s abundant commodities, including oil, natural gas, copper, gold, iron, soybeans and corn.But now that boom is over, prices for those products are falling, and questions hang over the region. Will the good times be followed by a bust, as has happened repeatedly over the decades? Will governments react as they have before by loading up on debt and ignoring the danger signs?Or will things be different this time?Yet there are signs, he said, that many countries in the region are better positioned now than in the past to tackle the challenge.The key measure across the region, Mr. Ocampo said, is that the ratio of external debt to foreign reserves is at a historic low, which could give countries more room to maneuver during hard times.\u201cLatin America has less debt and more reserves, less liabilities and more assets,\u201d he said. That gives countries a greater ability to borrow money to bridge shortfalls or pay for government stimulus measures.Many countries also have built stronger institutions, such as central banks and banking regulators, while finance ministers are often better prepared and, it is hoped, able to benefit from an understanding of past mistakes.\u201cWe are already in a period of slower economic growth, and the question is, \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Jorge Familiar, the World Bank\u2019s vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cTen or 15 years ago we would be talking about crisis management, and right now we\u2019re talking about growth strategies.\u201dBrazil, the continent\u2019s economic giant and the seventh-largest economy in the world, according to the World Bank, encapsulates both the problems and the promise of the region.After years of steady growth and poverty reduction, Brazil\u2019s economy has stagnated. While there are many problems, including corruption and government missteps, the situation has been aggravated by falling prices for some of its main exports, including iron ore and soybeans.President Dilma Rousseff, a leftist who was re-elected to a second term in October, has signaled that she will make economic growth a priority in her new term, choosing an economic team widely seen as being pro-business.They have a chance of succeeding, Mr. Ocampo said, because Brazil has developed a large manufacturing sector that could be the beneficiary of the region\u2019s new economic reality. When commodity prices are high, the currencies of exporting countries tend to rise in value. That can hurt other sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, since a stronger currency means that exported manufactured goods become more expensive to foreign buyers.That cycle is now in reverse, with currencies in Brazil and several other Latin American countries depreciating. While that can increase inflation, as has happened already in Brazil, in the long run it could lead to growth in manufacturing exports.The challenges are as great for Peru, which depends heavily on the mining operations that powered growth of more than 6 percent annually from 2002 to 2012. With metals prices now in retreat, the central bank predicts the economy will grow by just 3 percent this year.In response, the government of President Ollanta Humala has pushed stimulus measures that include increased government spending and tax cuts. Mr. Humala has also sought to clear the way for more mining, oil and gas projects, hoping to compensate for falling prices by increasing a metals production that remains profitable, if less so.But many of those projects have been stalled by environmental concerns and stiff opposition in local communities. Part of the government\u2019s new strategy is to streamline or scale back environmental regulations, including efforts to speed up the process of evaluating environmental impact statements, setting penalties for officials who do not meet deadlines and rolling back recent increases in fines for many environmental violations.\u201cIt just got cheaper to pollute,\u201d said Ricardo Giesecke, a former environment minister who is critical of the changes.Alonso Segura, the Peruvian finance minister, said the measures should help the country resume economic growth similar to that of recent years.\u201cWe want to sustain it at or close to 6 percent over the medium term,\u201d he said. New mining projects will enter into production next year while others are expected to increase production, he said. Infrastructure projects expected to get underway, like a Lima mass transit train line and a gas pipeline in southern Peru, will also generate jobs and economic activity.But Francisco Rodr\u00edguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York, said that optimistic predictions of new mines and other projects had fallen short in the past, often because of local opposition. He also pointed to the country\u2019s inability so far to tame its appetite for imported goods, a hangover from the years of high commodity prices.\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to have accepted that 6 percent growth is not a reasonable objective for Peru, and that means they haven\u2019t accepted that the commodities boom is over,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s called denial.\u201dPerhaps no country is more troubled, or more closely tied to the ups and downs of commodity prices, than Venezuela, which last year received more than 95 percent of its export income from oil. But oil prices have tumbled since the summer, with the price of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude dropping to less than $60 in December from more than $100 a barrel in July. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said recently that the collapse had cut his country\u2019s hard currency income by about a third, but the impact is expected to become even more acute next year.The Venezuelan economy was in bad shape before the oil price drop, with inflation of more than 60 percent, by far the highest rate in the region, and chronic shortages of consumer goods \u2014 a state of affairs for which, rightly or wrongly, most Venezuelans blame Mr. Maduro.Most economists believe the economy is now in recession, although it is not possible to know for sure, since the government has stopped releasing such data. The economy is also burdened by price controls, a greatly overvalued currency (at the principal exchange rate) and a central bank that has been printing vast amounts of money to keep the government operating.At the same time, yields have soared on the country\u2019s bonds, a signal that investors are concerned about a possible default. Mr. Maduro has said that will not happen and many economists say that it is unlikely.Yet Mr. Maduro has only sharpened investors\u2019 fears by attributing the country\u2019s problems to enemies waging an \u201ceconomic war\u201d aimed at toppling his socialist-inspired government. It is not clear whether they were soothed when Mr. Maduro said in a speech this month that in 2015 he would put aside most of his other duties to focus exclusively on the economy.Andrea Zarate contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uncertainty in Washington Poses Long List of Economic Perils ", "Date": "2014-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As House Republicans mull another round of fiscal brinkmanship with President Obama, a dark cloud is threatening to return to otherwise clearing economic skies: fiscal and political uncertainty. Republican leaders moved Tuesday to finesse their way around another government shutdown next week, but the fiscal gantlet extends well beyond Dec. 11, when the current stopgap spending law that funds much of the federal government expires. Absent congressional action, a host of business and personal tax breaks expires on Jan. 1. The government\u2019s borrowing limit is reinstated on March 16, although the government might not actually hit the ceiling until August. On March 28, unless lawmakers act, physician reimbursements from Medicare drop off a cliff. On May 31, the highway trust fund runs out of money. In June, the Export-Import Bank, which helps finance overseas purchases of American exports, might shut in the face of conservative opposition to its mission. Then on Sept. 30, the entire Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program faces its expiration. A few days later, across-the-board spending cuts loom once again.\u201cI see a lot of potential for Republicans to use all these fiscal speed bumps as leverage points,\u201d said Joel Prakken, a co-founder of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm that calculated that previous fiscal fights, combined with tighter budgets, shaved as much as 1 percentage point off economic growth, a big sum considering that growth has averaged an annual rate of 2.15 percent since Republicans took control of the House in 2011.\u201cInvestors should prepare for a return of this type of behavior and volatility in Washington in 2015 as governing-by-crisis appears ready to return,\u201d Chris Krueger, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, warned clients on Tuesday. \u201cFrom a businessman\u2019s standpoint, uncertainty in general just has a huge impact in how you think of the future, how you plan for capital investment and how you plan for hiring,\u201d said Randall L. Stephenson, chairman of AT&T and of the Business Roundtable. \u201cJust go down the long list. There\u2019s a wide range of possible outcomes on policy, so you have to come to a more conservative approach to planning.\u201dCongressional leaders moved to clear up some uncertainty Tuesday, but in so doing, they may merely create more. House Republican leaders would like to pass a measure funding the government through Sept. 30, but keeping the Homeland Security office open only for short bursts to pressure the president over his executive action deferring deportation of illegal immigrants.Most House Republicans appeared ready to go along with this half measure, but conservative groups opposed the strategy as not confrontational enough on issues like the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s climate change regulations or the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s antidiscrimination efforts. Anti-immigration conservatives made it clear they would keep opposing the undocumented-worker executive order.\u201cThis is the time to fight, this is the ground to fight on, and I\u2019m a little bit amazed that that isn\u2019t more clear to more people,\u201d declared Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa.Negotiators have all but given up culling the government\u2019s growing list of temporary tax measures, making some permanent and jettisoning the most egregious tax giveaways. Instead, the House will vote Wednesday on a measure to restore almost all the tax breaks that expired last year for one year retroactively. That would allow taxpayers to claim them on their 2014 tax returns while forcing Congress to grapple with the issue again early next year.\u201cShort of not passing anything at all, this is probably the worst of all possible worlds,\u201d said Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah and the incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cRather than the certainty that would come with making some of the more prominent individual and business tax extenders permanent, families, individuals, and businesses will have to once again put long-term plans on hold in hopes that Congress can get its act together next time around.\u201dMeantime, 45 House Republicans pleaded with their leaders to bring to a vote a multiyear extension of federal terrorism risk insurance, which is set to expire this month. The issue is vital to developers in Lower Manhattan and elsewhere, who cannot get large building projects insured in the private sector without a government backstop.Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and an opponent of the seven-year terrorism insurance bill passed 93-4 by the Senate, said no, blaming Senate Democrats for not agreeing with his position. \u201cIf Senate Democrats continue to insist on their \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach, I fear a long-term reauthorization may have to wait until the next Congress,\u201d he said.Some economists say the overall impact may be overblown. As Washington nears another showdown, stock prices tend to sag and some bonds get dumped in a fire sale, said Alec Phillips, managing director for United States economic research at Goldman Sachs. Then they snap back postcrisis.Leaders in neither party wanted to defend the contortions to come. \u201cThe American people certainly do not want to face another year being governed by crisis,\u201d warned Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader until next month. \u201cNo one wants the kind of cliffhanger fights we\u2019ve had again and again in years past.\u201dAshley Parker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Compromises, a Global Accord to Fight Climate Change Is in Sight", "Date": "2014-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe draft, now circulating among negotiators at a global climate summit meeting here, represents a fundamental breakthrough in the impasse that has plagued the United Nations for two decades as it has tried to forge a new treaty to counter global warming.But the key to the political success of the draft \u2014 and its main shortcoming, negotiators concede \u2014 is that it does not bind nations to a single, global benchmark for emissions reductions.Instead, the draft puts forward lower, more achievable, policy goals. Under the terms of the draft, every country will publicly commit to enacting its own plans to reduce emissions \u2014 with governments choosing their own targets, guided by their domestic politics, rather than by the amounts that scientists say are necessary.The idea is to reach a global deal to be signed by world leaders in Paris next year, incorporating 196 separate emissions pledges.\u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough, because it gives meaning to the idea that every country will make cuts,\u201d said Yvo de Boer, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change.\u201cBut the great hopes for the process are also gone,\u201d he added. \u201cMany people are resigned,\u201d he said, to the likelihood that even a historic new deal would not reduce greenhouse gas levels enough to keep the planet\u2019s atmospheric temperature from rising 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.That is the point at which, scientists say, it will become impossible to avoid the dangerous and costly early effects of climate change \u2014 such as melting glaciers, rising sea levels, extreme drought, food shortages and more violent storms.The Lima draft represents the input of all the negotiating countries, though there are still several major hurdles to work out. But even then, experts say, at best the new deal might be enough only to curb global warming by about half as much as scientists say is necessary.Until recently, the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest greenhouse gas polluters, have been at the center of the impasse over a climate deal.Until this year, the United States had never arrived at the United Nations\u2019 annual climate negotiations with a domestic policy to cut its own carbon emissions. Instead, it merely demanded that other nations cut their use of coal and gasoline, while promising that it would do so in the future.China, meanwhile, was the lead voice among nations demanding that developing economies should not be required to commit to any cuts.Negotiators here call the joint announcement between China and the United States the catalyst for the new draft, which, if approved at the climate summit meeting this week, would set the stage for a final deal to be signed by world leaders next year in Paris.The Lima draft does not include Kyoto-style, top-down mandates that countries cut emissions by specific levels. Instead, it includes provisions requiring that all nations, rich and poor, commit to policies to mitigate their emissions. Countries that sign on to the deal will commit to announcing, by March, detailed, hard-numbers plans laying out how they will cut emissions after 2020.The draft that emerges this week \u201cwill look like a game of Mad Libs,\u201d said one negotiator who was not authorized to speak publicly. Over the coming months, as countries put forth their emissions reduction pledges, the details of the final deal will be filled in.It is expected that many countries will miss that March deadline. Officials from India and other countries have said that they are unlikely to present a plan before June.In order to ensure that all countries are included in the deal, late announcers will get a pass. The point, United Nations officials say, is to ensure that the information exists to finalize a Paris deal by December 2015.Negotiators concede that the \u201ceach according to their abilities\u201d approach is less than perfect \u2014 but that it represents what is achievable.\u201cThe reality of it is that nobody was able to come up with a different way of going about it that would actually get countries to participate and be in the agreement,\u201d said Todd D. Stern, the lead American climate change negotiator. \u201cYou could write a paper, in theory, assigning a certain amount of emissions cuts to every country. That would get the reduction you need. But you wouldn\u2019t get an agreement. We live in the real world. It\u2019s not going to be perfect.\u201dAnd there are still many hurdles ahead.While many major developing economies are now expected to follow China\u2019s lead in preparing emissions plans, some countries remain wild cards. This year, the government of Australia repealed a landmark climate change law that taxed carbon pollution. Since then, its emissions have soared.\u201cAustralia is left without any viable policy to cut emissions,\u201d said Senator Christine Milne, the leader of the Australian opposition Green Party. \u201cIt\u2019s going to drag its heels.\u201dMoney, as always, is a sticking point.Another element to be hashed out by negotiators will be devising an international number-crunching system to monitor, verify and compare countries\u2019 pledged emissions cuts.China has always balked at any outside monitoring of its major economic sectors, and is pushing back on proposals for rigorous outside scrutiny.Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that his country \u201calways supports increasing transparency\u201d but that the new reporting system should reflect \u201cthe reality that developing countries\u2019 basic capacities in areas like national statistics and assessment are still insufficient.\u201d He added that \u201cdeveloped countries should provide appropriate support to developing countries.\u201dThe United States has urged that a final deal not take the form of a legally binding treaty requiring Senate ratification, hoping to avoid a repeat of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol experience.But many countries continue to press for a legally binding deal.French officials have already given the yet-to-be-signed deal a working title: the \u201cParis Alliance.\u201dThe name, they say, is meant to signify that many different economies are working together, rather than complying with a single, top-down mandate.Edward Wong contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teachers\u2019 Strikes Spread Across Northeast China", "Date": "2014-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Strikes by thousands of teachers frustrated by low salaries and mandatory payments to pension plans have spread across cities in northeast China, state news media reported on Monday.The strikes began last week and have spread to a half-dozen cities or counties near Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang Province, where economic growth has long been slower than elsewhere in China. Classes in some primary and high schools in Heilongjiang have been suspended, the reports said.Teachers are asking for raises and for the government to end required payments to a pension plan. China National Radio reported that one teacher was making less than $400 a month after working for 25 years.In China, teaching has long been a profession with relatively low pay. Teachers from Yilan had posted a letter online that said educators who have worked for 20 years make just over $320 per month, and new teachers make $160 \u2014 \u201ceven more pathetic,\u201d according to the letter.The teachers acknowledged in their letter that the strike had caused hardships for students. \u201cIt hurts us that kids are affected because of this,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re profoundly sorry. Whatever we owe the kids, we\u2019ll make up for in the future by being available all the time.\u201dThere have been more reports in recent years of strikes in China by people in low-paid occupations. The labor pool of younger workers is getting smaller, and the growth rate of the Chinese economy has been slowing. Salary increases for lower- and middle-class workers have lagged behind inflation in many regions.The grievances over the teachers\u2019 pension plan have arisen because of a project started in 2004 by Heilongjiang Province, and supported by the central government, that requires government workers, including teachers, to contribute part of their salaries to a centralized provincial pension payment plan for all citizens. Previously, government workers were exempt from making payments.Another letter posted online by teachers in the city of Shuangcheng, west of Harbin, said they should not be forced to contribute to the pension plan unless the policy is enacted nationally. Officials in Shuangcheng would not discuss the strike and several schools in the city said they were operating normally.The protests around Heilongjiang began after teachers in the city of Zhaodong, in the same province, took to the streets in mid-November to demand higher salaries. The local government approved an average increase of $125 a month and promised to investigate working conditions, state news media reported. The teachers in Zhaodong then went back to work.Strikes by teachers have taken place recently in other parts of China. Teachers at one junior high school in Guangdong Province protested in late October when the government began paying them about $260 a month after having promised a monthly salary of $800, according to the People\u2019s Daily, the main Communist Party newspaper. A similar walkout occurred in March at a kindergarten in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong.In early September, teachers at a high school in the city of Xiaogan, in Hubei Province, went on strike over what they called the government\u2019s refusal to give them the proper status in the public employment system. The status helps determine details of their pension plans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ebola Should Be Easy to Treat", "Date": "2014-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispatchFREETOWN, Sierra Leone \u2014 NOT even 30 minutes away from the little house where I watched a girl die from Ebola sat the clinic she had been so desperate to reach. It was a modest compound, of simple rooms lined with iron cots. I didn\u2019t see any blinking computer screens or machines that beeped. It looked more like a high school nurse\u2019s office than an I.C.U.In one room, nurses were quietly putting pills on little squares of paper.\u201cWhat are those?\u201d I asked.\u201cThat\u2019s medicine for Ebola patients,\u201d explained a Sierra Leonean doctor.I checked the boxes: acetaminophen, ciprofloxacin, some oral rehydration salts \u2014 all available at the smallest pharmacies, even here. I was stunned.\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d I asked.\u201cYeah,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Maybe an IV for the really bad cases.\u201dI\u2019ve covered a lot of disasters in Africa \u2014 famines, civil wars, warlords on the rampage, all the nasty things that many people associate with the poorest continent on earth. We\u2019re used to seeing shots of Africans dead on a red dirt road with a white United Nations helicopter chugging above.Maybe Ebola looks like that from a distance. But up close it\u2019s different. What I learned this past month reporting in Sierra Leone is that this is one crisis that should be relatively easy to solve.Ebola, however much some of its symptoms conjure up a horror film, is usually shockingly simple to treat. The virus is swift and ruthless, hideous and creepy, causing some patients to have bloody vomit, bloody diarrhea or even \u2014 in severe cases \u2014 bloody eyeballs. Ebola is one of the handful of viruses than can trigger a hemorrhagic fever, with internal bleeding, but in most cases the biggest threat is dehydration, which can be addressed by clean water and basic drugs.As Daniel Bausch, an infectious disease doctor at Tulane University, has said, \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science\u201d \u2014 Ebola is as much about logistics as medicine. The key to defeating it is enough ambulances, enough hospital beds and a competent way to identify sick people, get them into care quickly before they infect others and then replenish the fluids they lose because of the virus.This stands in stark contrast to the Somali famine, the endless wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo or South Sudan\u2019s recent implosion \u2014 all extremely complex crises fueled by decades of reckless policies, regional intrigue and serious money to be made from chaos.The fact that Ebola can be battled back so easily is what makes it so frustrating and depressing \u2014 and even at times maddening. I learned that my first day. I was driving through a village, looking for Ebola victims to profile (as journalists do in these circumstances), when some community volunteers waved me over to a small house with a rusted roof.A family was assembled on the porch, and Isatu Sesay, a 16-year-old girl in a V-neck sweater, was sitting in a chair, looking woozy.\u201cShe\u2019s been vomiting all day,\u201d her mother said. \u201cShe has diarrhea. She has fever. We keep waiting for an ambulance, but the ambulance don\u2019t come.\u201dI glanced at my colleagues, who had been covering Ebola for months.\u201cWhat about giving her a ride?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo way,\u201d they answered.It would be extremely dangerous; she was clearly infectious and we might easily contract the disease.Jaime, the translator, pulled me aside.\u201cDon\u2019t get too emotional,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe slightest mistake you do could be the biggest mistake you\u2019ll ever make.\u201dIt was quiet on the ride back to our hotel. In the streets of Freetown, Sierra Leone\u2019s capital, people hauled tubs of soda, sacks of cement, bananas, melons, trousers, plastic pipes \u2014 an entire economy carried on the tops of heads.It may be hard, thousands of miles away, to appreciate just how broken these places are. But Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone \u2014 the West African Ebola triumvirate \u2014 with 18,000 cases among them, are among the world\u2019s least developed nations, definitely a factor in this Ebola crisis, though I am suspicious of making it too big of one. Other West African countries, like Mali, also very poor, and Nigeria, now being called \u201cAfrica\u2019s Afghanistan\u201d because of the intensity of its Islamist insurgency, wrapped up their Ebola outbreaks in a matter of weeks, with few deaths, showing it can be done.The next day, when I drove back to the village, Isatu had descended to a different state. She was flat on her back, delirious, stains of dried black vomit on her jeans. The virus was gnawing through her. Her eyes were bolted open, as if something huge and monstrous were coming right at her.Neighbors kept calling the Ebola hotline. No response. I couldn\u2019t believe it, so I called myself.\u201cGood morning, Ebola response center,\u201d said a cheery voice.I provided Isatu\u2019s name, address, age and symptoms.\u201cThis is very urgent,\u201d I added. \u201cDo you have many cases like this?\u201d\u201cO.K., sir, O.K.,\u201d the operator replied.Click.Isatu was dead by sundown.She was buried in a plastic sack in a shallow grave in a crowded graveyard.As I watched, my guilt made me nauseated. It wasn\u2019t simply that I hadn\u2019t given her a ride. Had I been thinking straight, I could have at least run out to a local drugstore and bought some medicine to boost her survival chances until an ambulance arrived. It would have been so easy.In so many stories I\u2019ve covered about people in need, I struggle with when to step back, when to help out, how to be a so-called impartial observer, as I\u2019m paid to be, but at the same time remain a decent human being. Here I failed.The ambulance never came, I later found out, because some health workers went on strike that week for lack of pay. But even that didn\u2019t make sense. The United States and other countries have injected hundreds of millions of dollars into the Ebola fight; every day, it seemed, another planeload of international experts arrived \u2014 Chinese epidemiologists, Cuban nurses, American microbiologists, British engineers. I kept hearing from aid workers that maybe this was the problem: Sierra Leone now had too many experts, too many sources of differing advice.\u201cIt\u2019s madness,\u201d said Peter Simpson, a British paramedic operations manager who was recently in Sierra Leone. \u201cYou have 44 NGOs here and they\u2019re all working in their silos.\u201dMr. Simpson seemed to have an uncommon amount of common sense. When I spoke to him last, in mid-December, he was cooking up a plan to turn Freetown\u2019s soccer stadium into a giant Ebola clinic because six months into its epidemic, Sierra Leone still doesn\u2019t have enough hospital beds.\u201cWHY aren\u2019t they using the biggest building in Sierra Leone?\u201d he vented. \u201cIt\u2019s got running water, flood lights, you could have 500 beds there in less than a month.\u201d Until then, he said, \u201cyou give people anti-malarials, O.R.S.,\u201d or oral rehydration salts, \u201cbananas for fluid, the basics.\u201dI thought back to Isatu \u2014 all the frustrations, helplessness and anger I\u2019d felt in Sierra Leone had been present in her, my first case. More than 6,000 people have died, but she was the one I won\u2019t be able to forget. I unloaded my guilt on an editor in New York who offered a wise solution: Buy a bag of medicine and keep it in the car, just in case, which we did.But we never found another Isatu. We found very sick people and people who had been successfully treated but no one in that feverish limbo Isatu had been in when she was calling for help.The night I left, I grabbed my suitcase out of the back of our car. The bag of medicine was still there, untouched.The East Africa bureau chief for The New York Times, who is currently writing a memoir. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cameron Pulls Back From the Brink", "Date": "2014-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyDavid Cameron has pulled back from the brink. A month ago, the prime minister of the United Kingdom was close to advocating quotas on migrants from the European Union. Such a policy would have been undeliverable, as it would have meant flouting one of the European Union\u2019s core principles \u2014 the free movement of people.If Mr. Cameron had made such a pledge and failed to deliver on it, he would then have had to campaign to pull Britain out of the Union in a referendum he wants to hold by the end of 2017. The people would probably have followed the prime minister\u2019s lead and the British economy would have been badly damaged, as business would have lost full access to the bloc\u2019s single market.All this, of course, would have been contingent on Mr. Cameron\u2019s winning the general election in May because, without that, he would not be in a position to hold his promised in/out vote.In the end, the prime minister blinked. Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, and other leaders pleaded with him not to call for quotas. So did some top British businesses.When Mr. Cameron actually made his speech on Friday, the focus was on withholding migrants\u2019 access to benefits, not on quotas. That policy looks deliverable.The prime minister made a good speech. He stressed the advantages that Britain got from immigration: \u201cWe are Great Britain because of immigration, not in spite of it.\u201dHe spoke of earlier generations of Jews, West Indians and Asians who had come to Britain to work \u2014 as well as Polish and Czech pilots who fought with the British in World War II. He acknowledged that the current generation of immigrants, both from inside the European Union and from further afield, have played a vital role in institutions as varied as the National Health Service and the City of London.But Mr. Cameron is under pressure \u2014 both from euroskeptics in his own Conservative Party and as a result of the growing strength of the U.K. Independence Party, which wants Britain to leave the Union \u2014 to take a harder line on immigration.This is mainly because he promised to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands but has failed to deliver. Through June of this year, the figure was 260,000, up 43 percent from the previous year.The centerpiece of Mr. Cameron\u2019s new policy is to deny European Union migrants \u201cin-work\u201d benefits unless they have been living in Britain for four years. He believes these benefits \u2014 mainly to top up low pay, help with rearing children and subsidize rent \u2014 are attracting unskilled workers from the rest of the Union to Britain, which is generating lots of new jobs. For somebody making minimum wage with two children, they amount to 700 pounds, or about $1,095, a month.Removing this subsidy to low-paid workers \u2014 along with other measures like scrapping the ability of migrants to get unemployment benefits as soon as they arrive in the country \u2014 would have some effect on the numbers coming to Britain. But it is not clear that it would have a big effect. After all, these in-work benefits were not available in 2004 for migrants from Eastern Europe, and they still came in large numbers.That said, Mr. Cameron has set out his policy and it is too late for him to toughen it up by switching back to quotas before the election. The central question, therefore, is whether he can deliver the program via negotiations with his European Union colleagues. This is not something he can impose unilaterally because denying benefits to European Union citizens that are available to natives is discriminatory and contrary to the bloc\u2019s laws.Mr. Cameron seems to think he needs to change European Union treaties to get the necessary green light. The snag is that this is a laborious process that would require the unanimous agreement of all 27 other countries. It would, therefore, be better to proceed by merely changing European Union law. Some experts, like Damian Chalmers, a professor of European Union law at the London School of Economics, think that would be sufficient. It would also require only a so-called qualified majority of member states \u2014 essentially approval by countries whose populations account for 65 percent of the Union\u2019s total.Britain stands a good chance of jumping that hurdle, not least because many other member states \u2014 including Germany, Italy and Spain \u2014 face pressure from their own people to stop migrants from getting benefits. Although some countries from Eastern Europe may not like the policy, they will find it hard to assemble a blocking minority. Mr. Cameron has also hinted that he may campaign to quit the Union if he does not get his way.It is a pity that the prime minister has invested so much political capital in this issue. There are so many other economically more important issues on the Union\u2019s agenda, like completing the single market in services, negotiating a free trade deal with America and creating a capital markets union. That said, Britain\u2019s partners and British business can breathe a sigh of relief that Mr. Cameron has not jumped past the brink.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Says It Will Be \u2018Patient\u2019 on Interest Rate Timing", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Wednesday that the Fed still expected to start raising interest rates next year, but that it would wait patiently for the right time and did not expect to begin any earlier than late April.Ms. Yellen\u2019s remarks, and a statement issued by the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, both emphasized that the nation\u2019s central bank was not inclined to act more quickly in light of positive economic news, including stronger job growth and plummeting oil prices.\u201cThe committee considers it unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at news conference after a two-day meeting of Fed policy makers. In response to a question, she said she meant two meetings, ruling out scheduled sessions in January and March.Stock markets, which have jittered up and down in recent days, rose sharply after the Fed released its statement at 2 p.m. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 2 percent to close at 2,012.89, its largest daily percentage gain of the year.\u201cThe Fed is in the fortunate position of enabling the economy to gather steam without the shadow of immediately rising rates,\u201d said Paul Atkinson, head of North American equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, a British firm with $525 billion in investments. \u201cIn our opinion, that has to be positive for equity investors.\u201dBond markets moved in the opposite direction as traders struggled to weigh the impact of the Fed news and events in Russia. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose to 2.14 percent from 2.08 percent late Tuesday.For almost a year now, Fed officials have pointed toward the summer of 2015 as the most likely time for the long-awaited lift of short-term interest rates, which the Fed has held near zero since December 2008.Fifteen of the 17 Fed officials who participate in meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee said the first rate increase would come in 2015, according to an aggregation of their economic outlooks also published on Wednesday.The job market has not healed completely, but Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials say the economy is now strong enough to allow them to start raising rates toward more normal levels next year. Employers added, on balance, a monthly average of 224,000 jobs over the 12 months ending in November, including 321,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8 percent from 7 percent.Officials predicted the unemployment rate would fall into a range they regard as healthy for the economy in 2015, ending the year between 5.2 and 5.3 percent.Fed officials have also expressed relatively little concern about the collapse of oil prices, the crumbling of the Russian economy or turbulence in global markets. Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that lower oil prices were \u201ccertainly good\u201d for American consumers, who have more money to spend. As for Russia, she said the exposure of the American economy and financial system was \u201cactually relatively small.\u201d But the sluggish pace of inflation has replaced unemployment as the main reason that the Fed may keep rates near zero for at least a little longer.Fed policy has failed to lift inflation back toward the 2 percent annual pace the central bank has fixed as its target. The Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation increased by just 1.4 percent during the 12 months ending in October, and the annualized pace has not touched 2 percent in more than two years.In new forecasts published on Wednesday, Fed officials sharply downgraded their 2015 inflation expectations, predicting that prices would rise a mere 1 to 1.6 percent. In September they predicted inflation in 2015 of 1.6 to 1.9 percent.Officials also continued to predict a quick rebound. The forecast for 2016 remained unchanged, with a predicted pace of 1.7 to 2 percent.That forecast is based on an assumption shared by most Fed officials about the way inflation works. They believe expectations about future inflation, and labor market slack, both exert a powerful influence over the actual pace of inflation. Surveys show little change in expectations and so, as the labor market continues to tighten, Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials expect that inflation will increase.But Ms. Yellen added that the Fed would act only once it was \u201creasonably confident\u201d that this story was indeed playing out. \u201cHistorically we have seen as the economy strengthens and slack diminishes that inflation does tend to gradually rise over time,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be looking for evidence that I think strengthens my confidence in that view.\u201dBut Fed officials also concede that the workings of inflation remain somewhat mysterious. Inflation, for example, did not slow as much as many officials expected when unemployment was high during the recession. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a recent interview that he also did not take much comfort from the steadiness of inflation expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s either rock solid and the public understands it or they really don\u2019t move for any reason,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the fact that the market measures have moved down makes me nervous, perhaps more nervous than some others.\u201dThe Fed removed from the latest policy statement the phrase that it would wait a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d before starting to raise rates, widely interpreted as meaning at least six months. But at the same time, it said the Fed did not intend to signal a change in intentions.\u201cThe committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy,\u201d said the statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee. \u201cThe committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement.\u201dMs. Yellen began her news conference, shortly after the release of the statement, by emphasizing that the Fed\u2019s new statement \u201cdoes not represent a change in our policy intentions.\u201dShe said the change in language was made because the \u201cconsiderable time\u201d language was tied to the conclusion of the Fed\u2019s bond purchase program.The change, however, was backed by just seven of the 10 voting members of the policy committee, reflecting an unusual degree of fragmentation for an institution that prizes consensus.There were dueling dissents in favor of more and less patience.Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, dissented because he said the Fed should do more to raise inflation, which he sees as a way to encourage more growth in jobs and output.Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, both dissented because they said the Fed was not retreating from its stimulus position fast enough.None of the men, however, will serve among the voting members of the committee next year. They will be replaced by presidents of other reserve banks. And they all have announced their intention to retire from the Fed over the next year or so.A capsule summary on Thursday for an article about the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy statement misstated its expected actions next year. As the article in Business Day correctly noted, the Fed will raise interest rates, not cut them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Greece\u2019s New Crisis Isn\u2019t Spreading to the Rest of Europe", "Date": "2014-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA View From AbroadNow, Grexit may be back. But, remarkably, the sense of panic isn\u2019t.Anyone who spent the years 2010-12 either making economic policy or reporting on the eurozone crisis will surely have nasty flashbacks. But missing now are the jaw-dropping swings in markets that punctuated that time when the entire global financial system seemed to be in grave peril from doings in Athens and Brussels.The Greek markets are being hammered, of course. A decision to renege on agreements with international creditors, or even to leave the euro, would have serious consequences for Greece\u2019s economy and its place in the world. The Athens Stock Exchange index is down 21 percent since Dec. 8, and investors sold off Greek bonds so furiously on Monday that its 10-year borrowing costs spiked 1.2 percentage points to 9.39 percent. (Germany\u2019s 10-year bonds, by contrast, are yielding a mere 0.54 percent).But what we\u2019re not seeing is the kind of contagion that was widespread from 2010 to 2012. At that time, any sign that the crisis was worsening in Greece immediately translated, through the financial markets, into greater panic about the much larger European economies of Spain and Italy.Investors\u2019 logic was simple: They figured that if Greece defaulted on its bonds, dropped out of the euro currency area or otherwise turned into even more of a financial basket case, the same could happen in other countries with shaky finances.In effect, every day became a binary choice: Either all-out collapse became more likely (in which case investors would sell Spanish and Italian bonds along with stocks and other risky assets) or less likely (in which case they would sell United States Treasury bonds, German government bonds and other safe assets and move back into the risky stuff).But Greece\u2019s latest troubles don\u2019t seem to be adding much to economic and financial uncertainty beyond Greece. Spanish and Italian bond prices fell a bit Monday and their yields rose a bit, but Spain\u2019s 10-year borrowing costs are now at 1.67 percent and Italy\u2019s at 1.98 percent, much closer to Germany than to Greece.The European stock market over all was down a mere 0.24 percent Monday, and the Vix, a measure of expected future stock market volatility, ticked up only slightly.In other words, financial markets view Greece\u2019s problems \u2014 and Greece\u2019s future \u2014 as important for Greece alone. Since 2012, the European Central Bank has pledged to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to prevent a crisis of confidence in European bonds (read: buy them as the lender of last resort if private markets dry up), and European governments have moved toward jointly guaranteeing the Continent\u2019s banks.All that has been enough to assure investors that whatever happens with the Greek elections, a renegotiation of a bailout package and even the resurgence of \u201cGrexit\u201d in the newspapers, a firewall has been built that will keep the rest of Europe safe from the damage.The great risk, of course, is that markets are wrong. The same political forces that appear poised to bring an extreme leftist party to power in Greece are bubbling in other parts of Europe.The European Central Bank\u2019s program to backstop European governments has never been tested in practice, and mainstream parties in Spain, France and Italy are facing challenges to their authority as the economy grinds along on the cusp of recession year after year. Germany\u2019s antipathy toward some of the reforms that might help correct the imbalances at the root of the weak economy, like much easier monetary policy or fiscal transfers from stronger economies to weaker ones, is as strong as ever.\u201cThe entire eurozone is in a race against time to achieve the necessary economic adjustments and deliver stronger growth and jobs before the politics breaks,\u201d writes Krishna Guha, who heads global policy research at Evercore ISI, in a research note.The risk is no longer that Greece\u2019s problems will infect the rest of Europe. It is that the same dynamics of political economy causing unrest in Greece will soon enough arise in its bigger neighbors.Advertisement"}

But with 90 percent of the country\u2019s surface water contaminated, and fearing damage to the Lempa River \u2014 an essential source of water for El Salvador\u2019s 6 million people \u2014 the administration failed to approve the proposal. In 2008, Mr. Saca instituted a moratorium on new mining permits; to date, this has been maintained and is widely popular.Pacific Rim fought back in 2009, filing a $77 million lawsuit with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (Icsid), a World Bank-affiliated institution in Washington that facilitates arbitration between governments and investors. The case was brought under a 1999 Salvadoran investment law, according to which foreign companies could take the Salvadoran government to international arbitral tribunals.Pacific Rim raised its suit to $301 million and the final Icsid hearing opened in September; a verdict is expected in 2015.International arbitration is considered by its proponents to be relatively objective.

But corporations are increasingly using investment and trade agreements \u2014 specifically, the investor-state dispute settlement provisions in them \u2014 to bring opportunistic cases in arbitral courts, circumventing decisions states deem in their best interest. And now investor-state dispute settlement provisions may be enshrined in two new treaties: the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and Trans-Pacific Partnership, currently under negotiation between, respectively, the United States and the European Union, and the United States and 11 Asia-Pacific nations. If the final agreements contain these mechanisms, we can expect a flood of cases like Pacific Rim v. El Salvador.Investor-state dispute settlement provisions feature in many significant pacts, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, and nine U.S.-E.U. bilateral investment treaties. Foreign investors can sue over alleged violations of myriad \u201cinvestor protections,\u201d including public-interest regulations that would reduce their profits. But it doesn\u2019t cut both ways: Governments or communities affected by foreign investors cannot bring claims. Equally troublesome, tribunal operations are often opaque.Today, countries from Indonesia to Peru are facing investor-state suits. Mexico and Canada have lost or settled five each under Nafta, paying hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign companies. In the largest award to date, Icsid in 2012 ordered Ecuador to pay $1.77 billion to Occidental Petroleum for canceling its contract with the corporation. And this October, it ordered Venezuela to pay $1.6 billion to Exxon to compensate for nationalizing oil projects. Nearly 200 disputes are pending at Icsid alone.American and European claimants have brought 75 percent of recent investor-state cases, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Unsurprisingly, Washington seeks to include investor-state-dispute provisions in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.But opposition is growing. The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, refuses to accept that European courts \u201cbe limited by special regimes for investor-to-state disputes.\u201d Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s vice chancellor and economy minister, has warned of states seeing \u201cpolicy objectives circumvented by the threat of damages.\u201d Last month, the French trade minister, Matthias Fekl, too, came out strongly against investor-state settlement provisions: \u201cWe must preserve states\u2019 rights\u201d to \u201cset and apply their own standards,\u201d he told the French Senate. British politicians have made similar statements amid fears that such cases could solidify the increasing privatization of Britain\u2019s national health service.Such thinking is not unfounded, particularly concerning environmental policy. In 2012, the Swedish energy company Vattenfall sued at Icsid following Germany\u2019s decision to phase out nuclear energy; though figures have not been made public, it allegedly claims billions from Berlin in compensation for shuttered power plants. And modification of a single set of regulations can trigger a flurry of litigation: In the Czech Republic, one change in energy policy yielded seven claims in 2013; in Spain, six.Investor-state dispute provisions need not be extended in new treaties. The European Union should continue to demand the removal of these provisions from the T.T.I.P. They must also be expunged from the T.P.P.For El Salvador, a $301 million loss \u2014 just under 2 percent of its G.D.P. \u2014 would significantly reduce funds available for health care and education. And even if Pacific Rim\u2019s claim fails, as many expect, the suit has cost El Salvador almost $13 million to date \u2014 which amounts to nearly its entire environment and natural resources spending in 2013. Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia have officially denounced the Icsid convention. Though El Salvador likely fears a retraction of Washington\u2019s substantial financial assistance if it withdraws, it should consider doing so as well.The investor-state dispute settlement mechanism is like playing soccer on half the field. Corporations are free to sue, and nations must defend themselves at enormous cost \u2014 and the best a government can hope for is a scoreless game. As the T.T.I.P. and T.P.P. negotiations continue, Pacific Rim vs. El Salvador should remind us not to privilege foreign investors to the detriment of the national \u2014 or global \u2014 good.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen\u2019s First Year at Fed: A Remarkably Steady Course", "Date": "2014-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt is my hope,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in that Chicago speech, delivered in late March, \u201cthat the courageous and determined working people I have told you about today, and millions more, will get the chance they deserve to build better lives.\u201dAs Ms. Yellen approaches her first anniversary atop the Fed, the course she is charting illustrates both her determination to make jobs more readily available \u2014 and the limits of that pursuit, which are to some extent self-imposed.Under her leadership, the central bank has effectively expanded its stimulus campaign. It has done so by standing still, leaving its plans unchanged even as unemployment has declined much more quickly than its officials had expected.At the same time, Ms. Yellen has made clear that low borrowing costs cannot address all of the problems preventing Americans from finding jobs, and that she is not willing to test whether higher inflation might lead to greater economic growth.In this conventional approach, Ms. Yellen has maintained a considerable degree of continuity with her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke.\u201cI think Ben and Janet would have worked it about the same way so far,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist who served as a special adviser to the Fed\u2019s board until September, when he returned to a position as a professor at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cTheir philosophies, their underlying view of macro, their view of the limits of policy \u2014 those views are, in what I observed, remarkably similar.\u201dBut both Fed officials and outside experts say that Ms. Yellen is likely to more distinctly define her own approach next year as the Fed picks its moment to start raising its benchmark interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.Since Ms. Yellen took over, the Fed has gradually ended its bond-buying campaign while pointing steadily to mid-2015 as the most likely timing for a first rate increase. The steady pace of the retreat owed much to an economic recovery that finally met the Fed\u2019s expectations after several rounds of disappointed hopes.\u201cWe\u2019re continuing with the path that they both laid out as Ben was leaving,\u201d said Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.Still, Alan S. Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University and a former Fed vice chairman, said maintaining that sense of stability was harder than it looked.He pointed out that the Fed had managed to almost completely rework the content of its official statements about the likely timing of the lift-off from zero without shifting the expectations of investors, a feat akin to rebuilding a ship without benefit of a dry dock.When Ms. Yellen was sworn into office in early February, Fed policy was directly tied to the unemployment rate.The Fed had declared its intention to keep its benchmark rate near zero at least as long as unemployment was above 6.5 percent.By the time unemployment fell below that threshold two months later, the Fed had instead declared its intent to keep rates near zero for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after the end of its bond-buying campaign in October. This month, the Fed replaced that language with a promise of \u201cpatience.\u201dWith each change, Ms. Yellen insisted \u2014 and markets accepted \u2014 that the timing had not changed.\u201cA substantial part of the story of Yellen\u2019s first year is how she deftly navigated through changes in language in the forward guidance,\u201d Mr. Blinder said. \u201cI thought it would be a hard job \u2014 it was so embedded in expectations \u2014 but she just slid right by it. And things that go incredibly smoothly often don\u2019t get noticed.\u201dMs. Yellen has worked hard to govern by consensus, her colleagues say, layering phone calls and planning meetings before each formal meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, largely during a series of eight meetings spread over the year.Whereas the former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan generally spoke first, to frame the discussion, Ms. Yellen has adopted Mr. Bernanke\u2019s practice of speaking last and summarizing the discussion.Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a frequent internal critic, said that both leaders listened carefully to his views, but that Ms. Yellen had made a meaningful adjustment.\u201cShe summarizes by including the specific names of people who have made arguments and what the counterbalances are,\u201d Mr. Fisher said.Still the Fed\u2019s steadiness is drawing increasingly sharp criticism from advocates from both sides, those counseling either more or less patience.Some officials, including Mr. Fisher, along with some outside economists and congressional Republicans, argue that the Fed is inflating and destabilizing financial markets, and that faster job growth means the Fed should retreat more quickly.The former Fed chairman Paul A. Volcker questioned at a conference in November why the Fed would ever seek to increase the pace of inflation.Other officials, along with a wide array of outside economists, are disappointed that Ms. Yellen has not pushed harder to raise inflation as a means toward faster job creation and higher wages. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, last week sharply criticized as \u201cunacceptable\u201d the Fed\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to increase its efforts.Peter Ireland, a professor of economics at Boston College, says Ms. Yellen has gotten the policy just about right. \u201cI think she deserves credit for resisting pressures to overreact on both sides,\u201d he said.He noted that Ms. Yellen had correctly judged that a rough first quarter was an aberration caused by cold weather. More recently, he said he agreed with the Fed\u2019s judgment that inflation was likely to increase if the economy continued to grow.The largest and most obvious change of Ms. Yellen\u2019s tenure is her emphasis on spending time with workers and highlighting their problems.During her Chicago trip, Ms. Yellen also visited a job-training center.The next day, she gave a speech highlighting the dangers of rising income inequality. Last month, she invited a group of workers and community activists to meet with her and other officials in the Fed\u2019s ornate boardroom.\u201cShe is a central banker who believes that it\u2019s O.K. to talk about unemployment as much you talk about inflation,\u201d Mr. Faust, the former special adviser, said.Eric S. Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who arranged the October trip, said Ms. Yellen\u2019s interest underscored her sense of empathy, which he described as one of her great strengths. He added that talking with workers also offered valuable perspective.\u201cI think a lot of previous chairs probably wouldn\u2019t be that comfortable in that setting and she was,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was also processing those conversations in a meaningful way. As soon as someone said that they were working part time, she said, \u2018O.K., why?\u2019 \u201dOver the next year it should become clearer how that empathy shapes the course of policy.An article on Dec. 23 about Janet L. Yellen\u2019s first year as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve misstated the number of times since 1992 that three Fed officials have dissented at a policy-making meeting. It is three times, not two.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Auto Safety Nominee Wants Finer Data Tools ", "Date": "2014-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s choice to lead the nation\u2019s top auto safety agency told a Senate committee on Wednesday that the agency, long criticized for failing to spot defects in cars, now faces so many consumer complaints that it has trouble keeping up.\u201cWe\u2019re not even talking about connecting the dots, we\u2019re just talking about the overload of having that many,\u201d said Mark R. Rosekind, at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee. The number of annual complaints made to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has recently jumped to 75,000 from 45,000, or about 60 percent, he said, with only nine people to analyze them. And there are only 16 field investigators, he said.Dr. Rosekind\u2019s nomination comes at a time of uncertainty and turmoil at the agency, which has been without a permanent leader for nearly a year. The safety agency faces an internal review of its operations by the Transportation Department, its parent agency, as well as an investigation by that department\u2019s inspector general.At the same time, the auto industry has increasingly become engulfed in a safety crisis, spurred by revelations that General Motors failed for more than a decade to a disclose a dangerous defect in millions of older cars that it has now linked to 36 deaths. More than 50 million vehicles \u2014 a record number \u2014 have been recalled in the United States this year.Dr. Rosekind, a psychologist who is a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which analyzes accidents and makes recommendations, received a mostly friendly response from both Democrats and Republicans.But several lawmakers took the opportunity to urge Dr. Rosekind, if he is confirmed, to take a harder line with automakers and their suppliers.\u201cThese companies are way more afraid of a civil lawsuit than they are of N.H.T.S.A,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who presided over the hearing. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that you keep that at the top of your list in terms of priorities. If you are not feared and respected, then you cannot do a good job.\u201dShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t think N.H.T.S.A. is either feared or respected at this point.\u201d She pointed to the refusal of the Takata Corporation, an airbag manufacturer, to expand a recall that has been limited to certain geographic areas to the rest of the nation, despite the urgings of the safety agency.While there was no apparent opposition to Dr. Rosekind\u2019s nomination, it was not clear whether the Senate would act before the session ends. But the ranking Republican member of the committee, John Thune of South Dakota, reiterated his criticism of the White House for leaving the post vacant for so long.Dr. Rosekind\u2019s opening statement mostly discussed auto safety, which has been the subject of multiple congressional hearings.He told the committee that safety was \u201ca very personal priority for me since my earliest days,\u201d because his father, a San Francisco police officer, was killed in the line of duty by a driver who ran a red light.\u201cThrough this single and profound event in my own life, I share in the individual and personal stories of so many people who have been affected by preventable tragedy on our roadways,\u201d he said.Dr. Rosekind has been one of the five members of the National Transportation Safety Board since June 2010. Before that, he had his own consulting company, Alertness Solutions, for 12 years, and before that, he was the director of the fatigue countermeasures program at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center. A psychologist trained at Stanford and Yale, he completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship program in sleep and chronobiology at Brown University\u2019s Alpert Medical School.The N.T.S.B. is an independent agency, with no regulatory authority, and Dr. Rosekind had no administrative responsibilities. The agency that Dr. Rosekind has been nominated to head, which has an annual budget of about $800 million, sets various standards for cars and highways.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Income Gap Shrinks in Chile, for Better or Worse", "Date": "2014-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneSANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 To anybody visiting this prosperous Andean capital, it is hard to overlook the potholes along the path of Latin America\u2019s economic development.Chile is a stellar performer by almost any standard. Income per person has grown fourfold over the last quarter-century. Today, many Chileans, rightly, see their nation as within shouting range of the advanced industrial world.Yet for all its economic success, the shanties sprawling outside of town are a sharp reminder that Chile has still not shaken the curse that has plagued Latin America for centuries: an immense gap between the haves and the have-nots that is virtually unparalleled in the rest of the world.\u201cWhy is it that when we grow we cannot improve the distribution?\u201d asked Juan Carlos Feres, president of the Overcoming Poverty Foundation here. \u201cWe have not managed to break the growth model that produces dynamics of exclusion.\u201dBut while vast disparities continue to exist, Chile, like much of Latin America, is practically the only place in the world today where the income gap is actually shrinking rather than widening.\u201cLatin America is experiencing a pervasive decline of inequality when in many other regions it is rising,\u201d said Nora Lustig, an economics professor at Tulane University who has been closely following the trends. \u201cThe decline in the 2000s was bigger than the increase in the 1990s, so it\u2019s not insignificant.\u201dUsing the \u201cGini index,\u201d research by Professor Lustig, Luis F. L\u00f3pez-Calva of the World Bank and Eduardo Ortiz Ju\u00e1rez of the United Nations Development Program found that income inequality was lower in 2012 than it had been in 2000 in 16 of the 18 Latin American countries for which there was data to track the trend. The index ranges from 0 in an impossibly egalitarian utopia where everybody earned exactly the same, to 100 where every last penny was hogged by a single person.The decline is widespread. The income gap shrank in countries run by left-leaning populist governments, like Venezuela and Argentina, and countries run by market-friendly governments to their right, like Peru and Colombia. It shrank in countries that grew faster and countries that grew more slowly.While scholars can point to individual programs contributing to the narrowing gap in some countries \u2014 the sharp increase in Brazil\u2019s minimum wage, for instance, or the expansion of pensions in Argentina to cover nearly all women over the age of 65 \u2014 nobody quite understands what is driving the regionwide dynamic.\u201cIt\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d said Augusto de la Torre, chief economist for Latin America at the World Bank. \u201cThe question is generating a new wave of research in the region and in my office.\u201dEven before there are more definitive answers, Latin American leaders have started to pat themselves on the back about the accomplishment. Trouble is, the improvement might be a symptom not so much of policy success but of deeply rooted economic vulnerability.Government redistribution appears to have played some role in reducing the Latin American income gap. Government programs, like the cash transfers under the Oportunidades program in Mexico or the Bolsa Familia in Brazil, have increased the income of poor families.Still, Professor Lustig and her colleagues concluded that new government transfers and changes in pensions accounted for only 30 percent of inequality\u2019s decline. Most of the action appears to have happened in the job market \u2014 before taxes and government spending kicked in.Something, it appears, has flattened the distribution of wages. Whether this is good or bad news depends on what that factor is.It could be a result of Latin America\u2019s substantial increase in the supply of university-educated workers, shrinking their wage premium compared with their less educated peers.\u201cI do think that the return to a college education has declined,\u201d said Jaime Ruiz-Tagle of the University of Chile. \u201cIt has declined because college education has become massive.\u201dThe narrative isn\u2019t entirely convincing, though. Mr. de la Torre notes the educational wage premium widened in the 1990s before starting to shrink in the early 2000s. This doesn\u2019t fit the trend of educational attainment, which has been increasing steadily since 1990.Other potential explanations don\u2019t tell such an optimistic story. For one, perhaps Latin America\u2019s new college graduates are inferior in some way.Latin America\u2019s education boom has driven the proliferation of private colleges, some of which are of lower quality. The students may be of lower quality too \u2014 coming from families that received poorer elementary and high school education and are less prepared for college.Together, these dynamics would reduce the skill level of newly educated workers, shrinking the wage premium they could command over those without a college education.Mr. de la Torre fears, however, that this is not the entire story, either. The declining return to education, he worries, is not simply about the supply of educated workers. It also has to do with a decline in the demand for skill.From soybeans to copper, China\u2019s insatiable demand for Latin America\u2019s raw materials pushed up the value of currencies across the region even as its cheap manufactured exports undercut Latin American countries\u2019 rickety industrial base, reducing their demand for skilled workers.\u201cIn this case, the fall of inequality would be bad news over the long term,\u201d Mr. de la Torre told me. \u201cWe would be specializing in sectors that require less knowledge.\u201dWhat this augurs for Latin Americans\u2019 future growth is hard to tell. But with Chinese growth slowing, there are increasing signs that the overall prosperity of a region that has long relied on commodity exports is now threatened.A slowing China might also put an end to the shrinking income gap. The World Bank argues that the only viable long-term path for Latin American economies is to increase productivity growth, investing in more skill-intensive industries.That makes a lot of sense. But in doing so, it may have to join the rest of the developed world in confronting the challenge of achieving growth without widening the income gap even further.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fueled by Recession, U.S. Wealth Gap Is Widest in Decades, Study Finds", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe wealthy are getting wealthier. As for everyone else, no such luck.Last year, the median net worth of upper-income families reached $639,400, nearly seven times as much of those in the middle, and nearly 70 times the level of those at the bottom of the income ladder.There has been growing attention to the issue of income inequality, particularly the plight of those earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour or close to it.But while income and wealth are related (the more you make, the more you can save and invest), the wealth gap zeros in on a different aspect of financial well-being: how much money and other assets you have accumulated over time, including the value of your home and car plus any investments in stocks, bonds and the like.The wealth gap \u201cexposes varying degrees of vulnerability,\u201d said Valerie Wilson, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center research group in Washington, adding that it also was passed down through the generations.While those at the top have managed to recoup much of the wealth lost during the economic downturn, middle-income families have not made any gains.\u201cThe Great Recession destroyed a significant amount of middle-income and lower-income families\u2019 wealth, and the economic \u2018recovery\u2019 has yet to be felt for them,\u201d the report concluded.Pew, which used data from the Federal Reserve, defined middle income as $44,000 a year for a family of four, while a yearly income of $132,000 for the same-size family pushed a household into the upper ranks. About one in five families qualifies for that higher status, while 46 percent occupy the middle range.The median household net worth last year for those in the middle was $96,500, only slightly above the $94,300 mark it hit in 1983 (after being adjusted for inflation). A poor household actually had a higher median net worth 30 years ago ($11,400 in 1983) than it counted last year ($9,300). Compare those results with the top fifth of income earners. In 1983, when the Fed began collecting the data, that group had a median wealth of $318,000; in 2013 it owned more than twice that.The share of wealth controlled by the bottom 90 percent of Americans, they concluded, has steadily declined since the mid-1980s.The Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz is part of a growing group of economists who argue that wealth inequality hurts economic growth. The latest increases in wealth, Mr. Stiglitz said, are the result of existing assets ballooning in value \u2014 like a penthouse apartment with a river view \u2014 rather than productive investment.The evidence from the report, Pew said, \u201ccould help explain why, by other measures, the majority of Americans are not feeling the impact of the economic recovery, despite an improvement in the unemployment rate, stock market and housing prices.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renovating? Don\u2019t Forget the Expediter", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are eight million (or so) stories in the Naked City \u2014 and at least as many lines. Just ask expediters. They\u2019re the people who are paid to stand on line at the Department of Buildings to file the documents that help residential and commercial construction projects. The more determined expediters get on line several hours before the Manhattan Department of Buildings on lower Broadway opens for business.When Mark Brotter dies, the inscription on his tombstone will read simply: \u201cThank God \u2014 no more plumbing Schedule B.\u201dMr. Brotter, 55, is an expediter, an imprecise term that is used to describe the men and women whose workdays are spent queuing up at the Manhattan branch of the New York City Department of Buildings to file the documents and pull the permits that allow construction projects \u2014 your kitchen renovation and the high-rise next door \u2014 to go forward.Mr. Brotter\u2019s business card and stationery describe him as a \u201cBuildings Department liaison,\u201d but he\u2019ll go with \u201carchitectural consultant\u201d when strangers ask about his occupation and he doesn\u2019t have time to explain. Those who want to annoy him call him a messenger. Those who really want to annoy him call him a runner. \u201cI\u2019m basically a middleman,\u201d he said. For its part, the Buildings Department insists on the title \u201cfiling representative.\u201dExpediters are hired by contractors, architects, homeowners and managing agents. Some are solo practitioners like Mr. Brotter, although on a large project he may take on a helper \u2014 an expediter for the expediter.Others are employed by large firms that do nothing but expediting, or are on the staffs of architectural or engineering firms. In the early 1990s, expediters numbered 300 to 400; today there are more than 8,300. (Filing representatives must register with the Buildings Department and pay a $50 annual fee for the right to stand on lines at department offices.) Fortunately, there\u2019s plenty of work to go around. The number of jobs filed at the Department of Buildings in fiscal year 2013 rose by 4.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 72,288. In fiscal year 2014, 82,551 jobs were filed, a jump of 14.2 percent. \u201cThe residential remodeling market follows the real estate market, and as we all know, the residential real estate market in New York City has been on fire,\u201d said Marc Kerner, a general contractor and the owner of Infinity Construction. \u201cThe renovation purse strings have been loosened because people are feeling more confident about the economy.\u201dThe keys to expediter success include comfortable shoes, optimism, an awareness of just which long line is the right long line and a willingness to show up at the Buildings Department long before dawn to be first on this or that list to see this or that examiner \u2014 the agency staff member who can green-light a construction job or stop it cold. The impediments: ever-changing rules, delays in processing forms \u2014 though according to Department of Buildings data, wait times are growing shorter \u2014 and the fact that expediters are limited to three pieces of business each time they get up to a service window, whether that means three tasks for one project or one each for three discrete clients. Then it\u2019s back in line.\u201cNobody really wants to go down to the D.O.B.,\u201d said George Quinn, 51, an expediter for 30 years. \u201cA lot of people compare it to the D.M.V., but it\u2019s much more complicated and there\u2019s much more involved. The city has its ways. There are forms and they have to be filled out in a certain way. There are processes and procedures.\u201cYou have to have a certain type of personality and some thick skin,\u201d Mr. Quinn continued, \u201cand know that if you don\u2019t get it done today, you\u2019ll get it done tomorrow.\u201dArchitects and engineers can file their own plans, and some do. Contractors also can get their own permits if they choose. There is a special line for professionals. But through day-in, day-out exposure to the vagaries of the Buildings Department, expediters have a nuts-and-bolts grasp of the minutiae that may elude their bosses.\u201cThey save us a lot of time,\u201d Mr. Kerner said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re willing to go down to the Department of Buildings.\u201dMr. Brotter\u2019s life is a welter of forms: PW1 (plan/work application); TR1 (a technical report); TR8 (a technical report related to environmental issues); ACP5 (an asbestos report); PW3 (an affidavit that breaks down the cost of a job); and of course that infernal Schedule B.\u201cIt has to be very exact. There are only so many ways to get it right and lots of ways to get it wrong,\u201d said Mr. Brotter, whose jobs right now involve renovations on Central Park West and several apartment combinations, currently among the most popular projects.\u201cThen, when the package is together, I bring it to the Buildings Department,\u201d Mr. Brotter said.Perhaps a form was filled out incorrectly. Perhaps the architect\u2019s rendering didn\u2019t clarify an egress or show handicap access to a bathroom. So it\u2019s back to the buildings department to pick up the package, make the necessary adjustments and schedule another meeting with that same examiner \u201cto try to get him to remove the objections,\u201d said Mr. Brotter, who moved 35 years ago to New York from Scranton, Pa., to work in the music industry and became an expediter because it fit in with his performing schedule. \u201cAnd sometimes,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey\u2019re like, \u2018This isn\u2019t what I wanted,\u2019 so you have to go back.\u201dMeanwhile, the client wants to start construction today and it\u2019s not possible to meet with an examiner until next Friday. Or maybe next month. The time varies depending on the number of objections, what is involved in addressing them, and the availability of the very busy examiner.\u201cYou go back and forth and back and forth,\u201d said Scott Schnall, a professional engineer. \u201cThat could take one day or one million days. It\u2019s true. The whole system is much more screwed up than you could ever imagine.\u201d For years, there were no requirements to be an expediter, but in the early 1990s, the City Council mandated registration with the Buildings Department. Then, in May 2013, the department started requiring integrity training via an online tutorial. (Is it O.K. to buy lunch for a safety inspector? Or offer him Yankee tickets? Take him out for a beer?)This May the department began requiring classroom work on topics like \u201cThe New York City Building Code,\u201d \u201cThe New York City Energy Conservation Code\u201d and \u201cThe New York City Zoning Resolution.\u201d Those aiming to obtain Class 1 registration sit through a 16-hour training program. Only then are they deemed qualified to submit documents to and remove them from the Buildings Department. People with higher ambitions \u2014 prospective Class 2 Code and Zoning Representatives \u2014 have a 36-hour course load, which, once successfully completed, allows them to appear before plan examiners.\u00a0The expediter\u2019s fee varies depending on the outlay of time and the complexity of a job. The charge for securing a permit for a contractor ranges from $200 to $400; for filing a project, $1,500 to $3,500. Plans that must go before the Landmarks Commission are a more costly proposition, as are projects that involve the conversion of a commercial space to a residence.If you think you can economize by being your own expediter, you can\u2019t \u2014 unless, of course, you go take the required training.On a recent afternoon, a standing fan gently stirred the air in Room 30 Customer Service at the Manhattan office of the Department of Buildings on lower Broadway. (Each borough has an outpost.) A long table held bottles of water, satchels, briefcases and stacks of file folders. Their owners, clutching thickets of paper, slumped in chairs, muttered into cellphones or stood near signs reading \u201cPre-filing line starts here\u201d and \u201cData Entry and Records.\u201dJoel Ochoa, 23, an expediter whose mother is also in the business, had been at the Buildings Department for four hours on behalf of his employer, an engineering consultancy. \u201cYou have to learn to be patient,\u201d Mr. Ochoa said. \u201cThere are people who got here earlier than me.\u201dOne of them was Anwar Khan, who works for an architectural firm and who had arrived at 8 a.m. to deal with amendments to a plan. \u201cWe can be in line for two hours,\u201d said Mr. Khan, who was waiting for a colleague to deliver paperwork so he could queue up again. \u201cAlways a line.\u201d David Daub, an architect, was planning to get a permit for a contractor colleague, but in the face of complications, was considering handing the job off to an expediter he had used in the past and who, by chance, was right across the room.\u201cThere are times that I\u2019ll hire an expediter and let them do what they do, and I\u2019ll see how they do it and I can apply those skills and maybe I\u2019ll go down to the D.O.B. next time,\u201d Mr. Daub said. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching the mechanic work on your car and maybe you can make the repair next time.\u201d Plus, he added, \u201cI enjoy the scene at the Buildings Department.\u201dFew share his enthusiasm. \u201cMy expediters can get to the D.O.B. at 5:30 a.m. and leave at 2 p.m. with nothing done,\u201d said Mr. Schnall, the engineer. \u201cIn the real world when you have 20 things to do and you get them done, that\u2019s success. In this world, when you get two things done you get excited.\u201d The Buildings Department has grievances of its own. \u201cSome filing reps will schedule appointments with a plan examiner and won\u2019t have the proper paperwork or just won\u2019t show up,\u201d said a staff member who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.Things are easier at the department now than when he began standing in lines there 25 years ago, Mr. Brotter said.\u201cThe department is always trying to improve things and generally they\u2019ve made the process better, but they haven\u2019t been able to eliminate expediters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a necessary evil.\u201d\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Veto, Sponsors of Port Authority Bill Continue Push for Reform", "Date": "2014-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe veto, announced Saturday by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, defied unanimous support for the bill by all four houses of the two State Legislatures. The governors\u2019 actions also came as prosecutors continue to investigate the politically motivated lane closings at the George Washington Bridge last year, a scandal that tarnished Mr. Christie\u2019s reputation and that of the authority.Despite the unanimity of the legislators in Albany and Trenton, however, and despite the torrent of criticism they unleashed after the governors\u2019 announcement, the bill\u2019s backers said on Sunday that prospects for overriding the veto seemed slim at best. Neither Legislature has accomplished that feat with Mr. Cuomo, who was elected to a second term in November, or during Mr. Christie\u2019s nearly five years in office.And with only days left in the current legislative term in New York, that streak was not likely to be broken. That left officials to sift through the reform recommendations the two governors put forth as they quashed the bill, some of which drew praise for reducing the governors\u2019 political influence at the agency and others of which have already attracted withering criticism.\u201cAn override is not practical,\u201d said Michael Whyland, a spokesman for Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the New York Assembly. \u201cWe still think legislation is needed and we will work with our colleagues in both states to bring increased accountability to the Port Authority.\u201dIn New Jersey, sponsors also conceded that the makeup of the State Senate \u2014 where Democrats hold more seats, but not the supermajority needed to reverse a veto \u2014 was likely to scotch any override. While the legislation passed unanimously, Republican legislators have been known to switch positions on an issue rather than risk crossing Mr. Christie.At least one prominent Republican lawmaker, State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr. of New Jersey, the Republican leader, has already embraced the governors\u2019 alternate solution: a set of recommendations made by a special panel the governors formed in May. Those proposals include adopting a single chief executive, a new mission statement and a new official overseeing ethics \u2014 \u201ca better and enhanced approach,\u201d Mr. Kean said on Sunday.As recently as two years ago, Mr. Christie vetoed a Port Authority transparency bill that had been passed in the wake of a controversial toll increase. That bill\u2019s sponsors, who also sponsor the current bill, talked of an override, but never made good on their threat.Still, on Sunday, the sponsors were mulling other options, including possible legislation at the federal level.The bills vetoed on Saturday were identically written in both states and meant to codify a raft of new financial, ethical and administrative rules for authority officials into law. Legislators said the rules were necessary, in part, to cut the power both governors wield over the authority, including the ability to reward politically connected officials with patronage jobs and allies with lucrative contracts.But the authority\u2019s chairman, John J. Degnan, who served on the panel, dismissed most of the bill\u2019s reforms as outdated or redundant. \u201cI think we\u2019re building an automobile, and they\u2019re trying to put on taillights,\u201d he said, calling the governors\u2019 recommendations \u201ctransformational.\u201dProposals in the bill like establishing a whistle-blower program, creating an inspector general\u2019s office and requiring the authority to hold meetings in public have already taken root, he said, questioning why legislators had failed to consult authority staff members when drawing up the bill.But State Senator Loretta Weinberg of New Jersey, the leader of the Democratic majority and one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said the recommendations had left out important changes, including requiring commissioners to attend certain hearings.\u201cThese two guys let down the people of the states they govern,\u201d she said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t surprise me. They\u2019ve been part and parcel of the excesses at the Port Authority.\u201dMoreover, the bill\u2019s sponsors said, actual laws were needed to hold the authority accountable. Without them, future administrators could simply amend the rules to suit their own interests.\u201cA law is a law is a law,\u201d said Assemblyman James F. Brennan of Brooklyn, who sponsored the bill in New York\u2019s lower chamber, noting the laws could permit state attorneys general to pursue infractions.Mr. Degnan said he agreed, and would be willing to work with lawmakers to write a new bill. Indeed, Mr. Brennan and his New Jersey counterparts seemed resigned to the fact that the bill would have to be resubmitted and passed again.As lawmakers and authority officials sparred over ethics reforms, one of the governors\u2019 other recommendations, eliminating overnight service on the PATH trains, quickly came under fire from the mayors of Hoboken and Jersey City, whose rapid growth has depended on trains to Manhattan. They said reducing commuter options would hobble New Jersey\u2019s struggling economy.Mayor Steven M. Fulop of Jersey City said the veto\u2019s timing suggested the governors\u2019 move was nothing more than a \u201cpower grab.\u201d\u201cThe panel started as a way to root out corruption, not to limit mass transportation,\u201d he said.Jesse McKinley reported from Albany, and Vivian Yee from New York.

{"Headline": "Philippines Pushes Developing Countries to Cut Their Emissions ", "Date": "2014-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is a conscious pivot for the Philippines, one of Asia\u2019s fastest-growing economies. But scientists say the nation is also among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and the Philippine government says it is suffering too many human and economic losses from the burning of fossil fuels.But now, the negotiators say, the Philippines is pledging cuts of its own and urging other developing nations to follow suit, a significant shift that they hope will advance global negotiations.Negotiators here in Peru are working this week on a climate change accord, with the aim of producing one that will be signed by world leaders next year in Paris.\u201cThe thinking of the pivot is \u2014 we\u2019re going to take on commitments and do our part,\u201d said Tony La Vi\u00f1a, a Philippine climate change delegate. \u201cThe call has always been for developed countries to act. But the thinking is simple. If we\u2019re going to get hit every year again and again, how can we call on developed countries to reduce their emissions, but not reduce our own?\u201dThe move follows a joint announcement in November by the United States and China that both countries \u2014 the world\u2019s two largest carbon polluters \u2014 will commit to reducing their fossil fuel emissions in the coming years.Climate negotiators had hoped that the announcement by China would help end an impasse that, for 20 years, has plagued efforts to forge a global deal to stop climate change: Developing economies insist that industrialized nations \u2014 as the world\u2019s historic polluters \u2014 greatly reduce emissions, while poor countries remain exempt from such requirements.The announcement by the Philippines \u201cbuilds on the dramatic U.S.-China announcement two weeks ago,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. \u201cIt shows that there can be a deal in which emerging economies and countries on the growth path from developed to developing are now willing to negotiate.\u201dIn particular, negotiators have hoped that the American deal with China would spur action from India, the world\u2019s third-largest carbon polluter. But more broadly, climate negotiators hope to bring every nation in the world to the table to pledge cuts, regardless of the size of economy.In a clear sign of the shift by the Philippines, delegates from the country said they were breaking away from an informal bloc of nations known as the \u201cLike-Minded Group,\u201d which has for the past two years negotiated together on climate treaties.The group includes nations like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Venezuela and other petro-states, which have long been viewed as stalling the push for an ambitious global deal designed to lower global oil consumption.Instead, the Philippines assumed the chairmanship of another negotiating bloc \u2014 the \u201cMost Vulnerable Countries.\u201d\u201cThe Philippines is thrilled with this opportunity to play a central role in stepping up the joint efforts for vulnerable countries,\u201d said Mary Ann Lucille Sering, secretary of the Philippines climate change commission.\u201cWe have sustained losses every year since 2008 of 5 percent of GDP,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are experiencing tremendous damages and loss of life from typhoons.\u201dClimate change policy experts applauded the country\u2019s new move but suggested that it could prompt an exodus of other countries from the \u201cLike-Minded Group.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re playing a new role,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, an expert on climate change negotiations with the World Resources Institute, a research group. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if other countries, vulnerable countries, pull out of that group.\u201d\u201cHow many more lashings can we bear?\u201d Ms. Sering asked.But even as the Philippine delegation announced its new stance, many noticed the absence of Mr. Sa\u00f1o, who had become the face of the country\u2019s climate efforts.Last year, weeks after super typhoon Haiyan left thousands dead in its wake, Mr. Sa\u00f1o gave an impassioned, weeping speech that electrified the annual United Nations climate change summit meeting, demanding that the world wake up to the impact of fossil fuels on his homeland.Over the next year, he gained world attention as an advocate for his cause, staging a hunger strike, giving speeches to thousands and taking part in a 38-day climate awareness march from Manila to his flattened hometown Tacloban.Mr. Sa\u00f1o\u2019s tactics were widely credited with raising awareness of climate change inside a government with economic ties to some of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers. But they did not necessarily translate to good negotiating practices, his colleagues said. This year, the government did not include Mr. Sa\u00f1o in the official negotiating team. He is in Manila, helping victims of the typhoon.Mr. La Vi\u00f1a, the Philippine negotiator who was also Mr. Sa\u00f1o\u2019s law professor at the University of the Philippines, said he admired his former student\u2019s passion. But Mr. La Vi\u00f1a questioned the efficacy of tearful, angry demands that rich countries make \u201cclimate justice\u201d amends to poor countries.\u201cEveryone\u2019s heard that,\u201d he said.Such an approach, while it may be morally justified, does not play well at the negotiating table, Mr. La Vi\u00f1a said. That is why the Philippine delegation this year is not spotlighting its prominent activist, but rather the fact that it intends to put forward a plan to reduce its own emissions.\u201cIf you change the conversation to what you can do, you get listened to more,\u201d Mr. La Vi\u00f1a said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eastern Germans' Soft Spot for Russia", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 The other day I called the author of an indignant letter to my newspaper to find out why he was so angry at us. It was because, he said, my paper had taken a critical line against Russia over its actions in Crimea and Ukraine. Having grown up in Communist East Germany, he said, gave him a \u201cspecial antenna\u201d for when the news media started to act in conformity with the government \u2014 and against the interests of the people.My paper isn\u2019t alone: Most major news outlets in Germany have criticized Russia, and almost all of them have been accused of being anti-Russian, either having been steered in that direction by American interests or, at least, having uncritically adopted a pro-Western worldview. With much the same furor, countless Germans have denounced government politicians who have dared to speak out against Russia\u2019s actions.Remarkably, many of the most outspoken critics are from Eastern Germany, and are old enough to have lived under Moscow\u2019s oppressive East German puppet state. In Dresden, thousands of pro-Russian protesters have taken to the streets for several weeks, denouncing the \u201cL\u00fcgenpresse\u201d (\u201cliar press\u201d) as part of an out-of-touch political elite. Polls find a significantly friendlier attitude toward Russia among Easterners. In the six states that once made up the German Democratic Republic, 58 percent of respondents want Europe and the United States to stay out of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and to lift the sanctions. In Western Germany, only one-third share this view. The pro-Russian sentiment tracks with a general antipathy toward Western-style capitalism; when asked what they most associate with the phrase \u201cmarket economy,\u201d 82 percent of the Eastern Germans said \u201cexploitation,\u201d as opposed to 43 percent of residents in Western Germany.As someone born in West Germany in the middle of the Cold War, I struggle with such attitudes. If anybody in this country should have no illusions about Moscow-style imperialism, it should be those who have lived through 40 years of Soviet occupation. And if Eastern Germans are so sensitive about disinformation, why don\u2019t they condemn Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s campaign of outright propaganda? The answer may be that Germany has its own little Russia inside itself, a state of mind that we are only now coming to grips with.The fall of the Berlin Wall was, of course, a political liberation, but it turned many lives in Eastern Germany into rubble, too. It wasn\u2019t just a matter of economic and political upheaval. The ease with which one system was replaced by another amounted to an insult to the struggles of many East Germans, even those who never sympathized with Communism. We in Western Germany should have been more sensitive; we will never know what it is like to have the values we grew up with thrown on the scrapheap of history. As justified as the rejection of the totalitarian East German regime might have been politically, Westerners underestimated the psychological effects that went along with the rapid upheaval. One appears to become clear only now: If grand political systems are so easily swapped in and out, it\u2019s easy to conclude that capital-T Truth is a myth.It is telling that the same strong sentiment cannot be found in Poland or the Baltic states, which underwent similarly jarring post-Communist transitions. One reason might be that they were able to see themselves as going through a process of national emancipation, while East Germany was simply absorbed into another state, whose beliefs and practices were not supposed to be questioned. What Eastern Germany got was more convenient \u2014 and lucrative, as it now shares in Europe\u2019s strongest economy \u2014 but psychologically it was much more damaging. Poles can look at themselves as the captains of their own ship; Eastern Germans have had to live with the feeling, right or wrong, that Western elites, like the Soviets before them, are in charge of their fates.Until now, however, that sentiment has been muted, easily ignored when even Russia itself seemed to be moving, in fits and starts, toward accommodation with the West. Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression, and his anti-Western propaganda, has given disgruntled Easterners an outlet. When he decries the West for trying to impose its values on the world, he is reflecting their own experiences within Germany.And it\u2019s no surprise their anger is directed at the news media, which has long dismissed their concerns as so much sour grapes. To them, we Western pen pushers have been so arrogant and wrong in analyzing post-Communist Germany \u2014 why should they trust our analysis of post-Soviet Russia? Likewise, it\u2019s payback time for Western German politicians: You guys stop telling us about the dangers of Russia and its international rights violations, they say; the truth is that, unlike Eastern Germans, you are still under the control of your longtime occupiers, the United States.Which brings me back to the angry reader. His claims to some sort of sixth sense about the media notwithstanding, I do acknowledge that Eastern Germans have a particular allergy to boogeymen: The Communist regime in East Berlin played blame games against the West for many years, and it\u2019s only understandable that they would fear the West is now doing the same thing with Mr. Putin.That\u2019s why German journalists and politicians should not dismiss the Easterners\u2019 anger out of hand. It is not about misplaced nostalgia, or na\u00efvet\u00e9. If we allow our justified criticism of Russia today to become habitual tomorrow, then we will fail to convince skeptical Easterners that we really do want what\u2019s best for the entire country, leaving Germany, and the rest of Europe, much worse off.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street\u2019s Revenge", "Date": "2014-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Masters of the Universe, it turns out, are a bunch of whiners. But they\u2019re whiners with war chests, and now they\u2019ve bought themselves a Congress.Before I get to specifics, a word about the changing politics of high finance.In itself, this rollback is significant but not a fatal blow to reform. But it\u2019s utterly indefensible. The incoming congressional majority has revealed its agenda \u2014 and it\u2019s all about rewarding bad actors.So, about that provision. One of the goals of financial reform was to stop banks from taking big risks with depositors\u2019 money. Why? Well, bank deposits are insured against loss, and this creates a well-known problem of \u201cmoral hazard\u201d: If banks are free to gamble, they can play a game of heads we win, tails the taxpayers lose. That\u2019s what happened after savings-and-loan institutions were deregulated in the 1980s, and promptly ran wild. Dodd-Frank tried to limit this kind of moral hazard in various ways, including a rule barring insured institutions from dealing in exotic securities, the kind that played such a big role in the financial crisis. And that\u2019s the rule that has just been rolled back.Now, this isn\u2019t the death of financial reform. In fact, I\u2019d argue that regulating insured banks is something of a sideshow, since the 2008 crisis was brought on mainly by uninsured institutions like Lehman Brothers and A.I.G. The really important parts of reform involve consumer protection and the enhanced ability of regulators both to police the actions of \u201csystemically important\u201d financial institutions (which needn\u2019t be conventional banks) and to take such institutions into receivership at times of crisis.But what Congress did is still outrageous \u2014 and both sides of the ideological divide should agree. After all, even if you believe (in defiance of the lessons of history) that financial institutions can be trusted to police themselves, even if you believe the grotesquely false narrative that bleeding-heart liberals caused the financial crisis by pressuring banks to lend to poor people, especially minority borrowers, you should be against letting Wall Street play games with government-guaranteed funds. What just went down isn\u2019t about free-market economics; it\u2019s pure crony capitalism.Again, in itself last week\u2019s action wasn\u2019t decisive. But it was clearly the first skirmish in a war to roll back much if not all of the financial reform. And if you want to know who stands where in this coming war, follow the money: Wall Street is giving mainly to Republicans for a reason.Meanwhile, it\u2019s hard to find Republicans expressing major reservations about undoing reform. You sometimes hear claims that the Tea Party is as opposed to bailing out bankers as it is to aiding the poor, but there\u2019s no sign that this alleged hostility to Wall Street is having any influence at all on Republican priorities. So the people who brought the economy to its knees are seeking the chance to do it all over again. And they have powerful allies, who are doing all they can to make Wall Street\u2019s dream come true.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Surprise Call to Scrap South Stream Gas Pipeline Leaves Europe Reeling", "Date": "2014-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite Mr. Putin\u2019s announcement, officials from the European Union, which had lobbied against the project as part of Western sanctions against Russia over Ukraine tensions, said a previously planned meeting between the main European Union countries involved in the project and the bloc\u2019s energy commissioner would still take place next week.\u201cTo comment on whether South Stream is dead is not for us to do,\u201d Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, told reporters on Tuesday in Brussels. \u201cThe commission continues its normal dialogue with Russian as well as all the other parties concerned.\u201dAn abandonment of the South Stream project would be a blow to poor Eastern European countries like Bulgaria and Serbia \u2014 through which the pipeline would run \u2014 both for the construction jobs that the work would mean for their economies and for the energy transport fees they hope to reap from the finished pipeline.A company sustaining some of the most immediate and evident damage on Tuesday was Saipem, an Italian oil field construction company, which has South Stream contracts worth 2.4 billion euros, or about $3 billion.Saipem, whose share price fell more than 10 percent on Tuesday, said in a statement that it had not received notification of the cancellation of the project from South Stream Transport, the Netherlands-based company responsible for building the 580-mile Black Sea segment of South Stream from Russia to Bulgaria, a crucial part of the project.South Stream Transport is 50 percent owned by Gazprom, with the energy companies ENI, EDF of France and Wintershall of Germany holding the rest. Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled natural gas company, is the primary force behind South Stream.Alexei B. Miller, Gazprom\u2019s chief executive, who accompanied the Russian president to Turkey, signed a preliminary deal on Monday with the Turkish company Botas Petroleum Pipeline to build a pipeline of the same size as South Stream under the Black Sea to Turkey. About a fifth of the gas will go to Turkey, while the rest will be delivered to a point on the border with Greece, Gazprom said.Although Europe still depends on Russia for about 30 percent of its natural gas, with about half of the Russian gas currently transported through pipelines crossing Ukraine, the Ukraine crisis has made the European Union intent on reducing that dependence.Some analysts questioned whether Mr. Putin might be bluffing to try to force the European Union and the United States to give up their opposition to South Stream. But others said that canceling the project, or at least delaying it, might be inevitable with the political impasse between the West and Moscow.\u201cIt is a victory for common sense given the state of the Russian economy and the state of Russia\u2019s relations with the E.U.,\u201d said Jonathan Stern, chairman of the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.In an interview, Mr. Stern said the Russian plan to use the South Stream pipeline to bypass Ukraine in bringing gas to the rest of Europe was now either stopped or severely set back.Moscow has long presented the project, proposed in 2007, as making good business sense because it would provide a new route for Russian gas to reach Europe. Washington and Brussels have opposed the project on the grounds that it was a vehicle for cementing Russian influence over southern Europe and for bypassing Ukraine, whose price disputes with Gazprom twice interrupted supplies to Europe in recent years.Mr. Putin, speaking at a news conference with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey on Monday, blamed the European Union for intransigence and said he would redirect the pipeline to Turkey. Analysts including Mr. Stern said that plan made some sense in that Turkey is the one major country in the region that has a growing demand for gas \u2014 unlike much of Europe, where gas use has declined \u2014 and that has huge ambitions to be a trading and transit hub for the fuel.On the other hand, Mr. Stern said, it would take considerable time to build new pipelines to Turkey. While European Union rules do not apply in Turkey, they would still apply once the gas reached a European Union member like Greece.Even before the Ukraine crisis erupted in February, the European Commission was pressuring Russia to comply with European energy and competition laws as a condition for allowing gas to flow to Europe through South Stream. The European rules are meant to rid the region of energy monopolies that control prices and supplies.Russia had opposed that European effort, particularly the proviso that it open its pipelines to competing gas suppliers. Russia has filed a formal complaint against the European rules with the World Trade Organization.If South Stream is not built, Europe will remain dependent on gas moving from Russia through Ukraine. That might be one reason that European Union officials seemed on Tuesday to be trying to keep the door open to the project, with next week\u2019s meeting in Brussels to be attended by the bloc\u2019s senior energy official, Maros Sefcovic.In a note to clients on Tuesday, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein in London wrote that if the project was canceled, Saipem\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization could fall 10 to 15 percent in 2015, or by at least \u20ac130 million.Saipem is one of a handful of companies that own the type of specialized ships that can lay pipeline in deep water. It had three contracts for the first phase of the Black Sea crossing worth a total of \u20ac2.4 billion. The company was expecting to receive about \u20ac1.25 billion in revenue from South Stream in 2015.Analysts say that scrapping the project will add to the gloom in the oil industry, where plunging prices have prompted the major companies to cut spending and squeeze contractors.Nicholas Green, an analyst at Bernstein in London, said that the number of offshore projects given approvals by companies had declined to fewer than 40 this year, from 86 in 2012. \u201cAt $80 per barrel oil,\u201d he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what the number will be\u201d next year.Mr. Green said that Saipem was the company most likely to be hit the hardest by South Stream\u2019s cancellation. In addition, European and Russian steel companies might also be stuck with unused material, he said.Under a cancellation, companies like Saipem may be able to collect substantial penalties from Gazprom and its partners, but those penalties would not make up completely for the lost business.Ms. Itkonen, the European Commission spokeswoman, said on Tuesday that the commission would not be obliged to reimburse European Union member countries for lost potential business.Trevor Sikorski, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London, wrote in an email on Tuesday, \u201cIt seems a game of high-stakes poker with Russia effectively saying they will cancel South Stream.\u201d He added: \u201cThe message was, if you don\u2019t want to play, we will take our ball and go home.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Before the vote, thousands of Greeks joined a peaceful gathering outside the Parliament building to protest austerity policies by successive governments, which have slashed household incomes by a third and pushed unemployment to 26 percent.In a speech before Parliament, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said the blueprint, the first balanced budget in decades, signaled Greece\u2019s gradual emergence from six tough years of recession. \u201cWe are leading the country to a new era where we can offer relief,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are reducing the deficit to zero.\u201dApart from a deficit target of 0.2 percent of gross domestic product, the budget predicts that the Greek economy, which has shrunk by a quarter in the past five years, will expand by 2.9 percent of G.D.P. in 2015 after a timid return to growth this year. It also promises relief, notably 30 percent reductions in a tax on heating oil and an income tax surcharge.The budget remains theoretical. It has not been formally approved by Greece\u2019s so-called troika of international creditors \u2014 the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund \u2014 which has kept the country afloat with two loan programs worth 240 billion euros, about $295 billion, since 2010.The premier\u2019s optimism was dismissed by Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the main leftist opposition Syriza, who said the government was planning more austerity measures after years of painful cuts to salaries and pensions.\u201cThe toughest policies are still to come,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said. \u201cThe demolition is to come.\u201dMr. Tsipras repeated calls for early elections, emphasizing the need for growth-oriented policies and a restructuring of Greece\u2019s debt, which stands at 174 percent of G.D.P.The crucial point of contention in continuing talks between Greece and the troika is a projected budget gap for next year. The creditors believe the government will miss its deficit target, which would oblige authorities to make an estimated \u20ac2.5 billion in additional cuts. The troika is also pushing for Greece to impose delayed economic changes, including a second overhaul of the pension system and revoking labor rights for workers.Another point of dispute is a possible extension to the European part of Greece\u2019s bailout, which ends on Dec. 31. The I.M.F.'s portion runs until March 2016.Greece is lagging on adopting reforms but insists it only needs a few weeks \u2014 a \u201csmall technical extension,\u201d as Mr. Samaras underlined in his speech in Parliament.Greek officials were expected to request the extra time at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on Monday.Greece wants only a brief extension of the European part of its bailout program, as negotiations with the troika continue on further economic reforms and the projected budget gap next year. Athens officials also want to give eurozone parliaments time to approve plans for a precautionary credit line for Greece that the country could tap in 2015, if it cannot successfully raise money in the financial markets.But the Samaras government does not want any extension to continue too long, on fears that it will give its political opponents ammunition to argue that the government remains beholden to the foreign creditors.Eurozone officials, though, favor a longer extension to the bailout \u2014 of about six months \u2014 to ensure oversight of Greece amid political uncertainty there.A looming presidential election due in February has put the government in a bind and has spooked investors. If the coalition of Mr. Samaras fails to garner 180 votes in Parliament to elect a new president, snap general elections must be called. With just 155 members in Parliament, the coalition faces a tough task to win enough support from rival parties. In the event of snap elections, Syriza would win, opinion polls suggest.Amid mounting political and social tensions, there is speculation that the government will advance the presidential elections to January to try to ease the concerns of creditors and investors.Those jitters took hold in October when Mr. Samaras announced he intended to follow the example of Portugal and Ireland, and seek an early exit from the country\u2019s bailout, saying Greece could forgo some \u20ac12 billion in additional I.M.F. support and tap the international markets instead. But the suggestion propelled panic among investors, and Greek bond yields soared over 8 percent. The debate has now shifted to a possible credit line from Brussels, with the I.M.F. in a supervisory role, a deal which would most likely also come with tough conditions.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that the I.M.F.'s participation of a bailout loan was due to end. It is March 2016, not 2103. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steep Slide in Oil Prices Is Blessing for Most", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThe plunge in oil prices \u2014 to about $66 a barrel from over $107 in late June \u2014 has many pundits wringing their hands. They have cited the risks of falling prices and social and political unrest overseas, not to mention the economic threat to the booming mid-American oil basin, running from Texas to North Dakota and Alberta.But if history is any guide, it\u2019s hard to see falling oil prices as anything but good news for everyone whose fortunes aren\u2019t tied to oil, which is to say, most of the world\u2019s population.\u201cEvery time you get a sudden move in oil prices, people say, \u2018This is it, we\u2019re finished,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the author of \u201cThe Quest: Energy, Security and the Remaking of the Modern World,\u201d and vice chairman of the energy consulting firm IHS. \u201cPeople seem to forget that oil is a commodity, and like other commodities, its price moves in cycles set by supply and demand.\u201dAlthough sudden price spikes seem to receive more media and political attention \u2014 Dr. Yergin noted that Teddy Roosevelt warned of the \u201cimminent exhaustion\u201d of oil in 1908 \u2014 oil gluts and price drops seem to happen with similar regularity. In 2008, oil went from $145 a barrel in July to $33 in mid-December, a plunge precipitated by the financial crisis and a collapse in global demand. While $33-a-barrel oil seems cheap now, in 1998 and 1986, oil dropped below $10 a barrel. That makes this latest decline the fourth precipitous fall in the last 30 years.While circumstances are never exactly the same, and the impact of cheap oil can be difficult to isolate from other economic factors, the broad consequence in each of these instances was the same: They stimulated global economic growth. Dr. Yergin estimated that global economic output would grow this year by an additional four-tenths of a percent with oil prices at $80 a barrel. If oil stays below $80, he said, \u201cWe may revise that to five-tenths.\u201d\u201cThe national average for a gallon of gas is already below $3 and headed lower,\u201d said Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service. \u201cConsumers will have more money to spend, and we expect to see this extend through the winter. It may well persist into 2016.\u201dWhile it\u2019s still too early to assess the holiday shopping season, November auto sales surged 4.6 percent from a year earlier to an annualized rate of 17.2 million vehicles. The top three sellers were pickup trucks: the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado and Dodge Ram. While their fuel efficiency has improved over previous models, they\u2019re still gas-guzzlers compared with a Toyota Prius or even a Cadillac sedan.Apart from the benefits for consumers, previous bouts of low oil prices turned out to be great for stock prices, with the exception of the energy sector. In 1986, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 18.67 percent in a bull run that lasted until the recession of 1991. In 1998, the index rose 25.58 percent and 21 percent the year after. And even though stocks collapsed in 2008, they staged a huge rally in 2009.One caveat is that cheap oil may lead to pockets of excess. A year after the 1986 plunge, in October 1987, the stock market crashed on what became known as Black Monday, though it soon recovered. The two years after the 1998 drop led to the peak of the technology bubble, which popped in March 2000. Some pundits are now warning of new asset bubbles in the making.This year\u2019s price decline is most nearly analogous to 1986, Dr. Yergin said. Oil price plunges in 1998 and 2008 were set off by unexpected financial crises \u2014 the failure of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management and the Asian debt crisis in 1998, and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the ensuing Great Recession. In 1986, a surge in new supplies from the North Sea and Alaska, areas beyond the influence of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, drove down prices.This year, the precipitating factor has been the waning of threats of disruption from Russia and the Middle East, slowing economies in Europe and Asia and, above all, a surge in production from the United States and Canada. \u201cThis time, the innovation is fracking,\u201d said Philip Verleger, president of an energy consulting firm and former director of the Office of Energy Policy in the Treasury Department. \u201cThe sudden surge in U.S. oil production has profoundly changed the dynamics of the markets. The oil exporters have lost a third of the market they thought they\u2019d have in 2014.\u201dOPEC met on Thanksgiving, but shocked markets when its members didn\u2019t even pay lip service to the need for production cuts or price discipline. The price of oil, traded on international markets, fell about 6.5 percent that day. \u201cTheir strategy is to let prices fall and squeeze out the higher-cost producers,\u201d Mr. Verleger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle for market share.\u201dLow oil prices aren\u2019t an unmitigated blessing for the United States, since it\u2019s now the world\u2019s largest oil producer and may soon emerge as an oil exporter. OPEC\u2019s strategy may be to let prices fall to a point where North American shale and tar sands production cease to be economically viable. \u201cBut that\u2019s a dangerous game,\u201d Mr. Cinquegrana said. \u201cThe shale producers keep lowering their costs of production thanks to technology.\u201d Even Saudi Arabia needs $98-a-barrel oil to balance its budget, estimated Edward Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup Global Markets.For Saudi Arabia and other major oil-producing countries, \u201coil production and exports are a primary source of government revenues,\u201d Mr. Morse wrote in a recent research report. \u201cThe oil prices required for oil revenues to balance government budgets are far higher than the $70-90 range, with several countries requiring oil prices of well above $100.\u201dHe estimates Venezuela needs $161-a-barrel oil to break even this year after decades of cronyism and mismanagement of its energy sector under the leftist government of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cVenezuela is a world-class example of economic mismanagement,\u201d Dr. Yergin noted. Oil prices below $80 a barrel \u201cwill be devastating.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s Russia, which acknowledged this week that its economy had fallen into recession as a result of Western penalties over Ukraine and falling oil revenue. Over half of Russia\u2019s national budget is financed by oil and gas revenue. This week, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, canceled Russia\u2019s long-sought gas pipeline to Europe through Bulgaria and Serbia, which would have bypassed Ukraine.Both Mr. Putin and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez came to power in the wake of economic turmoil brought on by the plunging oil prices in 1998. Mr. Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin in 1999 after Russia defaulted on its sovereign debt. He vowed to restore Russia\u2019s financial credibility and modernize its economy. Whether the latest oil price plunge and recession have any impact on his geopolitical adventurism remains to be seen. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was elected in 1998 in the face of social unrest and falling oil revenue after OPEC imposed cuts in output.Both Mr. Putin and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, have been vocal critics of the United States. Two other nemeses of the United States \u2014 Iran, which gets half its budget revenue from oil exports, and the militant group ISIS, which finances much of its activity from oil sales \u2014 will also suffer from low prices. The geopolitical consequences of low oil prices seem so aligned with the United States\u2019 foreign policy interests that \u201csome conspiracy theorists are saying that the U.S. and the Saudis want to punish the Russians and Iran,\u201d Mr. Cinquegrana said.Moreover, two of the world\u2019s largest emerging economies \u2014 China and India \u2014 are net energy importers, and their economies should benefit from low prices.History suggests there will be far-reaching consequences from the latest plunge. \u201cYou have to keep your eye on potential social and political unrest,\u201d Dr. Yergin said. \u201cWe\u2019re just at the beginning of this cycle, and there are likely to be unforeseen consequences. But for the global economy as a whole, my view is this is very positive. Cheaper gas prices in November mean more money in cash registers in December.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled part of the title of Dr. Yergin\u2019s book. It is \u201cThe Quest: Energy, Security and the Remaking of the Modern World,\u201d not \u201cThe Qwest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Having Dozed Off, Lexus Wakes Up With a Start", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel10 PhotosEven as Lexus lost its lead in luxury sales to BMW and Mercedes-Benz, largely because of self-inflicted dullness, a philosophical question lingered: Do Lexus devotees even want exciting cars? Toyota\u2019s race-driving chairman, Akio Toyoda, has vowed to forge ahead regardless, amping up the design and performance of Lexus, the company\u2019s premium division. The largely refreshing RC coupe will help to test that proposition, especially in the guise of the 467-horsepower RC F.While many luxury coupes appear restrained, this Tokyo prowler looks unleashed. Its Predator mouth might as well drip green blood. The head-trip styling seems inspired by an anime robot factory.To eyes that prefer a demure look, it\u2019s a bit much. But the Lexus consistently wowed the public on streets in New York and Michigan. And I\u2019m willing to cut this coupe some slack, because the RC shows that Lexus is taking genuine risks as it seeks a potentially fruitful design language. Say what you want, but the RC is anything but another boring Lexus. And I love that this new model refuses to put on a sedate German suit in an attempt to blend in at the club where Audi, Benz and BMW hang out.The iconoclastic approach extends to the cabin, which blends luxury and technology in an intimate layout that recalls Lexus\u2019s rare exotic sports car, the $375,000 LFA, including chronograph-style digital gauges with an enormous, configurable central tachometer. Cocooning sport seats display ultrasupportive winged side bolsters and \u201cintegrated foaming\u201d construction in which the upholstery and seat foam are molded together in a single process. They look like something Captain Kirk would choose for his bachelor pad. The rear seat is constricting in two-plus-two fashion, but the front seats slide forward electrically and reposition themselves once passengers are snug in the back.The only real negative is the mouse-style touch pad for navigation, audio and vehicle functions. To be honest, it\u2019s an industry abomination, a size 16 Achilles\u2019 heel. Fussy and beyond distracting, it requires the precise caress of a Casanova to operate while the car is in motion. Unlike most sport coupes, the RC is not engineered as a two-door version of a donor sedan. Instead, the RC combines the front chassis section of the midsize GS sedan, the stiff central backbone of the IS C convertible and the rear of the all-new IS compact sedan.If the Lexus looks like a video game come to life, the car\u2019s engineers focused on a real world in which crashing and burning doesn\u2019t earn you a microwave burrito and a second try.Spurred around the Monticello Motor Club in upstate New York, the Lexus was evidently tuned to allow anyone \u2014 from novice to expert \u2014 to go fast and have fun. The tire grip is monumental, as are the brakes. Push beyond the limits, and the Lexus segues into safe, predictable understeer. But don\u2019t think this Lexus is slow or dumbed-down. The ready-to-rumble 5-liter V8, strengthened from its last appearance in the IS F sedan, pulls like mad to 7,300 r.p.m. and never runs out of breath. The RC F scampers to 60 m.p.h. in a crackling 4.3 seconds, and Lexus claims a top speed of 170 m.p.h. The fuel economy \u2014 16 m.p.g. in town, 25 on the highway \u2014 is par for this class of high-performance coupe.The 8-speed paddle-shifted transmission is a brilliant wingman, about as fast and frolicsome as a conventional torque-convertor automatic can get. Summon the Sport mode on the console\u2019s oversize, tactile rotary dial, and the transmission applies artificial intelligence, reading g forces to decide when a shift is necessary. Oh, and the Lexus sounds glorious, a burly, naturally aspirated V8 rumble that\u2019s impossible to fake.Driven on another racetrack in western Michigan, the Lexus ran neck-and-neck laps with the formidable BMW M4 coupe, even though the Lexus is chubbier, with a curb weight of nearly two tons. The RC F also costs decisively less. My test car, wearing a lurid shade of blue, started at $63,325 and reached $73,970 with options. The last M4 that I drove topped $85,000. Over a week in New York and environs, the RC F also proved easy to live with, perfectly willing to ooze through traffic like a traditional Lexus. It\u2019s not at all high-strung, and the ride on cratered pavement is smoother than the BMW\u2019s.On the track, I also drove the surprisingly capable RC 350 models, which share their 3.5-liter V6, rated at 306 horsepower, with the IS 350 sedan. Those more affordable RCs start at $43,715. The price rises to $50,630 for the RC F-Sport AWD, which features an adaptive suspension and four-wheel-steering. As fast, adhesive and athletic as the RC may be, there is something a bit methodical about its performance: This Lexus never seems to sweat. If the worst thing one can say about the RC is that it feels too stable and confident at rocketing speeds on a track, then Lexus must be doing something right. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Limbo, a City in China Faces Life After Graft", "Date": "2014-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by5 PhotosOn Friday, state news media reported a new wave of arrests, with nine more L\u00fcliang officials detained. The reports say the arrests are part of a new emphasis on cleaning up local governments, where officials have extensive powers and few restraints.But in L\u00fcliang and elsewhere, Mr. Xi\u2019s prolonged, nationwide crackdown on corruption has also unsettled the party establishment and its allies in business. Even among ordinary residents, there is concern about what it might mean for jobs and growth, because private businessmen have been targeted alongside government and party officials.\u201cIn this part of China, officials are held in the palms of the coal barons,\u201d said one shopkeeper, who asked that his name not be used so he could speak freely about a politically sensitive subject. \u201cBut these business leaders were capable \u2014 they made us prosper.\u201dFor much of China\u2019s growth era, party officials and businesses have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship, with policy concessions and market access granted in exchange for corporate support \u2014 sometimes direct payoffs, but also more subtle backing of state projects and priorities. Combined with China\u2019s insatiable appetite for coal, that formula helped power L\u00fcliang to its first glimpses of prosperity in generations. But there is a sense now that the rules are changing, with the consequences for the economy uncertain.\u201cIn the past, with corruption, you could pay an official and get something done,\u201d said Mao Yushi, a prominent economist in Beijing. \u201cBut now the officials won\u2019t accept money, but don\u2019t approve things either.\u201dNestled in the mountains of the dusty Loess Plateau, L\u00fcliang is best known for having served as a base for the Red Army during World War II. Its valleys are lined with roads blackened by coal that shakes free of the trucks that roll day and night from the mountains to coking plants and steel works. Every few dozen miles, the mountains open up and small urban areas appear. One is Zhongyang, where Mr. Zhang once held court.A short, bullish man who had worked in local government for 39 years, Mr. Zhang controlled the permits that businesses needed to run mines or factories. He rose through the ranks to become deputy chief of the L\u00fcliang region. As the corruption investigation widened, he resigned in March and has been in detention since.The money did more than just grease the wheels of commerce. It also appeared to undermine the Communist Party\u2019s appointment and promotion process. Inner-party voting procedures were rigged, Caixin found, with oligarchs like Mr. Xing channeling money through candidates to pay off the higher-ups who made the decisions. In one case, a government post cost about $650,000.Residents said Mr. Zhang poured his earnings into several mansions, including a huge mountaintop estate. On a recent visit, the entrance to the estate was bricked off, but the mansion was still an impressive sight: Low-slung, made of gray bricks, it hugged the mountain and featured a private park at the summit, complete with banquet halls designed to resemble the cave dwellings still used by many poorer people in Shanxi.Mr. Zhang also had a reputation for promoting his friends and relatives. His wife went from a clerical job to a post as a senior government adviser; his family doctor became the head of a county hospital; and his children\u2019s private tutor was named a school principal. Another relative became the owner of a local coal mine, residents said.\u201cWhat can we ordinary people do?\u201d asked a 45-year-old hardware store owner who asked to be identified only by his surname, Xu, and who could scarcely contain his contempt when asked about Mr. Zhang. \u201cIs there any official who isn\u2019t corrupt?\u201dBut if party officials suspected of corruption are deeply unpopular, residents express more sympathy for the entrepreneurs accused of bankrolling them.Mr. Xing, for example, remains widely respected in L\u00fcliang. Though he has been pilloried on the Chinese Internet over his daughter\u2019s extravagant wedding, people here still speak of him with pride as a local rags-to-riches success and a savvy, hands-on tycoon who created real wealth in the region.Born to impoverished corn farmers in a remote mountain village, Mr. Xing, 47, managed to test into the province\u2019s best university. But unlike most graduates in the 1980s, he turned down a government job and moved back to L\u00fcliang to seek his fortune in China\u2019s newly emerging private sector.But his defenders note that the mine was losing money, and that Mr. Xing invested in new technology and for several years lived just outside the mine gates to make sure it was being run properly. \u201cMy wages doubled after he took over the mine,\u201d said a former mine employee who now runs a motorcycle shop nearby. \u201cHe was a man of his word.\u201dWhether Mr. Xing paid a fair price or not, his timing was impeccable. He bought into coal just as China was going through its fastest phase of growth, and just as the government ended price controls on coal used to produce energy. The result was a boom in coal use and profitability for coal mines.But the local economy benefited, too. In 2000, L\u00fcliang was one of China\u2019s poorest regions. By 2010, its main city had one of the strongest economies in the province. In addition to employing tens of thousands, Mr. Xing\u2019s company, Liansheng, renovated parks and built new schools.\u201cI don\u2019t know what he did, but this is the best high school in the area,\u201d said Chen Xialu, who was waiting outside the Liulin No. 4 High School. \u201cIt was built by Xing Libin and Liansheng, so we are grateful.\u201dThe prosperity, though, was fragile. Mr. Xing borrowed heavily to expand. The debt could be serviced as long as coal prices were high, but they began to fall in 2012 as the economy slowed. Mr. Xing sought to diversify, using his close ties with local officials to lease farmland and build apartment blocks, small dams, walnut plantations and a paved, solar lamp-lit road from the city to his home village.Mr. Xing was detained in March, and his whereabouts is unknown.\u201cHe was capable,\u201d said Wang Zhenhua, a 66-year-old native of Mr. Xing\u2019s home village, Huaishugao. \u201cHe built all this and had great ideas. He was just a bit too corrupt.\u201dKiki Zhao contributed research from L\u00fcliang, and Chen Jiehao from Beijing.Advertisement"}

At the other extreme, people see Beijing\u2019s policies as the planet\u2019s best hope: With its aggressive plans to green its economy, backed by the mighty Communist machine, China is the foremost investor in renewable energy. The truth lies in between.Indeed, China\u2019s commitments last month laid the groundwork for the deal reached on Sunday at the annual climate talkfest in Lima, Peru. As part of a global accord, developing countries agreed collectively for the first time to accept limits on their own emissions.As all this shows, cleaning up their smog-ridden cities is a top priority for China\u2019s leaders, who are anxious to quell public disquiet over dangerous pollution. Yet they also strongly guard their national sovereignty. So China\u2019s willingness to sign up to an emissions cap in an international forum bolsters hopes for a worldwide pact next year in Paris building off the progress made in Lima. (Previous attempts to forge agreement, at Copenhagen in 2009, stumbled in the face of intractable disputes between the developed and developing worlds over who should foot the bill for preventing dangerous levels of warming.)But seen in another light, China\u2019s latest pronouncements have skillfully shifted pressure onto other developing countries by making commitments that may appear bold but in fact don\u2019t go far beyond Beijing\u2019s earlier pledges.And the timing, just weeks before the Lima conference, was ideal: Much of the recent media coverage consequently focused on India and other polluters that are reluctant to act against global warming. They will find it harder to resist demands to do more; China, meanwhile, is free to call on rich countries to pony up more money to combat climate change.Not a bad thing, perhaps, if China were committing to deeper sacrifices than those it has already made. But the latest Chinese goals are not ambitious.China is already on course to draw 15 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020, as it has long intended; aiming for 20 percent by 2030 is hardly a stretch. Based on the growing weight Chinese policy makers give to combating pollution, many researchers had predicted that emissions would peak around 2030. My colleagues and I at the Economist Intelligence Unit were already forecasting coal use to plateau by 2020. (How high emissions will climb before they crest is another vital question: On this, China remains quiet.)Thus, China\u2019s plans look suspiciously like a clever recasting of forecasts as (nonbinding) targets.Skepticism is also in order when it comes to the methods by which China means to address climate change. Even some charged with running China\u2019s current experiments in carbon trading fear that rushing the establishment of a national system by 2016, as proposed, is impossible. Seven carbon-trading pilot programs have made patchy progress. Some started only after long delays.Even in mainland China\u2019s chief financial hub, all is not smooth. During a recent visit to the Shanghai climate exchange, my host apologized for the lack of trading. Following the end of the first annual \u201ccompliance\u201d period in June, by which time companies had to adhere to emissions limits or buy extra permits to pollute, activity had for a while dried up altogether. Prices sagged at disappointingly low levels. Such teething problems are unsurprising, but they counsel caution about the pace at which a national program should be rolled out.Stirring deeper doubts are China\u2019s notorious problems with transparency and statistical accuracy. Could emissions be rigorously monitored? In Lima, China fended off calls for electronic monitoring of its emissions-reduction plans as part of the United Nations process. Owing partly to Chinese resistance, the weakened Lima accord failed to set out strict rules on the information countries must give about their emissions-reduction commitments under a new treaty.Then there is the symbiotic relationship between the government and state-owned firms. Would permits to pollute be fairly apportioned and scrupulously enforced? \u201cThe last thing we want is a trading scheme with Chinese characteristics,\u201d said a veteran carbon financier.None of this is to deny China\u2019s efforts on the environment. But Beijing needs to do more. If it is serious about curbing global warming, China should spell out how high it expects its emissions to rise and strive to set an earlier timing for that peak. For outsiders dealing with China on climate change the motto must be praise but verify \u2014 and keep pushing for more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sucker\u2019s Game for New York", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialGov. Andrew Cuomo and New York\u2019s pliable Legislature kowtowed to the gambling industry last year and, using loaded language on the ballot referendum, tricked the electorate into changing the State Constitution to allow casino gambling on the dubious premise that it would bolster the state economy. Fortunately, it rejected the worst of the 16 proposals the gambling industry put forward \u2014 a thoroughly misguided plan for a massive casino complex adjacent to Sterling Forest, an important watershed and recreational area only 40 miles from New York City. It instead chose one site near Albany, in Schenectady; one near Monticello, next to the former home of a fabled Catskills resort; and one in the Finger Lakes area of Tyre. Slot parlors are a wretched deal for most communities, and it is even more appalling to see them used as life support for Long Island\u2019s Off-Track Betting Corporations, which are patronage schemes tied to an ailing horse-racing industry. Nassau County, having been run into a financial ditch under Republican leadership, is under a financial control board and is desperate for cash. Suffolk\u2019s Off-Track Betting Corporation, which is emerging from bankruptcy, is similarly itching for a cash infusion. Taken together, the three upstate casinos and the two Long Island slot parlors mean that the glut of gambling facilities in the Northeast is about to get much, much worse. The regional gambling market is already brutally competitive. Four of Atlantic City\u2019s 12 casinos have closed, and a fifth filed for bankruptcy last month. The big tribal casinos in Connecticut are faltering. There are already five tribal casinos in upstate New York and nine slot parlors at state racetracks. The idea that five new facilities can bring in sustainable revenue seems the stuff of fantasy. What Long Island and upstate New York need is a government that nurtures responsible growth while also tending to the interests of the working class, the elderly and the poor. Instead, its elected officials are addicted to quick fixes and seemingly painless revenue streams. Legalized gambling is one of those illusions, pushed as a source of economic development by politicians who can\u2019t come up with anything better. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slide in Fuel Costs Lifts Profits for Airlines, but Fares Won\u2019t Fall", "Date": "2014-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA recovering economy and rapidly falling oil prices have provided some breathing room for airlines in recent months, bolstering profits and allowing carriers to buy new planes or upgrade their higher-end service.But while motorists have seen gasoline prices fall at the pump, air travelers should not expect to see fares, or even fuel surcharges, drop anytime soon.Airlines were quick to slap extra fuel charges on their international flights when oil prices spiked a few years ago. Today, those can reach about $500 for a round-trip international flight, for instance, between Newark and Frankfurt, or Los Angeles and Tokyo. But with oil prices down more than 40 percent since June, airlines have been a lot slower in cutting back those surcharges, particularly at a time when they have no trouble filling planes at current fares.Fuel accounts for nearly half an airline\u2019s costs. But airline executives are unsure where oil prices will settle or how sustained the downturn in the oil market will be. Alexandre de Juniac, the chairman of Air France-KLM, estimated that oil might hover between $70 and $80 a barrel next year, although he added, \u201cObviously, no one really knows.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a reason that our fares probably won\u2019t be increased,\u201d he said. He noted that for European carriers, the drop in oil prices had been offset by the relative decline in the value of the euro against the dollar.Oil futures for the American benchmark settled at $60.94 a barrel in New York on Wednesday, down 4.5 percent, their lowest level in more than five years. The drop has taken many experts by surprise. It was set off by sustained growth in domestic oil supplies in the United States along with a weak global economy.This has translated into a windfall for the airlines.The International Air Transport Association, an industry group based in Geneva, estimated that the industry\u2019s profits would grow 26 percent next year, to reach a record $25 billion, not adjusted for inflation. The group expects $19.9 billion in collective profits in 2014. In 2013, the industry had nearly $11 billion in profits.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the recent fall in the oil price is a relief for airlines,\u201d Tony Tyler, the association\u2019s director general, said on Wednesday.The trade group, which represents most of the world\u2019s airlines, said its 2015 forecast was based on an average price of $85 a barrel. That would be the lowest fuel price for the industry since 2010.While consumers expect price drops to be reflected quickly in the price of gas at the pump, there is typically a lag with ticket prices. One reason is that airlines buy their fuel in advance, to hedge against higher costs. But if prices fall, this can effectively lock them into higher fixed prices for several months.\u201cIf you\u2019ve already bought and paid for your turkey for next Thanksgiving, and prices come down in the meantime, you won\u2019t get any benefit from any subsequent reduction in turkey prices,\u201d said John Strickland, an independent airline consultant in London. In addition, he said that airlines \u201calso swallowed the pain of rapidly rising prices in the last year or so,\u201d which have not been fully reflected in fares.Another reason is that airlines have little incentive to reduce their fares now. Many flights are full, and carriers are reinvesting much of their profit in the business, paying dividends to shareholders or giving bonuses to employees.Airlines insist that air travel remains a bargain, even at today\u2019s prices, once adjusted for inflation. For instance, while consumer prices have increased 35 percent since 2000, airfares have risen 22 percent, including extra bag fees and other ancillary revenue, according to Airlines for America, a trade group. Operating expenses for the nine publicly traded American passenger carriers in the first nine months of the year rose 3.1 percent as declines in fuel costs were offset by higher costs elsewhere, the group said.United States airlines paid $115 million less in fuel costs for the first nine months of 2014 compared with last year, a 0.3 percent reduction, the group said.John Heimlich, the trade group\u2019s chief economist, said airlines were reinvesting at the highest rate in 13 years. This includes improvements onboard the planes, enhanced airport facilities and amenities, and rewards to employees.\u201cIt is critical to make the investments now and capitalize on the current environment,\u201d he said.Many of the improvements have been directed at the airlines\u2019 most lucrative passengers, who are flying in business class or paying for full-fare coach seats. The majority of travelers who are seeking regular or cheaper tickets in coach are not seeing many of these benefits.Passengers with those tickets, though, will not be able to book their seats in advance and will not be able to refund or change those tickets.American Airlines announced this week that it would spend $2 billion to improve customer experience at the airport and inside its planes. Part of that investment includes adding more lie-flat seats for business class passengers and rolling out Wi-Fi satellite connections for its international flights.Air France-KLM is spending more than $1.2 billion to refurbish planes, add services and modernize its airport lounges and ground services. Air France is getting new business-class seats on its planes.\u201cThe rules of the game have changed,\u201d Mr. de Juniac, the Air France-KLM chairman, said during a brief visit to New York, where Air France recently reopened its business-class lounge at Kennedy International Airport. The facility now includes a spa where passengers can receive a facial treatment, shower or a meal before boarding their trans-Atlantic flights to Paris.\u201cWe have to do this because our competitors are very good and we have to be better,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of the Chinese Philanthropist", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsTurning Point: Asia is expected to become the region with the most millionaires.I never dreamed that one day I would become a philanthropist. I was born in Beijing in 1965, and spent my teenage years working long hours as a factory girl, sewing collars and buttons onto dress shirts in Hong Kong. Today, I am the chief executive of SOHO China, the country\u2019s largest prime office property developer.China has seen rapid economic growth over the past three decades, and it is now one of the world\u2019s fastest growing producers of billionaires \u2014 242 and counting, according to Forbes \u2014 which is extraordinary considering that just over a decade ago, there were none.Though many Chinese have grown wealthy, few have embraced the practice of philanthropy in a manner and scale that is comparable with their counterparts in the West. But I believe we are on the cusp of change. With a new generation of Chinese who feel grateful for the opportunities the country\u2019s growth has provided, social consciousness is rising, contributing to a growing urge to give back in innovative ways and to contribute to the nation\u2019s future and to the betterment of our society.My generation\u2019s success stories are unique. We were born into Communist China, at a time when almost nobody had access to material wealth. The guiding philosophy was to \u201cserve the people,\u201d but no one had the economic means to give back to society, nor were there many philanthropic foundations. It was an impossible time to have a culture or tradition of philanthropy nurtured by the generous individuals and families like the Rockefellers or the Carnegies. There were no philanthropic role models under communism. China was completely insulated from the rest of the world, with very little access to outside information. As children of that society, we could not have imagined the possibility of becoming a philanthropist.But in 1978, Deng Xiaoping opened China\u2019s doors to economic reform and capital markets. China\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit was reborn and my generation blossomed. We studied abroad, we started businesses and many of us prospered in unprecedented ways.For many Chinese of my generation, our first point of contact with Western philanthropy was the financial aid we received when we studied abroad. Very few of us had money \u2014 most only had raw ambition. We were \u201cPHDs\u201d: poor, hungry and determined. Financial aid transformed our lives.I studied in the United Kingdom on a full scholarship in the 1980s, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree from Sussex University and a master\u2019s from Cambridge University. My education would eventually lead to a job on Wall Street, and then in 1995 I returned to China and founded SOHO China with my husband, Pan Shiyi, who grew up in rural western China. He had also attended university, which carried him away from village life and into our growing and changing nation\u2019s business community.That opportunity to study was the most dramatic turning point in my life. My education opened my eyes to the world, provided me with the academic grooming necessary to pursue an international career, and gave me the courage to return to China, build an enterprise and innovate. Without financial aid, I, and so many other Chinese who have played various roles in advising, consulting and building the modern China we know today, may have never had the chance to attend university.In the decade after I returned to China, many of my peers returned as well. China became increasingly globalized, joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 and preparing for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The economy boomed. At the same time, the Internet and social media gained remarkable momentum. There was a push for increasing transparency and pressure mounted on businesses and the government to become more socially responsible now that China was on the world stage.In those early days of post-economic-reform, most philanthropic giving went to disaster relief and to the construction of schools in remote areas of China. My husband and I joined that philanthropic wave, giving to aid victims of the Asian tsunami disaster in 2004. We then started donating funds to help build schools in China\u2019s highly impoverished western provinces of Qinghai and Gansu, where my husband was born and raised. We also gave to the Sichuan earthquake relief efforts in 2008 \u2014 a disaster that took the lives of nearly 70,000 people, devastating communities in southwestern China. The suffering of those affected prompted an outpouring of donations from the public, and philanthropy became a topic that people understood, discussed and debated.At that point, the giving my husband and I were involved in was sporadic and focused on dire need and immediate solutions. It became clear that this Band-Aid approach did not work, since many communities required long-term aid to deal with chronic problems. We needed a cause that would capture our long-term philanthropic aspirations. Looking back on how my education had opened new doors for me, I knew that was the cause closest to my heart: I believe that education is the primary factor in improving social mobility.My husband and I founded the SOHO China Foundation in 2005, which focuses on improving the quality of education in underprivileged communities. Our first project was a teacher-training program in rural western China. Over the course of five years we brought more than 1,700 teachers from rural communities to Beijing for summer training, improving the level of education provided to more than 80,000 primary school students. When we learned of the poor sanitary conditions at the schools, we also built 45 school toilets, impacting more than 35,000 students.As I worked with the rural schools, I saw that these students have few opportunities. China\u2019s growth has been accompanied by an intensified divide in income distribution, with large cities prospering much more than smaller cities and rural areas. Many wealthy Chinese send their children abroad to study, but countless outstanding rural students lose out on such opportunities due to a lack of financial means. There is a danger that the chance for Chinese youth to study abroad will become purely privilege-based instead of merit-based. Some of our best students are now so intimidated by the economic burden of pursuing a world-class education that they don\u2019t even apply to top universities.It is with this understanding that we decided to create the SOHO China Scholarships, pledging to endow $100 million in financial aid scholarships for Chinese undergraduate students attending leading international universities. Our first gift agreement of $15 million was signed with Harvard University and our second gift agreement of $10 million was signed with Yale University.This instantly created controversy in China. On the one hand, we received overwhelming encouragement, while on the other our decision to partner with international institutions instead of with domestic universities was heatedly questioned. Philanthropy became a hot topic online and across social media.My answer to those questioning our choice: The most striking feature of our time is globalization. It is important for China to be integrated with the rest of the world. Our aim is to enable China\u2019s best and brightest to act as a bridge between China and other nations \u2014 an important tool for modernizing the Middle Kingdom.When I look back at our decision to create the scholarships in 2014, I recall the time I met Warren Buffett and the deep impression he left on me. Buffett and Bill Gates had traveled to China in 2010 to encourage high-net-worth Chinese to think about philanthropy. Buffett explained that he had always given, and then one day he realized that the rate at which he was giving was slower than the rate at which he was earning money. He was 80 years old at the time, so he decided to entrust a large part of his fortune to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. I walked away inspired by the vision behind his large-scale, highly impactful giving, and ultimately thought, \u201cDon\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late.\u201dSoon after the announcement of our SOHO China Scholarships, I heard that my friend the Hong Kong property developer Ronnie Chan and his family made a $350 million gift to Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health, and a $20 million gift to his alma mater, the University of Southern California. I have also heard that Jack Ma of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant, along with co-founder Joe Tsai, have said that they will commit 2 percent of Alibaba\u2019s equity to a charitable trust.I believe that the year 2014 is a turning point in Chinese philanthropy. This tradition is finally getting the impetus it needs to flourish because of an emerging group of Chinese entrepreneurs who are socially conscious, globally engaged and hoping to make a positive and lasting impact on China and the world \u2014 they\u2019re not looking for quick fixes. They feel responsible.With the help of financial aid, I went from factory worker to university student, then became an entrepreneur and eventually, chief executive of my own company. But of my achievements, I am most proud of my work as a philanthropist, and I hope to continue with it for the rest of my days. The world is waiting to see what Chinese philanthropists will do next.Advertisement"}

The malls seemed less crowded than usual, the people glummer. There was even less Muzak in the air. And, in a way, that\u2019s not surprising: All year Americans have been bombarded with dire news reports portraying a world out of control and a clueless government with no idea what to do.Yet if you look back at what actually happened over the past year, you see something completely different. Amid all the derision, a number of major government policies worked just fine \u2014 and the biggest successes involved the most derided policies. You\u2019ll never hear this on Fox News, but 2014 was a year in which the federal government, in particular, showed that it can do some important things very well if it wants to. As it turned out, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, despite some early missteps, knew what they were doing, which shouldn\u2019t be surprising: The Centers have a lot of experience in, well, controlling disease, epidemics in particular. And while the Ebola virus continues to kill many people in parts of Africa, there was no outbreak here.Finally, there\u2019s the hidden-in-plain-sight triumph of Obamacare, which is just finishing up its first year of full implementation. It\u2019s a tribute to the effectiveness of the propaganda campaign against health reform \u2014 which has played up every glitch, without ever mentioning that the problem has been solved, and invented failures that never happened \u2014 that I fairly often encounter people, some of them liberals, who ask me whether the administration will ever be able to get the program to work. Apparently nobody told them that it is working, and very well. And there\u2019s more. For example, at the end of 2014, the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy, which tries to contain threats like Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia or the Islamic State rather than rushing into military confrontation, is looking pretty good.The common theme here is that, over the past year, a U.S. government subjected to constant bad-mouthing, constantly accused of being ineffectual or worse, has, in fact, managed to accomplish a lot.

What can I do? How can I make money?\u201cYou need me to dig ditches? Erect billboards?\u201d he continued, gathering steam as his language turned coarse. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it, because if I then find out that someone else did it \u2014 do you understand? \u2014 then it becomes something unpleasant.\u201dThat conversation and scores of others, intercepted by investigators, have added a splash of color to an otherwise dark two-year inquiry that resulted last week in the arrest of Mr. Carminati and 36 others accused of bullying their way into dozens of lucrative public tenders in the Italian capital.Even for a country where corruption is taken for granted as a part of daily life, the revelations have stunned citizens \u2014 for uncovering a wholly new criminal ring smack in the heart of the capital, and for the staggering array of charges involving politicians across the spectrum.The inquiry has blossomed into a national scandal and a reminder that virtually no corner of Italy is immune to criminal penetration. It has also raised fresh questions about Italy\u2019s ability ever to reform itself and fulfill the demands for fiscal responsibility demanded by its eurozone partners.The widespread and unchecked corruption of public money revealed by the inquiry has helped bloat Italy\u2019s national debt to one of the highest levels in Europe.Mr. Carminati and his associates are accused of infiltrating contracts for a wide assortment of tasks including garbage collection and park maintenance. The charges cover a gamut of activities \u2014 vote rigging, usury, extortion and embezzlement. Rome\u2019s chief prosecutor, Giuseppe Pignatone, told Italy\u2019s anti-Mafia commission Thursday that new operations were imminent.Mr. Carminati and his ring, prosecutors charge, profited even from the national immigration emergency that has swelled Italy\u2019s shores with refugees fleeing war and poverty, by muscling in on immigrant and refugee reception centers.\u201cDo you have any idea how much I make on the immigrants?\u201d one purported associate, Salvatore Buzzi, is heard saying in another of the prosecutors\u2019 recordings. \u201cDrug trafficking is not as profitable.\u201dMr. Buzzi is head of a social cooperative that managed services at the temporary reception centers and Roma camps, a business he claimed was worth 40 million euros, or about $50 million, to the criminal organization.He and dozens of other city administrators and civil servants, along with politicians, businesspeople and convicted criminals, have now been swept up in the widening investigation.For a week now, Italian newspapers \u2014 culling primarily from a nearly 1,200-page arrest warrant \u2014 have churned out fresh revelations that read like a lurid 19th-century serial novel of criminal intrigue and depravity, even exploiting society\u2019s weakest links.Prosecutors dubbed the new crime gang Mafia Capitale, comparing the organization to Italy\u2019s traditional mobs: the Mafia, the Camorra and the \u2019Ndrangheta, for its use of intimidation tactics.The Italian news media, however, rechristened the inquiry as the \u201cMiddle-earth investigation,\u201d an allusion to the fictional universe of J. R. R. Tolkien, elaborating on Mr. Carminati\u2019s purported worldview.\u201cIt\u2019s the Middle-earth theory, cump\u00e1,\u201d Mr. Carminati told an associate in another wiretapped conservation, using the southern Italian slang for friend. \u201cAs they say, the living are above, and the dead are below. And we\u2019re in the middle.\u201dMr. Pignatone, the prosecutor, interpreted the concept at a news conference last week. \u201cThis is Carminati\u2019s organization,\u201d he said. \u201cIt speaks with the world above\u201d \u2014 alluding to the social strata that count \u2014 \u201cit speaks with the world below, the criminal world. And it serves the first world using the second.\u201dMr. Carminati was not unknown to law enforcement officials. He was convicted years ago for his association in the late 1970s and \u201980s with an extremist right-wing terrorist group, the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari, as well as with a notorious criminal gang active in Rome, the Banda della Magliana.But when it came to corruption, prosecutors charge, Mr. Carminati was above partisan politics \u2014 profiting from the left, right and center.The investigation has prompted the resignations of several politicians from various parties, including Rome\u2019s former right-wing mayor, Gianni Alemanno, who governed the city from 2008 to 2013, when the criminal organization flourished.Prosecutors claim that some of Mr. Alemanno\u2019s closest allies \u2014 some with old ties to the political extremism that marked the \u201cyears of lead\u201d of the 1970s and \u201980s \u2014 were full-fledged members of the criminal association. The former mayor denies any wrongdoing.After several party members were arrested, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi put the Rome faction of his Democratic Party under the emergency administration of the national president, Matteo Orfini, even as he pledged to toughen laws to fight corruption.On Wednesday, the police arrested 54 people in the central Umbria region, as part of an inquiry into the southern \u2019Ndrangheta crime syndicate, which investigators say had infiltrated the local economy.And the arrests there and in Rome fall on the heels of alleged political malfeasance in two important public works projects in Venice and Milan.Even to jaded observers, the scope of the scandal in Rome came as a surprise.\u201cCriminal affairs in Rome have existed since the times of the Caesars,\u201d said Giancarlo De Cataldo, a magistrate whose 2013 novel about corruption in the capital, \u201cSuburra,\u201d written with an investigative journalist, Carlo Bonini, has sold out in bookstores since the scandal erupted.Today\u2019s culprits are merely the heirs of ancient reprobates, he said, though the case proved that in some cases \u201creality far surpasses fiction,\u201d he added.The revelations relating to the immigrant emergency were particularly stinging. Among those arrested was also a top-ranking administrator who sat on the national board that oversees the immigrant emergency.\u201cThat\u2019s the incredible thing of this story \u2014 they transformed a national emergency into a business, relying on institutional references,\u201d said Claudio Gatti, a reporter who wrote about the immigration scheme for the economic daily Il Sole 24 Ore. \u201cIt\u2019s the system that underpins this country, cronyism.\u201dIn the wake of the allegations, inspectors have continued to comb Rome\u2019s City Council offices, scrutinizing public works contracts for possible Mafia infiltration. Nicola Zingaretti, the governor of Lazio, the region that includes Rome, halted the awarding of regional contracts and began an internal investigation.The current center-left mayor, Ignazio Marino, has emerged from the investigation unscathed and has pledged to root out the \u201crotten apples\u201d in a system that he says was otherwise healthy.Others counter that Rome is essentially an ungovernable city, providing fertile ground in which criminality thrives. To some, the scandal has also made clear to many Rome residents why the city seemed so shabby of late.\u201cThis Mafia infiltrated municipal agencies,\u201d putting loyal but inept people in top positions so they could \u201cdrain the coffers without providing services,\u201d said the investigative journalist Lirio Abbate, who wrote an expos\u00e9 about Mr. Carminati and other reputed Roman crime bosses for the newsmagazine L\u2019Espresso two years ago.\u201cThis has created huge damage to the collectivity, because the streets are full of holes and garbage, there\u2019s no maintenance to speak of, and the city has to increase taxes to stay afloat,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, the residents lose the most.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It hasn\u2019t moved in more than 60 years.The occupants are no longer the merchants who sold teak, oil and rice around the world, but lowly lawyers and petty traders who pay minimal rent \u2014 $20 a month for an office cubicle with no air-conditioning in sweltering heat \u2014 and a few families who live for free in dank rooms.Named the Balthazar Building after the well-to-do Armenian merchants who financed its construction at the turn of the 20th century, the edifice is one of hundreds that made this city, formerly Rangoon, a place of British ostentation in the tropics.Now the race is on to salvage banks flanked by Corinthian pillars, courthouses adorned with limestone lions, and shipping headquarters decorated with dark wood and brass fixtures before they collapse of decay.\u201cThe future is all about cities,\u201d said Mr. Thant Myint-U, who is trying to convince the government that the old has value and must be preserved. \u201cHaving a beautiful downtown will bring investment and give us an advantage over cities like Chennai and Kuala Lumpur.\u201d During the colonial period, Rangoon served as the capital of Burma. (The place names used by the British were retained until 1989 when the ruling junta changed the city to Yangon and the country to Myanmar.) The city had its own particular ethos. Students who had studied at Oxford and Cambridge made it the crucible of Burmese nationalism, reading Karl Marx and listening to jazz.In his 1934 novel, \u201cBurmese Days,\u201d George Orwell had his leading female character, the young husband-hunting Elizabeth Lackersteen, arrive by ship at the Rangoon docks, though Orwell refrained from describing the city, reserving his acidity about British rule for smaller towns in Burma.Not everyone admired the colonial cityscape as much as those who want to preserve it today. \u201cIt was built by a people who refused compromise with the East, and has wide, straight, shadeless streets, with much solid bank-architecture of vaguely Grecian inspiration,\u201d Norman Lewis, the British travel writer, said in his 1952 account of Burma, \u201cGolden Earth.\u201d \u201cThere is much facade and presence, little pretense at comfort and no surrender to the climate.\u201dThe Burmese economy was nationalized soon after World War II, and under the military government that took power in 1962 the buildings of the empire were allowed to rot. Economic sanctions by the West crippled the flow of supplies \u2014 oil, glass, fixtures \u2014 needed for maintenance.In 2005, the government moved to a new capital, Naypyidaw, leaving empty many buildings that had at least been occupied, if not maintained.Among the abandoned structures, the Secretariat, a vast Victorian-era complex arranged around lush gardens that had served as the heart of the government, fell on hard times. The red domed buildings now need an estimated $100 million in repairs.In November, Mr. Thant Myint-U showed President Obama, who visited Myanmar for an Asian summit, around the Secretariat. \u201cWe discussed the need for an overall vision and plan for the city,\u201d he said of the president\u2019s tour.The Yangon Heritage Trust has won some victories. The group objected to plans for a major new building of more than 20 stories in the historic downtown area. The government ruled in favor of the trust, and now there is an informal agreement that new structures downtown will not rise higher than six stories.But government works in strange ways in Myanmar: Many decisions are made on an ad hoc basis, and developers are looking for cheap insider deals as the economy goes through a rough transition. There is no legal framework for protection of the buildings, and no discussion of how to protect the people who have been living in hallways, towers and hidden back rooms.The trust hopes to change that with a master plan that would sort out legal ownership, designate renovation projects and deal with traffic and sanitation by the end of 2015, said Mr. Thant Myint-U, the grandson of the former United Nations secretary general, U Thant, and a historian who has written books on Myanmar.At the heart of the plan will be the idea that downtown Yangon should retain its vibrancy rather than become another sanitized zone that appeals to well-to-do tourists impressed by expensive hotels and tony cafes, Mr. Thant Myint-U said. To preserve a sense of authenticity, he said, there will be efforts to keep residents in some of the buildings, perhaps with subsidized rents, and to limit the number of big, impersonal international hotels that attract foreign visitors but are off-limits to most locals.The distinctive charm of the teetering colonial-era buildings lies in the street life around them: the bookstalls along Pansodan Street with paperbacks laid out on the sidewalk and vendors overseeing their wares from little plastic stools; the makeshift food booths selling small snakes in screw-top jars, watermelons the size of several footballs, bright orange papayas and emerald green limes.In the Balthazar Building, the decrepit lobby serves as the kitchen for Daw Than Hla, a 63-year-old widow.In the early evening, as the office workers head home, she lights a brazier in an alcove beside the elevator and tosses sliced onions in oil, the aromas adding a decidedly domestic touch to the crumbling marble and iron d\u00e9cor as she prepares dinner.\u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 40 years,\u201d she said, pointing to small rooms where her daughter, son and grandchild sleep. \u201cMy husband worked in the fisheries department and when he died they allowed me to stay.\u201dIn one of the cubicles on the third floor, Aung Ning Tun, a lawyer, said he would be reluctant to leave, even if offered modern office space elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s very hot in the building, and it badly needs renovation, but it is very convenient to the courts,\u201d he said.In the parts of the city outside the historic zone, the skyline has changed little, though life has become more hectic after decades of somnolence under the military dictatorship. Migrants from the countryside squeeze into crowded apartments; hundreds of thousands more cars, a product of the growing economy, create some of the worst gridlock in Southeast Asia. Some historic buildings have been demolished, including the grandiose 1895 government house resplendent with turrets and gables, and the house where the Chilean poet, Pablo Neruda, lived in the late 1920s.Mr. Neruda served briefly as his country\u2019s consul in Rangoon, an unpaid posting that left him poor but led to a passionate love affair with a Burmese muse he called Josie Bliss. He wrote a poem during his stay, \u201cRangoon 1927,\u201d that includes these lines: Supreme light that opened over my haira world at its zenith, it entered my eyesand ran through my veinsinto every corner of my body,until granting me the sovereigntyof an excessive, exiled love.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dollar-Wise Alternative for Expanding Families ", "Date": "2014-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the WheelAh, the minivan. That target of stand-up comedians and patronizing waves at shopping malls, even as it performs its thankless chores with versatility and forbearance. Kind of like parents. Still, I know parents who would rather ride on the back of a garbage truck than be seen driving a minivan. That dismissive stance inevitably turns into a distress call when families add a second, third or fourth child, procreating themselves into the minivan demographic. And when they realize that a large S.U.V. is less space-efficient than a minivan, some take the final plunge into self-sacrificing parenthood, holding their noses all the way down.Minivans may be down, but they\u2019re not out. Toyota has smartly revamped its Sienna for 2015. Honda hit a home run when it offered the Odyssey with a built-in, Cheerio-devouring HondaVac for easy cleanups. To wield the HondaVac, however, one must spend more than $45,000 on the top-dog Touring Elite version of the Odyssey. The Sienna, too, can shoot past $46,000 when fully optioned. That\u2019s a lot of money for a minivan, which brings us to the Kia Sedona. Better-looking than your average minivan, with outstanding features and ergonomics \u2014 and a 10-year, 100,000-mile warranty \u2014 the Sedona starts at $26,795, some $3,000 less than the most-affordable Odyssey, the LX. The Kia\u2019s main demerit is that it doesn\u2019t ride or handle as well as the Honda or Toyota. But the Sedona will still complete any family\u2019s to-do list while saving money for missions to Ikea. Unlike many minivans, which undertake styling advances cautiously, the 2015 Sedona proudly announces its redesign. A van that looked strip-mall generic is suddenly streamlined and appealing \u2014 or as streamlined as you\u2019re going to make a vehicle that\u2019s shaped like a shipping crate. If fashionistas can avoid snickering, I might venture that the Sedona is the best-looking of the current minivans, adopting the aggressive jut and contours of a modern crossover utility vehicle. A smartly creased hood is fronted by what Kia calls its tiger nose grille, a pet cue of the designer Peter Schreyer, president of the Hyundai Motor Group, who oversees Hyundai and Kia styling.The minivan\u2019s boxy shape limits styling freedom from the windshield back, but Kia does what it can. The doors are subtly scalloped, front and rear overhangs have been shortened and available 19-inch aluminum wheels nicely stuff the arches. The window frames between the second and third rows kick upward in Honda fashion. The appeal continues inside. A horizontal dashboard, with a central touch screen and ruler-straight row of large switches, is calming and uncluttered. Binocular-shaped binnacles house the driver\u2019s gauges, bisected by a sharp display for various vehicle functions controlled from the small-diameter steering wheel by a set of Audi-style thumbwheels. As in other new Kias and Hyundais, the big, crisp touch screen for navigation, audio, phone and apps is one of the industry\u2019s best, in part because operating it is child\u2019s play. In every way imaginable, Kia\u2019s controls whip the Honda\u2019s horror-show of awkward menus and a rotary control knob that can confound even simple tasks. Kia\u2019s latest UVO infotainment and telematics system adds parent-friendly phone-based apps and available e-features such as Pandora, Yelp, Google Local Search and Siri Eyes Free.2015 Kia Sedona. Keeping tabs on the children remains a minivan priority, and the Kia mostly scores. Unlike other minivans, Kia plunks a standard, S.U.V.-style front storage console between the front seats. There\u2019s the requisite cup holder overload \u2014 12 in this case \u2014 but some minivans offer a few more cubbies for family detritus. The Sedona comes in seven- or eight-passenger configurations, with either a three-position bench in the rear or a pair of captain\u2019s chairs. Compared with the previous Sedona, Kia lifted the hip point of the front seats to improve outward visibility. A 1.6-inch wheelbase stretch delivers a bit more legroom in all rows. That way-back row, split 60/40, smoothly pivots and tucks into the floor. For the second row, standard Slide-N-Stow seats pivot and fold against the front seat backs for more cargo space, but they can\u2019t be easily removed. For the top-level SX Limited, the conversation piece is the First Class lounge seating in the second row, which provides flip-up legrests and a extending footrest like the top-shelf Sienna. Borrowing a trick from airliners, their winged headrests swivel to cradle the passenger\u2019s neck. Those chairs slide well fore-and-aft. They also slide inboard to help parents reach child seats or outboard to open a gap where third-row riders can take advantage of extra legroom.My 8-year-old daughter, who can be blas\u00e9 about $100,000 cars, loved the lounge seats. \u201cDaddy, keep this car, buy this car,\u201d she implored, stretching her boots to the limit like a chief executive in training.Seats in all three rows of the SXL (as the van\u2019s tailgate badge reads) are wrapped in soft Nappa leather, and the dual sunroofs open electrically, in contrast with the fixed rear panels in many vehicles. For other trim levels, Kia offers a new upholstery fabric with antimicrobial and antistatic properties, along with the ability to repel and release stains. The new-generation Sedona feels solid and quiet, with generous sound deadening throughout and a chassis that, according to Kia, has 36 percent greater torsional stiffness than its closest segment competitor. Ultra-high-strength steel tubes inside the front roof pillars bolster the Sedona\u2019s roof-crush safety. An available power liftgate opens automatically after three seconds when a driver approaching with the key fob is sensed. With 276 horsepower and 248 pound-feet of torque, the 3.3-liter V6 is a bit more potent than the 3.5-liter it replaces. It\u2019s also smoother and quieter, and this V6 is a high point in the engine portfolio of Kia and Hyundai. Acceleration is solid, though the 6-speed automatic transmission sometimes hesitates to downshift. Fuel economy remains this engine\u2019s handicap. When hauling the 4,650 pounds of the SXL, the V6 is rated at 17 m.p.g. in town and 22 on the highway. Sedonas with fewer features go as high as 18/25 m.p.g., roughly on par with Toyota and Chrysler vans but short of the Honda\u2019s 19/28 m.p.g. The Sedona\u2019s larger issue is its roly-poly handling. When I handed off driving to a colleague and tucked into the third row, the gyrations of the pillowy, pitching ride approached moonwalk proportions. Whether children will complain is an open question \u2014 most children can\u2019t get enough of moonwalks \u2014 but moms and dads who want a more precise, buttoned-down hauler may prefer the Odyssey.Beyond its $40,595 base price, the SXL that I tested had a $2,700 Technology Package with adaptive cruise control, forward-collision and lane-departure warnings, a surround-view monitor and xenon headlamps. The total came to $43,295; a rear-seat entertainment system is $995 more.Like most new Kias, this handsome, smartly equipped Sedona gets a lot right. Yet the Sedona also shows that driving dynamics can be a weak spot for the brand. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Kia ends up sending the Sedona to finishing school, in the form of a suspension recalibration, for a 2016 or 2017 model. If that is done, the Sedona will have a shot at joining the minivan elite.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Narrowly Passes Bill to Avoid Shutdown; $1.1 Trillion in Spending ", "Date": "2014-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House narrowly passed a $1.1 trillion spending package on Thursday that would fund most government operations for the fiscal year after a rancorous debate that reflected the new power held by Republicans and the disarray among Democrats in the aftermath of the midterm elections.The split in the Democratic Party dramatically burst into view when Representative Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader and one of President Obama\u2019s most loyal supporters, broke with the administration over a provision in the bill that would roll back regulation of the Dodd-Frank Act, which Ms. Pelosi said was a giveaway to big banks whose practices helped fuel the Great Recession. She spoke on the House floor in the early afternoon, expressing her strong opposition to the bill.Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were pressed to make a furious round of phone calls to try to persuade wavering Democrats, while House Speaker John A. Boehner worked to get more Republican votes.The public support of the sweeping spending bill by the White House \u2014 which came just as Ms. Pelosi was making her speech on the House floor opposing it \u2014 was a rare public break with the minority leader and infuriated many of her loyalists.In a more than three-hour, closed-door meeting of House Democrats on Thursday night, many of the party\u2019s more liberal members tried to rally support against the bill. The moment, they said, was one of conscience, and a chance for Democrats to demonstrate their allegiance with the middle class.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stand up for principle at some point, or they\u2019re going to kick us even more next year when they have a bigger majority,\u201d said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon. \u201cThey know we will stand our ground on principle in the future and not roll us so easily again.\u201dIn an emergency gathering, Democrats also expressed anger at Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, at what they saw as the president\u2019s undercutting of Ms. Pelosi and other progressives by coming out in support of the deal so early in the day. But Ms. Pelosi ultimately gave her members the freedom to vote how they wanted. \u201cI\u2019m giving you the leverage to do what you have to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have enough votes to show them never to do this again.\u201dThe final vote was a blow to Ms. Pelosi, the liberal wing of the party and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who led the charge against the Dodd-Frank rollback. Mr. Boehner built a coalition of 162 Republicans and 57 Democrats, a rare achievement for a Congress that has often operated along strict party lines. Congress also passed a two-day funding measure to give the Senate time to pass the legislation.With an opportunity to return to a more conventional legislative process \u2014 funding the government for a fiscal year rather than for months at a time \u2014 Republican leaders had thought they had sufficient bipartisan support to pass the bill. The adopted measure funds the government through Sept. 30, 2015.But an early sign of the headwinds facing the legislation came around noon, when the deal barely cleared a procedural hurdle to allow a vote. In several tense minutes on the House floor, support to move forward on the package seesawed, with Democrats shouting \u201cCall the vote\u201d and Republicans holding it open until they were able to persuade two lawmakers to switch their votes.House Democrats \u2014 who were already trying to strike a delicate balance \u2014 found their calculation complicated by the White House, which released a pre-emptive signal that Mr. Obama would sign the bipartisan legislation if it made it out of Congress.Postponing action on the spending bill until next year would not have been good for either party. Republicans were eager to get the package behind them so they could start 2015 with a fresh agenda. And although Democrats found some provisions of the spending bill objectionable \u2014 including a measure that would significantly increase the limits on individual contributions to political parties \u2014 the package was negotiated on a bipartisan basis and they probably would have been forced into greater concessions next year.Not everyone on the right was happy with the deal, either. Some House Republicans thought that Mr. Boehner did not go far enough in fighting Mr. Obama over his executive action last month to defer the deportation of as many as five million unauthorized immigrants. The spending deal funds the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 the agency primarily assigned to carry out the president\u2019s immigration policy \u2014 only through February, at which point Republicans will control both chambers of Congress and have the leverage to try to curtail Mr. Obama\u2019s action.But some conservatives wanted to immediately defund the Homeland Security agency, despite the risk of a partial government shutdown. After the bill was passed, Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana and majority whip, said that the vote \u201cset the stage for a battle with the president\u201d over his immigration action.For Mr. Boehner and Ms. Pelosi, the lead-up to Thursday\u2019s vote also demonstrated the strengths and limitations of their conferences.Mr. Boehner displayed a willingness to buck his party\u2019s more conservative members \u2014 as well as vocal outside groups \u2014 by passing the bill with the help of Democratic votes.\u201cThis bill is a one-two punch at middle-class voters,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, a member of the Democratic leadership. \u201cIt weakens financial regulation on big banks and rewards Congress for doing so by increasing donation limits of big donors. This is exactly why middle-class voters have a contempt of Congress.\u201dRepresentative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, supported much of the bill but criticized the increase in limits on contributions to political parties. She linked that provision to efforts by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and Mr. Boehner.\u201cThe Reid-Boehner provision to increase by tenfold the limits on contributions to political parties is excessive and also does not belong on this bill,\u201d Ms. Lowey said on the House floor.But Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said the campaign finance change had been negotiated with Senate Democrats.\u201cDemocrats in the Senate consented to it and, I suspect, participated in it,\u201d Mr. Cole said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Fears May Push Russia Into Ukraine Deal ", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Putin may make his intentions clearer at his annual news conference on Thursday. European leaders will meet later Thursday and Friday in Brussels amid growing indications that pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainians could meet Sunday or Monday for talks under European auspices.While leaving the United States at risk of becoming out of step with Europe, which is not seeking tighter sanctions, the new legislation could also help pressure Mr. Putin to seal a deal on Ukraine now that would relieve some of the pressure on the Russian economy.On Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that sanctions \u201ccould be lifted in a matter of weeks or days\u201d depending on how Mr. Putin acts.In Moscow, some analysts said the Kremlin appeared to have started moving toward a more flexible position on Ukraine before the ruble\u2019s nose dive, but the currency crisis of the past few days made progress imperative.\u201cIt seems like the new economic situation will inevitably force Russia to focus on the domestic crisis,\u201d said Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor of the journal Russia in Global Affairs.At the same time, Mr. Lukyanov said, Mr. Putin is unlikely to abandon the separatists in eastern Ukraine.\u201cPutin\u2019s credibility might be seriously damaged by this economic crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cIf in reaction he begins to clearly give up on Ukraine, that will be detrimental to his position, and he cannot afford it.\u201dFor some days, Russia experts in financial markets have suggested that Mr. Putin might agree to measures that would essentially freeze the conflict in eastern Ukraine, allowing aid into the region and halting hostilities, at least for the winter. That arrangement would still allow Mr. Putin to claim he was preventing Ukraine from any further move toward the European Union or NATO membership, said Christopher Granville, a Russia expert and managing director of Trusted Sources, an emerging markets research firm in London.There is a gap between what Europe and Germany, its No. 1 economy, might want, and voices in Congress in Washington who \u201cbehold with satisfaction Putin going down in flames,\u201d Mr. Granville said.Europeans have to share a continent with Russia and fear turmoil in the East, he added, noting that severe upheaval in Russia could also \u201cgreatly increase the probability of a terminal meltdown in Ukraine\u201d and could be counterproductive for Western supporters of the Ukrainian government in Kiev.Ukraine\u2019s currency has also plunged, and the country began an urgent appeal for more funds last week in Brussels.Complicating the picture is whether pro-Russian separatists would attend cease-fire talks and whether Mr. Putin would deliver on any promises made there.Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s new foreign affairs chief, reported \u201csome limited hope\u201d for a settlement to the conflict in eastern Ukraine based on a repeatedly violated truce agreement reached in September by pro-Russian separatists, Russia and Ukraine in the Belarus capital, Minsk.\u201cWe have gone through this too many times to fall into illusions about turning points,\u201d she said at a news conference on Monday. \u201cI would not define any turning point at the moment, but still, there is a small reason for hope on which we can build.\u201dOn a visit to Kiev on Tuesday, Ms. Mogherini pledged full European support for a new Ukrainian government and said the European Union would \u201cstand firmly at your side to make sure the Minsk protocol is implemented firmly in all parts.\u201dMichael Thumann, a senior foreign correspondent and Russia expert for the German weekly Die Zeit, said he was skeptical about the prospects for a lasting agreement, given Mr. Putin\u2019s need to appeal to different domestic constituencies at home and his behavior in the past year.\u201cPutin could try to solve economic problems with a new heroic, patriotic deed,\u201d Mr. Thumann said. \u201cI am not completely pessimistic, but at the moment, I just don\u2019t believe in the durability of his actions.\u201dThis kind of instability, he said, is anathema to German business. \u201cGerman business is looking at this with great concern,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all means nothing good for the Russian market in the near future.\u201d\u201cA destabilization of Russia is in nobody\u2019s interest,\u201d said Eckhard Cordes, chairman of the Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, a group traditionally pro-business with the Kremlin. \u201cThis would also have an impact on us.\u201dOn Wednesday, spokesmen for the German government were careful not to link the turmoil in Russia to the sanctions over Ukraine.\u201cThe crisis over the Russian currency and economics has various causes \u2014 not even primarily the sanctions,\u201d said Steffen Seibert, a German government spokesman.Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow, Andrew Higgins from Brussels and Victor Homola from Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China G.D.P. Is Revised 3.4% Higher For Last Year ", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe revision added more than $300 billion to the size of what was already the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States. But in making the announcement, the Chinese government also said that the new way the figures were calculated would not affect the current growth rate, which has been close to 7.4 percent for much of this year, near the government\u2019s target.The National Bureau of Statistics said the revision to G.D.P. was mainly because of better measurement of the size of the service sector after a recent economic census. The changes announced on Friday were much smaller than earlier revisions of nearly 17 percent higher following the 2004 economic census and an increase of 4.4 percent after the 2008 census.The revisions are part of China\u2019s effort to raise the quality of its government reporting standards after years of skepticism about the veracity of some of the economic numbers it reports.Some analysts were expecting a much larger revision to G.D.P. this week. The Rhodium Group, a New York-based advisory firm with expertise on China, had forecast an upward revision closer to 10 percent. But Daniel Rosen and Beibei Bao, analysts at Rhodium, said that the Chinese authorities had probably not yet made certain changes to the methodology used to measure the size of the economy.The size of the United States economy was about $16.7 trillion in 2013, significantly larger than China\u2019s, when measured in nominal G.D.P. But this year, the International Monetary Fund said that by purchasing power parity, a less widely accepted measure of G.D.P. that uses exchange rates to adjust for the prices of selected common goods, China\u2019s economy is nearly the same size as that of the United States. On the purchasing power basis, the I.M.F. forecasts the American economy at $17.6 trillion this year, while China\u2019s is estimated at $17.4 trillion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Race to Build on River Could Block Pacific Oil Route ", "Date": "2014-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVANCOUVER, Wash. \u2014 Environmental passions, which run hot in the Northwest over everything from salmon to recycling, generally get couched in the negative: Don\u2019t fish too much, don\u2019t put those chemicals up the smokestack, don\u2019t build in that sensitive area.But here in southern Washington, some environmental groups are quietly pushing a builder to move even faster with a $1.3 billion real estate project along the Columbia River that includes office buildings, shops and towers with 3,300 apartments.The result is a sort of race to the crossing: If the Waterfront can get its bricks and mortar in the ground before the terminal is approved \u2014 possibly late next year, with litigation likely to follow \u2014 more people would be living and working near the oil-train line. Compounding what opponents, led by the city, say are the dangers of spills or derailments, would make the terminal\u2019s path to approval steeper.The surge of fossil fuels delivered by rail that is wending its way across many corners of America is hitting the Pacific Northwest \u2014 the closest straight line from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean \u2014 with a fury, and a complex new calculation of strategy for both sides.Vancouver\u2019s dueling projects \u2014 with the city government caught in the middle, opposing the oil project at its own port and backing the Waterfront project \u2014 crystallize the terms and stakes of the energy wave in one place, people on both sides of the issue said.Supporters of the oil terminal said opponents had the issues completely backward. Rising on a former industrial site, the Waterfront, they said, hopes to charge rents far beyond the historic market levels in a city that has long suffered in the shadow of glossier, hipper Portland, Ore., just across the river. But without the jobs and bolstered activity at the Port of Vancouver, terminal officials said, the city\u2019s grand urban dreams might not be feasible.Vancouver, with 167,000 residents, has prospered, but has often struggled, as a kind of kid-brother city to Portland, with many commuters living on this side of the river because Washington has no state income tax.The oil terminal would create 320 construction jobs, and 176 permanent operations jobs on the site, and inject $2 billion into the local and regional economy over 15 years according to Vancouver Energy. Vancouver Energy, the oil terminal\u2019s developer, is a joint project of the Tesoro Corporation, an oil refining and marketing company, and Savage Companies, a transportation solutions specialist. Both sides have a rich history to support their case. The burly old economic world of seagoing trade is still part of the muscle memory and economic life at Northwest port cities like Portland and Seattle. Vancouver is one of the nation\u2019s largest hubs for wheat, corn and soybeans heading out from farms in the northern plains, and for Subaru automobiles arriving for sale in West Coast showrooms.\u201cIt is Washington\u2019s destiny to lead,\u201d Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said at a news conference in Seattle. \u201cWe do not want to be addicted to gasoline anymore.\u201dBut in the new energy scramble of transport, all the pieces are in motion. North Dakota, responding to concerns from communities on rail lines, this month ordered oil shippers, starting April 1, to filter the volatile gases out of Bakken crude oil before shipment. BNSF Railway, which dominates freight shipments across the nation\u2019s northern tier, said it had lowered speeds for oil trains in populous areas and was spending billions of dollars on safety upgrades.The executive director of the Port of Vancouver, Todd Coleman, said more oil by rail is bound for West Coast refineries or other ports whether the terminal in Vancouver is built or not. And that in itself, he said, is a major argument for the project\u2019s approval. Having a terminal would give the city leverage, he said, to demand more in safety rules than it otherwise could.\u201cIt is leverage because it is an important project to the railroads, but also just the increased awareness,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cThis makes an issue we can work together on to make it a better system overall.\u201dMr. Inslee said in an interview that in the next legislative session he planned to introduce a package of proposals aimed at improving rail safety in communities exposed to oil traffic. He declined to comment on the Vancouver terminal project, which would reach his desk for final approval under the state\u2019s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council process, except to say public safety is his first priority.The Vancouver city manager, Eric J. Holmes, said every advance at the Waterfront potentially changed the final arguments on the terminal, which he thinks could be years away, perhaps ending up before the State Supreme Court.If the city itself changes in the meantime, he said, those final arguments about oil and rail and safety will change, too. \u201cIf it adds to the argument about our community\u2019s safety, we\u2019ll certainly invoke it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crash of AirAsia Flight 8501 Spotlights Indonesia\u2019s Poor Air Safety Record", "Date": "2014-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe audit reinforced the fact that Indonesia, which scored far worse than impoverished neighbors such as Laos and Myanmar, has a chronic problem with aviation safety.Although in recent years there were glimmers of hope that aviation safety might be improving, the crash of AirAsia Flight 8501 into the Java Sea on Sunday has renewed concerns that Indonesia cannot keep up with the ever-growing popularity of air travel as incomes rise and low-cost carriers multiply.What role, if any, the failings of Indonesia\u2019s aviation system may have played in the crash of Flight 8501 may not be known for weeks. But in a country of 17,000 islands, where cheap flights are replacing the ferry journeys that Indonesians used to take across the archipelago, the chances of dying on an Indonesian plane, while rare, are unacceptably high, experts say.Arnold Barnett, a statistician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in airline safety, said that the death rate in airplane crashes over the past decade in Indonesia was one per million passengers who boarded. That rate is 25 times the rate in the United States.\u201cTo assert that the disparity is only a coincidence or manifestation of bad luck would be preposterous,\u201d Mr. Barnett said.Investigators looking into Flight 8501, which went down with 162 people on board, will zero in on the crucial minutes after\u00a06:12 a.m. Sunday, when the pilot asked for permission to change course to avoid stormy weather. Soon after, contact was lost with the Airbus A320.By Wednesday night, with recovery teams fighting turbulent weather and rocky seas, only seven bodies had been recovered, four men and three women. Contrary to some news reports, there were no confirmed sightings of the plane\u2019s fuselage, much less the flight data recorder.What is known so far about the ill-fated flight offers only vague clues to why it plunged into the sea. Flying in stormy conditions around 40 minutes after takeoff from Surabaya, Indonesia\u2019s second-largest city, on a quick hop to Singapore, the pilot requested permission to change course.Ground controllers granted the request to veer left but denied the request to ascend to a higher altitude, which was reserved for another AirAsia aircraft.Maps of the flight path, air traffic near the plane when it disappeared and where debris was found.Then nothing. The aircraft sent no distress signal. The fact that bodies were discovered intact in the sea has led to speculation that the aircraft may have hit the water in one piece.The uncertainty over what happened to their loved ones has weighed heavily on family members waiting for news in an overcrowded room at the Surabaya airport. When the first bodies appeared off the coast of Borneo on Tuesday afternoon, two and a half days after the plane disappeared, parents, spouses and other relatives wailed in grief. Lince Gonimasala, 39, fainted into the arms of Surabaya\u2019s mayor. Her 13-year-old son, Adrian Fernando, had been on the plane, as well as her brother and sister-in-law, and their 4-year-old son.\u201cI\u2019m still hoping,\u201d Ms. Gonimasala said Wednesday.Adrian\u2019s grandfather, John Gonimasala, 70, a retired general goods trader from the Moluccan islands, held open his palms. \u201cDisasters are God\u2019s will,\u201d he said. \u201cI know they\u2019re gone.\u201dLike most of the passengers, the Gonimasalas were members of Indonesia\u2019s emerging middle class, en route to Singapore for post-Christmas and New Year\u2019s celebrations.Many were among the first generation in their family who could afford such a luxury, avatars of a demographic shift that has produced an airline boom in Indonesia. With a population of 250 million people, Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing markets for commercial jets, with more than 600 planes on order.Yet Indonesia has long ranked at or near the top of every list of developing countries with an aviation safety problem. It has a reputation for weak airline safety practices, a shortage of experienced pilots, lots of mountains presenting hazards for low-flying planes, and rapidly rising air travel as the economy booms.It is one of nine countries currently listed as failing a safety assessment by the United States Federal Aviation Administration. (The other countries are Bangladesh, Barbados, Cura\u00e7ao, Ghana, India, Nicaragua, Saint Martin and Uruguay.)One symbol of its dismal aviation record is a mountain near Jakarta that has been the site of a half-dozen fatal crashes by planes large and small over the past dozen years.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Indonesia has a particular challenge, because it\u2019s trying to make up ground, it\u2019s growing faster and there\u2019s a well-known problem of pilots being poached to work elsewhere,\u201d said Martin Craigs, the chairman of the Aerospace Forum Asia, a nonprofit industry group based in Hong Kong.Insurance companies charge Indonesian airlines nearly double the global average for premiums per passenger because of their poor safety history. Airlines in only a handful of countries in Africa and Latin America pay more, while most other Asian carriers pay considerably less.The European Union currently bars 62 Indonesian carriers from flying to Europe for safety reasons. That used to include the Indonesian subsidiary of AirAsia, but the European Union has cleared Garuda, Indonesia AirAsia and a few other carriers over the last several years as they have worked to improve safety.AirAsia, which has a strong safety record, owns 49 percent of its Indonesian affiliate. Because Indonesia bars airlines with majority foreign ownership from operating domestic routes, AirAsia entered the market by acquiring a stake in a small Indonesian carrier, Awair, then changed the name, replaced senior management and bankrolled rapid expansion.Peter Marosszeky, a senior aviation research fellow at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said that it was too early to conclude that the AirAsia crash was the result of a mistake by either the Indonesian authorities or the Indonesian pilot of the lost plane. The aircraft went down in a powerful storm, and many factors could have been involved, he cautioned.With an economy that has been steadily growing nearly 6 percent a year, Indonesia is investing heavily to improve and expand its airports and provide them with the latest equipment. Surabaya is one of the country\u2019s largest and most modern airports.Experts say even if it builds state-of-the-art aviation facilities, Indonesia will have trouble keeping up with demand for pilots.Pilot shortages are especially acute in developing countries, as affluent carriers in industrialized countries tend to hire away the most experienced, best trained pilots around the world.Many experts remain skeptical of Indonesia\u2019s prospects to improve safety quickly.The Indonesian agency responsible for regulating airlines, a division of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, \u201cis understaffed, not terribly well run and under-resourced,\u201d said Roger Mulberge, a former commercial pilot and aviation safety consultant based in Bangkok. \u201cThey\u2019re doing their best, but they\u2019re trying to make bricks without straw.\u201dOn Wednesday night, the first two bodies were flown back to Surabaya. The families of the other 160 people aboard the flight are still waiting.\u201cThe most hurtful is the uncertainty,\u201d said the Rev. Agustinus Tri Budi Utomo, a Catholic priest who was waiting at the airport with many of his parishioners. \u201cThey are hoping, they\u2019re waiting for a miracle.\u201dThomas Fuller reported from Jakarta, and Keith Bradsher from Sydney, Australia. Reporting was contributed by Tom McCawley from Surabaya, Indonesia; Austin Ramzy from Hong Kong; Nicola Clark from Paris; and Poypiti Amatatham from Bangkok.Advertisement"}

I dissipated part of my youth here in a trance of happiness and, even at this distance, I find that happiness accessible. As we grow older memory gains in importance, a labyrinth of infinite possibility.So much of life today is jolting that a measure of dilatory inefficiency becomes comforting. The transactional relationships of London or New York or Singapore give way to the human relationship of Rome. People actually take a few seconds to look at each other. They chat without purpose.The heavy hotel room key (rather than anonymous key card); the perfect carciofi alla Romana (little artichokes Roman style) dissolving in the mouth; the unchanging answer to any man-in-the-street question about the state of the Italian Republic (\u201cfa schifo\u201d \u2013 it stinks); the \u201cmanifestazione,\u201d or demonstration, that closes a wide area of central Rome; the style of the \u201cbarista\u201d making three espressos, two lattes and two cappuccinos at once (eat your heart out, plodding Starbucks); the focus of the ma\u00eetre grating truffles with the clinical majesty of a matador; the grumbling and the small courtesies; the sound of voices rather than engines; the high-ceilinged apartments in their cool half-light; the whining scooters on the banks of the muddy Tiber; the shutters clattering down on stores at lunch time, only to reopen in the late afternoon. All of this consoles in its familiarity.Rush on world, the voice of Rome seems to murmur: ambition will founder, conquest will unravel, riches will be lost, power will be dissipated, palaces will crumble, great loves will end, borders will be redrawn; and you, shed at last of your illusions, will be left to find comfort in beauty, family, your corner of the city, and a steaming plate of bucatini all\u2019amatriciana.It was Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa who observed that everything must change so that everything stays the same. Here it sometimes seems that everything must stay the same so that one or two things may change (the city clocks, unlike when I lived here 30 years ago, now tend to function).Then, of course, there is politics. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, aged 39, is a revolutionary politician in that his youth, direct language, dynamism and relative transparency have shaken up old habits. There is something of the young Tony Blair about him. He is a showman pushing change through force of character. His ambition for Italy, he has said, \u201cis not to do better than Greece but to do better than Germany.\u201dThat, by Italian standards, would be big. Renzi\u2019s slogan, in effect, is change or die. Unemployment is over 13 percent, public debt continues to climb, and Italy has known three recessions in six years. The country is problematic. Still, caution with official numbers is advisable. Family solidarity, private wealth and the black economy cushion the crisis the statistics declare. Italy is poor; Italians are richer than it.Like almost all Europeans, they are being outpaced by the hunger for wealth, long working days and unregulated economies of the emergent world, where most people scarcely know what social security means. Still, Italians contrive to live better than seems possible in a declining economy.There is nothing that unusual for a Roman about going home for lunch (or even having \u201cla Mamma\u201d prepare it). Resistance to change can also be healthy. It is a buffer against dislocation and loneliness, preserving the ties of family and sociability. Cultural skepticism about change runs deep. Unlike Americans, Italians have no desire to reinvent themselves. Rome restrains the itch to believe all can be changed utterly. Style is its refuge.Italy needs change; Renzi is right to push for it. New investment will only come when the bureaucratic rigidities that curtail the economy are overcome. But change will always have its limits here. Behind Italian frivolity lies a deep-seated prudence.The past year has been sobering. A quarter-century on from the fall of the Berlin Wall we see how deluded we were to imagine, even for a moment, that the old battles of nation-states and rival ideologies would give way to a world driven by enlightened self-interest and the shared embrace of Western liberal democracy and the rule of law.Al Qaeda, Vladimir Putin and the Chinese Communist Party thought otherwise. Powers still do what they do: seek to further their interests, accumulate resources and advance their ideologies, at the expense of others if necessary. Beheadings and plague have not been banished from the world.Italians tend to shrug. They knew this all along. There are compelling reasons to prefer beauty to the squalid affairs of the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Putin\u2019s Global Courtships ", "Date": "2014-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThere was a time when President Vladimir Putin was welcomed, even courted, by governments in the West. Now, as tensions between them grow over the issue of Ukraine, and as Russia\u2019s economy is under stress, Mr. Putin is pursuing new friends, including one of the world\u2019s most noxious leaders, Kim Jong-un of North Korea.During the Cold War, the Soviet Union often helped prop up North Korea\u2019s brutal totalitarian regime. This year, after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea led to a crisis and the imposition of sanctions by the United States and Europe, Mr. Putin has moved to strengthen those ties as part of a \u201cLook East\u201d policy designed to compensate for the loss of economic and political interaction with the West. Russia is interested in North Korea\u2019s mineral resources and needs its help in building a gas pipeline through North Korea to reach the wealthier South Korea. Meanwhile, North Korea sees Russia as a way to reduce dependency on China, its main source of food and fuel. Mr. Kim is also seeking help to block a United Nations Security Council resolution that would refer Pyongyang to the International Criminal Court for its human rights abuses.But with its basket-case economy and unpredictable leaders, North Korea is a difficult friend, and just how far Mr. Putin could take the relationship is unclear. It\u2019s one thing if he exploits North Korea for economic purposes. It\u2019s quite another if his quest for collaborators makes him unwilling to work with the West in pressing North Korea to end its nuclear program; so far, that is not the case.For decades, people speculated about some kind of China-Russia alliance, but one never really materialized. The gas deal is viewed in Washington as much more favorable to Beijing than to Moscow, and over the long term, China\u2019s economic and political strengths seem certain to ensure that Russia will always be the junior partner \u2014 a position that is unlikely to please Mr. Putin.Mr. Putin is also seeking closer ties with Turkey \u2014 a NATO ally that aspires to membership in the European Union \u2014 in part to dilute the effect of sanctions. To that end he is also trying to persuade Serbia and Bosnia that integration with the West is not their only option and that close ties with Russia could yield them big returns. He is unlikely to have much success portraying Russia as the more reliable friend, especially since the United States, again the engine of global growth, and Europe offer more attractive economic and political visions. But as Ukraine proves, he can be skillful at causing problems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Optimism Faces Grave Realities at Climate Talks", "Date": "2014-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After more than two decades of trying but failing to forge a global pact to halt climate change, United Nations negotiators gathering in South America this week are expressing a new optimism that they may finally achieve the elusive deal.Even with a deal to stop the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions, scientists warn, the world will become increasingly unpleasant. Without a deal, they say, the world could eventually become uninhabitable for humans.For the next two weeks, thousands of diplomats from around the globe will gather in Lima, Peru, for a United Nations summit meeting to draft an agreement intended to stop the global rise of planet-warming greenhouse gases.But while scientists and climate-policy experts welcome the new momentum ahead of the Lima talks, they warn that it now may be impossible to prevent the temperature of the planet\u2019s atmosphere from rising by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. According to a large body of scientific research, that is the tipping point at which the world will be locked into a near-term future of drought, food and water shortages, melting ice sheets, shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels and widespread flooding \u2014 events that could harm the world\u2019s population and economy.Recent reports show that there may be no way to prevent the planet\u2019s temperature from rising, given the current level of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere and the projected rate of emissions expected to continue before any new deal is carried out.That fact is driving the urgency of the Lima talks, which are expected to produce a draft document, to be made final over the next year and signed by world leaders in Paris in December 2015.While a breach of the 3.6 degree threshold appears inevitable, scientists say that United Nations negotiators should not give up on their efforts to cut emissions. At stake now, they say, is the difference between a newly unpleasant world and an uninhabitable one.\u201cI was encouraged by the U.S.-China agreement,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University and a member of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a global body of scientists that produces regular reports on the state of climate science. But he expressed doubts that the threshold rise in global temperature could be prevented.\u201cWhat\u2019s already baked in are substantial changes to ecosystems, large-scale transformations,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer said. He cited losses of coral reef systems and ice sheets, and lowering crop yields.Still, absent a deal, \u201cThings could get a lot worse,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer added. Beyond the 3.6 degree threshold, he said, the aggregate cost \u201cto the global economy \u2014 rich countries as well as poor countries \u2014 rises rapidly.\u201dThe objective now, negotiators say, is to stave off atmospheric temperature increases of 4 to 10 degrees by the end of the century; at that point, they say, the planet could become increasingly uninhabitable.Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are already reporting that 2014 appears likely to be the warmest year on record.Since 1992, the United Nations has convened an annual climate change summit meeting aimed at forging a deal to curb greenhouse gases, which are produced chiefly by burning coal for electricity and gasoline for transportation. But previous agreements, such as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, included no requirements that developing nations, such as India and China, cut their emissions. And until now, the United States has never headed into those summit meetings with a domestic climate change policy in place.This spring, a report by 13 federal agencies concluded that climate change would harm the American economy by increasing food prices, insurance rates and financial volatility. In China, the central government has sought to quell citizen protests related to coal pollution.\u201cOur sense is that this will resonate in the broader climate community, give momentum to the negotiations and spur countries to come forward with their own targets,\u201d said Todd Stern, Mr. Obama\u2019s lead climate change negotiator. \u201cThe two historic antagonists, the biggest players, announcing they\u2019ll work together.\u201dOther negotiators agree. \u201cThe prospects are so much better than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d said Felipe Calder\u00f3n, the former president of Mexico and chairman of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, a research organization.The aim of negotiators in Lima is, for the first time, to produce an agreement in which every nation commits to a domestic plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, along the model of the United States-China agreement. Negotiators expect that by next March, governments will make announcements similar to those made by the United States and China.The idea is for each country to cut emissions at a level that it can realistically achieve, but in keeping with domestic political and economic constraints. World leaders would sign a deal in Paris next year committing all those nations to their cuts, including a provision that the nations regularly reconvene to further reduce their emissions.Some areas of the globe are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and inhabitants are being forced to make stark changes in their lives.The problem is that climate experts say it almost certainly will not happen fast enough. A November report by the United Nations Environment Program concluded that in order to avoid the 3.6 degree increase, global emissions must peak within the next 10 years, going down to half of current levels by midcentury.But the deal being drafted in Lima will not even be enacted until 2020. And the structure of the emerging deal \u2014 allowing each country to commit to what it can realistically achieve, given each nation\u2019s domestic politics \u2014 means that the initial cuts by countries will not be as stringent as what scientists say is required.China\u2019s plan calls for its emissions to peak in 2030. Government officials in India, the world\u2019s third-largest carbon polluter, have said they do not expect to see their emissions decline until at least 2040. While Mr. Obama has committed to United Nations emissions cuts through 2025, there is no way to know if his successor will continue on that path.That reality is already setting in among low-lying island nations, like the Marshall Islands, where rising seas are soaking coastal soil, killing crops and contaminating fresh water supplies.\u201cThe groundwater that supports our food crops is becoming inundated with salt,\u201d said Tony A. deBrum, foreign minister of the Marshall Islands. \u201cThe green is becoming brown.\u201dMany island nations are looking into buying farmland in other countries to grow food and, eventually, to relocate their populations.In Lima, those countries are expected to demand that a final deal include aid to help them adapt to the climate impacts that have already arrived.Advertisement"}

Putin grew wildly popular by making Russians richer every year and by vowing to restore their country\u2019s great power status. But now, with the government predicting Tuesday that the battered economy will fall into recession next year, that formula is in jeopardy.Every day brings a barrage of woeful economic news. World oil prices just hit a five-year low. The Russian ruble is down 40 percent against the dollar so far in 2014. Inflation is due to rise 9 percent this year and to continue climbing. Capital flight is expected to reach $128 billion.The Kremlin suffered the collapse of the Soviet state and a government default during previous extended declines in oil prices, so the changing fortunes potentially pose extreme challenges. Experts underscore, however, that the country is far more resilient now than in the 1980s or in 1998, the previous times of crisis, particularly its stout private sector.Mr. Putin has already shelved planned megaprojects, like the South Stream pipeline to ship gas to southern Europe, which was canceled on Monday, and a high-speed railway from Moscow to Kazan, a city east of the capital.Some analysts say the changes may be felt in the policy area, where Mr. Putin may feel compelled to tone down his aggressive, anti-Western stance. But others worry that he may do just the opposite, saying that his need to divert attention from economic problems might inspire further nationalistic adventures abroad, akin to the annexation of Crimea.\u201cIt is a completely new reality for him,\u201d Sergei M. Guriev, a prominent economist who fled into exile last year, said of Mr. Putin. \u201cWhenever Russia wanted the oil price to go up, it has gone up. He has always been lucky, and this time he is not lucky.\u201dRussia is heavily dependent on oil, which constitutes some 60 percent of its exports. With the collapse in prices coinciding with severe economic turbulence caused by Western sanctions over destabilizing Ukraine, Mr. Putin risks losing the engine that was supposed to power Russia back onto the world stage.Financial experts say Russia\u2019s most pressing problem is not the sinking ruble, despite its potential to prompt a run on the banks, nor the falling price of oil, though the annual budget was based on a price of $96 per barrel, which is now hovering around $70.\u201cThis is all peanuts compared to the financing crisis,\u201d said Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister turned opposition politician.Nearly $700 billion is owed to Western banks, economists said, much of it by the giant state-run companies that constitute the heart of the Russian economy. But sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and adventurism in southeastern Ukraine have blocked access to Western financing.Despite Moscow\u2019s plans to turn East as an alternative, China\u2019s banks just do not have the capacity. Instead, the debt threatens to drain the Kremlin of its $400 billion in foreign currency reserves.Mr. Putin has yet to express publicly how he expects Russia to emerge from its financial problems. At a news conference last month, he addressed concerns about oil by saying that prices had been high enough in the first part of 2014 to finance much of the Russian budget, and that the country would just have to \u201cwait and see\u201d about next year.He also tried to portray the large drop in value of the ruble as useful. \u201cWe used to sell by the dollar and get 32 or 35 rubles in return, but if you look at today\u2019s exchange rate, we get 45, 47 or 48 rubles for every dollar\u2019s worth of what we sell,\u201d he said, and the ruble has reached 54 to the dollar since Mr. Putin spoke. \u201cIn that sense, budget revenue has even increased.\u201dWhile noting that Russia was in far better shape, the editorial said that \u201cthe biggest problem of Russian leadership is inability to admit mistakes.\u201d\u201cThe economy is seriously ill, and the ruble rate is one of the indicators crying about the illness,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cRussia\u2019s leadership refuses to admit there is an illness and pushes it into the depths.\u201dAnton Siluanov, the Russian finance minister, called the report predicting a recession a \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d and said it had not been approved by the entire cabinet. Mr. Siluanov also argued that the ruble was now undervalued after its long slide.Mr. Putin is due to deliver his annual State of the Nation speech on Thursday, and there has been much speculation that he will announce more liberal or more centralized economic policies. Some economists think that the policy is essentially to wait out the sanctions, with the Kremlin anticipating that they will expire in a year and that then all the financial problems will diminish.The crisis is still likely to force significant cuts in public spending. The Ministry of Economic Development, which publishes the government\u2019s economic outlook, on Tuesday revised its 2015 forecast to show a contraction of 0.8 percent, compared with a previous projection of 1.2 percent growth. Private assessments said there could be a drop of 2 percent.The setbacks have slowed or eliminated goals to achieve higher wages, better health care and cheaper housing, ambitions laid out in a series of populist decrees Mr. Putin signed on his first day in office for a third term, in 2012.The 11 decrees described a \u201ctransformation strategy for society\u201d for his new six-year term, including creating 25 million \u201chighly productive\u201d jobs, raising life expectancy to 74 years and raising the birthrate.\u201cRussia is in an economic crisis,\u201d said Kirill Rogov, an independent economic analyst. \u201cOf course, all those grand plans are irrelevant now.\u201dIt is impossible to predict whether the economic woes might inspire antigovernment demonstrations. There have been minor protests in Moscow by medical professionals denouncing the closure of about 28 clinics in the capital and the dismissal of 10,000 medical staff members.But the effects of the economic crisis are just starting. Once constituents like pensioners realize the ruble is losing its purchasing power, they can be expected to demand raises so they can buy as much as before. But state companies will be first in line.\u201cThe problem is that he cannot deliver on his economic promises, so he has to deliver on post-imperial nostalgia,\u201d Mr. Guriev said of Mr. Putin. \u201cHe will say that we are not rich anymore, but we are at least feared.\u201dThe annexation of Crimea lifted Mr. Putin\u2019s ratings into the stratosphere, raising concerns that he might try similar moves elsewhere, like Moldova, to distract people if the economic crisis deepens.The crisis and three rounds of Western sanctions seem to have produced a distinct shift in the propaganda on state television and elsewhere, from triumphalism to a determination that Russians are ready to make any kind of sacrifice to win a showdown with the United States.A billboard on the main Sadova ring road around Moscow recently proclaimed, \u201cThere are more important things in life than the financial market,\u201d and made references to Russian history.\u201cThey are moving from greatness to suffering hardship, because we are fighting American domination,\u201d Mr. Milov said. \u201cIt is a totally different definition of the mission.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Battle Over Douglas Elmendorf \u2014 and the Inability to See Good News", "Date": "2014-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPropensity for PessimismMany Senate hearings are mere theater, but one that took place on July 16, 2009, mattered. With Congress in the midst of writing the bill that became Obamacare, senators asked Douglas Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, to evaluate their efforts.In the hearing\u2019s pivotal moment, Senator Kent Conrad \u2013 the North Dakota Democrat who was then the Budget Committee chairman \u2013 asked Mr. Elmendorf whether the legislation was likely to curb the growth in health costs, as its advocates asserted.\u201cFrom what you have seen,\u201d Mr. Conrad asked, \u201cdo you see a successful effort being mounted to bend the long-term cost curve?\u201dMr. Elmendorf\u2019s answer was clear. \u201cNo, Mr. Chairman,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not see the sort of fundamental changes that would be necessary to reduce the trajectory of federal health spending by a significant amount. And on the contrary, the legislation significantly expands the federal responsibility for health care costs.\u201dFor anyone who remembered health care history, the moment was ominous. It recalled the role that the budget office \u2013 Congress\u2019s official scorekeeper \u2013 played in scuttling President Bill Clinton\u2019s efforts to pass a health care bill. (Mr. Elmendorf, as it happens, was an obscure staff member on the C.B.O. team evaluating the Clinton bill.)Ultimately, the C.B.O. judged those provisions to be substantive. The Affordable Care Act would reduce the deficit in the long run, the budget office forecast, because its new taxes and its cost-cutting would exceed the new spending on health coverage for the uninsured.This column isn\u2019t going to take a position on Mr. Elmendorf. I understand why Republicans might want to appoint one of their own, rather than someone who previously worked at the Brookings Institution and the Clinton Treasury Department. I also see why Republicans might see value in re-appointing someone with Mr. Elmendorf\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (which includes a high-level stint at the Federal Reserve) and credibility.How, then, are the budget office\u2019s critics claiming otherwise? Mostly through accounting tricks. For starters, they tend to look only at portions of the health law that spend money and ignore those parts that cut spending or raise taxes. It\u2019s akin to saying a family is going bankrupt because it bought a new car \u2013 while overlooking that it also canceled a vacation and that Mom received a raise.Within the parts of the law that spend money \u2013 the car in my analogy \u2013 critics have ignored programs that are costing somewhat less than expected and emphasized those that are costing somewhat more. Or, perhaps most common, they have made much out of the fact that the law\u2019s costs rise as it covers more people, claiming that the budget office didn\u2019t expect that increase (which is false).I realize that some of these claims aren\u2019t meant to be serious economic arguments. They\u2019re political ones, intended to influence a political choice. But Mr. Elmendorf\u2019s critics are hardly the only ones taking a gloomy view of the health care system, even as the evidence keeps offering new reasons for optimism.Last week\u2019s report on medical costs, for example, showed that health spending made up 17.4 percent of economic output last year, a level that has not changed in four years. It\u2019s stunning. In the previous four years, the share jumped 1.9 percentage points, from 15.5 percent. Back then, analysts viewed an ever-expanding health sector \u2013 one that drove up the deficit, crowded out spending on schools and highways and cut further into Americans\u2019 paychecks \u2013 as inevitable.To be clear, no one should declare victory yet. There is a serious debate about what will happen with health spending in coming years, as the population continues to age and the ranks of the uninsured presumably shrink. But it\u2019s silly to wave away the health-cost slowdown as meaningless \u2013 or to pretend that health costs are actually surging.Twenty-five years ago, Gregg Easterbrook wrote a cover article for The New Republic titled \u201cThe Sky Is Always Falling,\u201d in which he lampooned the rest of the news media for being able to find the dark lining in any economic trend. Wage growth is weak? Start the recession watch. Wages are surging? Time to fear inflation.There are real consequences to such perma-pessimism. If you think every development is cause for gloom, you can\u2019t distinguish between the economy\u2019s real problems \u2013 of which there is no shortage \u2013 with the potential solutions to those problems.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.\nnytimes.com/upshot Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brotherhood Leader\u2019s Arrest in Jordan Is Seen as Warning From Monarchy", "Date": "2014-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 Zaki Bani Rushaid, the provocative deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, has never been shy with his opinions.For years, Jordan did nothing as he railed \u2014 often on nationwide television \u2014 against Jordan\u2019s \u201cmeager\u201d political reforms and what he sees as continued attempts to cozy up to the United States, which he calls \u201cthe cause of tyranny in the Middle East.\u201d Despite his high profile, the kingdom appeared not to see him, or the Brotherhood, as a threat.Then, on Nov. 17, Mr. Bani Rushaid took to his Facebook page with a new complaint, inveighing against the United Arab Emirates, which had recently branded the Muslim Brotherhood movements as terrorist groups. Among his accusations: that the Emirates plays the role of the \u201cAmerican cop in the region,\u201d \u201csupports coups\u201d and is a \u201ccancer in the body of the Arab world.\u201dWithin days, he was behind bars, accused under a recently strengthened antiterrorism law for \u201cacts harmful to the country\u2019s relations with foreign countries.\u201d Last week he lost an appeal for bail, and he is now awaiting trial and a possible sentence of at least two and a half years in prison.The reason for the government\u2019s sudden shift, analysts say, was that he crossed a political line by lashing out at the Emirates, an important ally of Jordan\u2019s and one of several countries in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, that are on a campaign to wipe out the Brotherhood.At least for the moment, analysts do not expect Jordan to join the Egyptians and the Saudis in cracking down hard on the Brotherhood, which has long operated legally in Jordan, where it has its own political party. Instead, they see the detention of Mr. Bani Rushaid, and the earlier detention of a lower-level Brotherhood official, as a warning that the monarchy\u2019s patience will extend only so far. (The other official was taken into custody after harshly criticizing Jordanian authorities for what he suggested was a tepid response to Israel\u2019s latest offensive in Gaza.)\u201cBani Rushaid\u2019s latest criticism of the Emirates was an opportunity for authorities to finally detain the most important figure inside the Muslim Brotherhood and send the group a message to keep their mouth shut,\u201d said Marwan Shehadeh, a political analyst in Amman.The detentions shocked many in the country, where the Brotherhood has mainly been spared the roundups that were common in Egypt before the Arab Spring and are again now that the generals have wrested back control from that country\u2019s branch of the Brotherhood. Already, 200 lawyers in Jordan have signed up to represent Mr. Bani Rushaid in what one of his primary lawyers, Abdul Qader Khatib, said was mainly a symbolic gesture of support \u2014 and a rejection of what many see as a whittling away of civil rights as Jordan\u2019s leaders have become increasingly jittery over the rise of the Islamic State on its borders, in both Syria and Iraq.In the past seven months, prosecutors have detained dozens of Jordanians under the amended antiterrorism law, accusing them of crimes that included joining terrorist groups or promoting them on the Internet. Some of those in custody acknowledge discussing violent Islamist movements on the Internet, though they contend that does not constitute support.But the detention of Mr. Bani Rushaid, and the implied challenge of the Brotherhood, seems to be something quite different from the wider crackdown. In his case, analysts said, it appears to be tied to Jordan\u2019s increasing dependence on the Emirates and other Sunni monarchies that not only are helping keep its troubled economy afloat with infusions of aid, but are also banding tightly together as the Islamic State tries to destroy the status quo in the Middle East.Jordan\u2019s government spokesman, Mohammad Momani, denied that the authorities went after Mr. Bani Rushaid because of their relationship with the Emirates, saying it was instead because he broke the amended security law by speaking out against a friendly country. Critics of the detention, however, point out that speaking against the United States has not landed anyone in jail. And analysts note that the Emirates has a particular hold on Jordan, promising in 2011 more than a billion dollars in grants over five years and, in the first half of this year alone, providing more than $70 million to care for the Syrian refugees in Jordan who are straining the Jordanian budget. The Emirates also hosts about a quarter of a million Jordanian workers, whose remittances are a major source of cash for their families at home.\u201cThe authorities could not remain idle against Bani Rushaid\u2019s angry remarks that could have been interpreted wrongly by its allies Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and Cairo which all have blacklisted the Muslim Brotherhood, let alone the catastrophic economic consequences on Jordan,\u201d a political columnist, Mohammad Abu Rumman, wrote in Al Ghad, an independent daily newspaper, soon after Mr. Bani Rushaid\u2019s detention.No matter the cause, Jordan\u2019s rare challenge to the Brotherhood has raised eyebrows, with front-page reports prominently mentioning the group\u2019s history of relative moderation.The Brotherhood, Jordan\u2019s largest opposition movement, is known for passionately pushing for democratic reform to diminish the relatively unchecked power of the king. But it has not called for the overthrow of the monarchy, not even during the headiest days of the Arab Spring.And although the government is accused of unfairly structuring elections so the number of Islamists in Parliament is limited, it has allowed the Brotherhood to take part. (The group, nonetheless, boycotted the last parliamentary elections, saying that the election law made it impossible for its members to compete on an equal basis with the king\u2019s loyalists.)As the controversy swirls around him, Mr. Bani Rushaid has remained defiant, threatening to sue the prime minister and others for slander. As a result, he is now being denied access to newspapers while in jail as punishment.\u201cZaki\u2019s detention is politically motivated, and under the Constitution, freedom of expression is guaranteed,\u201d said Mr. Qader Khatib, the lawyer on his defense team. \u201cWhat he has been accused of, which is expressing his opinion on social media, goes against the Constitution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Financial Firms Change Plans on Takeovers", "Date": "2014-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside AsiaHONG KONG \u2014 Mainland Chinese financial companies are taking aim at distressed banking assets coming on the market in Europe, having been urged by Beijing to expand their reach beyond emerging markets.The first mainland purchase of a European investment bank was announced last week, with Haitong Securities agreeing to pay 379 million euros, or about $470 million, for an investment bank in austerity-stricken Portugal.That bank, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo de Investimento, is being sold by Novo Banco, the bank carved out of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo after it was rescued in August.For Haitong, one of China\u2019s largest brokerage firms, it is a modest-sized deal, equivalent to 1.5 percent of Haitong\u2019s market value. But it demonstrates the changing character of acquisitions by Chinese financial firms.These days they mostly seek controlling stakes, and now they are scouting Europe for opportunities, avoiding anything too big.\u201cIncreasingly, Chinese financial firms are seeking control deals as a way to expand their global footprint,\u201d said Mayooran Elalingam, head of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Asia-Pacific mergers and acquisitions.\u201cSeveral distressed opportunities are available in eurozone economies, and we expect the Chinese financial services sector to be active in these situations,\u201d he added.Such deals can help Chinese banks gain treasured European banking licenses as well as expertise, notably in debt markets, that can be transferred back home, whereas growth through opening overseas bank branches can be a slow process.This year, the Chinese government began encouraging mainland stock brokers and financial firms to acquire greater international reach, according to investment bankers.\u201cThe government is encouraging the outbound M. & A. push,\u201d said a banker based in Hong Kong, who was not authorized to speak to the news media.The drive for geographic spread reflects China\u2019s efforts to build up overseas bank outlets as the renminbi gains a greater share of global trade.Haitong\u2019s purchase of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo de Investimento, Portugal\u2019s biggest debt underwriting firm, will give it control of a business that earned \u20ac247 million in revenue in 2013, according to analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets, and a ready-made investment banking network in Europe.\u201cAs regulators liberalize the financial industry in China, banks, insurers and securities firms would be on the lookout for asset managers, private banks and wealth managers,\u201d said Bernard Teo, head of financial institutions group investment banking in China with Goldman Sachs.Some bankers do not rule out the possible acquisition of a European commercial bank.The struggling Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the worst-performing European bank in a recent asset-quality review by the European Central Bank, could attract Chinese bids, according to bankers based in Hong Kong.Chinese buyers could also be interested in Novo Banco, which the Portuguese authorities hope to sell in the first half of next year, they added.Until now, Chinese financial companies\u2019 strategy has been based on organic growth and sporadic purchases of minority stakes in foreign firms, mostly in the emerging market sphere.So far this year, they have announced $3.2 billion worth of overseas deals, three-quarters of which were majority stake purchases, according to Thomson Reuters data.The total spending on overseas deals is way below the record $17.9 billion posted in 2007, but back then only 4.3 percent of the deals were for majority stakes.In 2007, just before the global financial crisis erupted, Chinese financial firms and sovereign wealth funds bought stakes in publicly listed global financial companies, including a $5 billion investment in Morgan Stanley.The stock market losses from these ill-timed deals created a headache for executives back home.\u201cChinese financial institutions are likely to shy away from large transformational deals as they have learnt valuable lessons from the investments made during the financial crisis,\u201d said Mr. Teo of Goldman Sachs. Their main goal now, he added, is to serve Chinese corporations expanding globally. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some States See Budgets at Risk as Oil Price Falls", "Date": "2014-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe concerns are cutting across traditional oil states like Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska as well as those like North Dakota that are benefiting from the nation\u2019s latest energy boom.\u201cThe crunch is coming,\u201d said Gunnar Knapp, a professor of economics and the director of the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage.Experts and elected officials say an extended downturn in oil prices seems unlikely to create the economic disasters that accompanied the 1980s oil bust, because energy-producing states that were left reeling for years have diversified their economies. The effects on the states are nothing like the crises facing big oil-exporting nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.But here in Houston, which proudly bills itself as the energy capital of the world, Hercules Offshore announced it would lay off about 300 employees who work on the company\u2019s rigs in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the month. Texas already lost 2,300 oil and gas jobs in October and November, according to preliminary data released last week by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In Louisiana, the drop in oil prices had a hand in increasing the state\u2019s projected 2015-16 budget shortfall to $1.4 billion and prompting cuts that eliminated 162 vacant positions in state government, reduced contracts across the state and froze expenses for items like travel and supplies at all state agencies. Another round of reductions is expected as soon as January.And in Alaska \u2014 where about 90 percent of state government is funded by oil, allowing residents to pay no state sales or income taxes \u2014 the drop in oil prices has worsened the budget deficit and could force a 50 percent cut in capital spending for bridges and roads. Moody\u2019s, the credit rating service, recently lowered Alaska\u2019s credit outlook from stable to negative.States that have become accustomed to the benefits of energy production \u2014 budgets fattened by oil and gas taxes, ample jobs and healthy rainy-day funds \u2014 are now nervously eyeing the changed landscape and wondering how much they will lose from falling prices that have been an unexpected present to drivers across the country this holiday season. The price of natural gas is falling, too.\u201cOur approach to the 2016 budget includes a full review of every activity in every agency\u2019s budget and the cost associated with them,\u201d said Kristy Nichols, the chief budget adviser to Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. \u201cNothing is off the table at this point.\u201dBut Louisiana, which has a smaller and less diversified economy than Texas, is already feeling the sting of the price downturn because it relies on more oil and gas money for its operating budget. Louisiana loses $12 million for every $1 in decline in the annual average price of a barrel of oil, according to Greg Albrecht, the state\u2019s chief economist.\u201cFrom a strictly budgetary perspective, Louisiana is more sensitive to all of this,\u201d said James A. Richardson, a Louisiana State University economist who serves on the state\u2019s Revenue Estimating Conference, which estimates how much money will be available for the budget. \u201cIt shows up in our house much sooner.\u201dGifford Briggs, vice president of the Louisiana Oil & Gas Association, said some sections of the industry were beginning to scale back as reality set in and prices dropped. Though production in existing wells is expected to continue apace in the coming months, companies are already shrinking their drilling and exploration activity, he said.\u201cLandmen say they\u2019re laying off everyone they have right now until things pick up,\u201d he added, referring to the independent firms that provide services to exploration and drilling companies.\u201cI remember one of my supporters was driving a Rolls-Royce, and he was flying a jet airplane,\u201d said Mark W. White Jr., the governor of Texas from 1983 to 1987. \u201cWithin 90 days, he was renting a Ford, and he went from a Learjet to Southwest Airlines. When that bank went out, he went out.\u201dExperts say the situation today could have been far worse if oil-producing states had failed to diversify their economies, remaining as dependent on oil and gas tax revenues as they were 30 years ago.The portion of the state budget in Louisiana linked to oil and gas revenue is about 13 percent, compared with 45 percent in the 1980s. The Houston region\u2019s projected job losses in the energy industry are likely to be offset by the nearly 63,000 jobs that it is expected to add in construction, retail, health care, food services and other industries in 2015.But in Houston, one energy job has the purchasing power of three non-energy jobs, according to the Greater Houston Partnership, a regional business association.The scale and duration of the anticipated budget woes in oil-rich states remain uncertain. Economists and industry analysts say it is unclear how low oil prices will drop and for how long.In North Dakota, which the Bakken shale field has made the second-highest producer among oil states behind Texas, officials said a major blow to the state\u2019s oil and gas revenues could delay onetime expenditures for highway improvement or water projects, but the state\u2019s general operations would be relatively unscathed, since only a small portion of its oil and gas money goes toward operations.In Texas, oil and gas loom as a defining characteristic, but the role they play in the state economy, while sizable, has diminished in recent years as other industries, such as health care, biotechnology and software, have grown. Oil and gas jobs make up only about 3 percent of nonagricultural jobs in Texas, a far lower share than government (16 percent) and education and health services (13 percent).\u201cI foresee Texas being the economic magnet that it is, continuing to grow and diversify its economy, so that any drop in the price of oil will be minimized,\u201d said Greg Abbott, who will be sworn in as the governor of Texas next month.Still, the economic forecast in Texas has become a shade gloomier for the first time in years. The drop in oil prices over the last six months has amounted to a loss of $83 million per day in potential revenue for the industry in Texas, the Greater Houston Partnership said in a recent report.To some Texans, the volatility and uncertainty are a routine part of life in an oil state.\u201cWe have these cycles,\u201d said Jerry Patterson, the Texas land commissioner and a former state senator who recalled being laid off from a job as a salesman in Houston during the oil bust of the 1980s. \u201cI can remember 30 years ago when $40 oil was a big-time plus. And it went down to, I think, under $10, and you would see bumper stickers that said, \u2018Dear Lord, please bring back $40 oil. I promise I won\u2019t screw it up this time.\u2019\u201dManny Fernandez reported from Houston, and Jeremy Alford from Baton Rouge, La. Kirk Johnson contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil\u2019s Swift Fall Raises Fortunes of U.S. Abroad", "Date": "2014-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 A plunge in oil prices has sent tremors through the global political and economic order, setting off an abrupt shift in fortunes that has bolstered the interests of the United States and pushed several big oil-exporting nations \u2014 particularly those hostile to the West, like Russia, Iran and Venezuela \u2014 to the brink of financial crisis.The nearly 50 percent decline in oil prices since June has had the most conspicuous impact on the Russian economy and President Vladimir V. Putin. The former finance minister Aleksei L. Kudrin, a longtime friend of Mr. Putin\u2019s, warned this week of a \u201cfull-blown economic crisis\u201d and called for better relations with Europe and the United States.It might even have been a late factor in Cuba\u2019s decision to seal a rapprochement with Washington.Iran has been hit so hard that its government, looking for ways to fill a widening hole in its budget, is offering young men the option of buying their way out of an obligatory two years of military service. \u201cWe are on the eve of a major crisis,\u201d an Iranian economist, Hossein Raghfar, told the Etemaad newspaper on Sunday. \u201cThe government needs money badly.\u201dVenezuela, which has the world\u2019s largest estimated oil reserves and has used them to position itself as a foil to American \u201cimperialism,\u201d received 95 percent of its export earnings from petroleum before prices fell. It is now having trouble paying for social projects at home and for a foreign policy rooted in oil-financed largess, including shipments of reduced-price petroleum to Cuba and elsewhere.Amid worries on bond markets that Venezuela might default on its loans, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was elected last year after the death of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, has said the country will continue to pay its debts. But inflation in Venezuela is over 60 percent, there are shortages of many basic goods, and many experts believe the economy is in recession.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d said Strobe Talbott, who was President Bill Clinton\u2019s senior Russia adviser in the aftermath of the Soviet Union\u2019s 1991 collapse and is now president of the Brookings Institution in Washington.Russia\u2019s troubles have rippled around the world, slashing bookings at ski resorts in Austria and spending on London real estate; spreading panic in neighboring Belarus, a close Russian ally; and even threatening to upend Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, which pays players in rubles.\u201cIt is a big boost for the U.S. when three out of four of our active antagonists are seriously weakened, when their room for maneuver is seriously reduced,\u201d Mr. Luttwak said, referring to Russia, Iran and Venezuela.The only major United States antagonist not hurt by the drop in oil prices is North Korea, which imports all of its petroleum.David L. Goldwyn, who was the State Department\u2019s international energy coordinator during President Obama\u2019s first term, warned that an implosion of Venezuela\u2019s economy could hurt the Caribbean and Latin America in ways that the United States would not welcome.But \u201con balance, it\u2019s positive for the U.S.,\u201d he said of the low price of oil, because American consumers save money, and \u201cit harms Russia and puts pressure on Iran.\u201d Even some of the indirect consequences of the price slump, like last week\u2019s break in the half-century diplomatic logjam between Washington and Havana, have generally worked in the United States\u2019 favor. Fearful that Venezuela, its main benefactor, might cut off supplies of cash and cheap oil, Cuba sealed a historic deal that has in turn lifted a shadow over the United States\u2019 standing in much of Latin America.Another casualty of the price collapse has been Belarus, a former Soviet territory long reviled by American officials as Europe\u2019s last dictatorship. It produces no significant amount of crude oil itself but has nonetheless taken a big hit. This is because its economy depends heavily on the export of petroleum products that Belarus produces using crude oil supplied, at a steep discount, by Russia.Others speculate that Persian Gulf oil producers, though still wealthy, might trim their financial support for radical Islamist rebel groups in Syria.Mr. Muasher said the drop in oil prices could also prod Middle East oil producers toward political and economic change by challenging so-called rentier systems in which governments derive much of their income from rents paid by foreigners for resources. \u201cWhatever the case, it is clear that the effect of the new oil price levels will not be limited to the economic sphere,\u201d he wrote in a Carnegie report.This view is particularly strong in Russia, where former K.G.B. agents close to Mr. Putin have long believed that Washington engineered the collapse of the Soviet Union by getting Saudi Arabia to increase oil output, driving down prices and thus starving Moscow of revenue.In many ways, the recent price fall really is the United States\u2019 work, flowing to a large extent from a surge in American oil production through the development of alternative sources like shale.By offsetting declines in conventional oil production, increases in shale oil output have allowed overall American crude oil production to rise to an average of about nine million barrels a day from five million a day in 2008, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. That four-million-barrel increase is more than either Iraq or Iran, the second- and third-largest OPEC producers after Saudi Arabia, produces each day, and it has put strong downward pressure on world prices.The geopolitical shakeout set off by the oil market has not gone entirely America\u2019s way. Russia\u2019s troubles have so far shown no sign of pushing Mr. Putin toward a more conciliatory position on Ukraine, and some analysts believe they could make Moscow even more pugnacious and prone to lashing out.The Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, which monitors possible systemic threats, warned in minutes released this week that \u201csustained lower oil price also had the potential to reinforce certain geopolitical risks.\u201d It voiced alarm, too, over an increased risk of deflation in the eurozone, the 18-nation area that uses Europe\u2019s common currency.The price drop could also encourage more freewheeling use of oil products like gasoline, undermining what appears to be a growing consensus among nations that carbon emissions must be reeled in to offset the most dire effects of global warming.While authoritarian oil producers like Russia are clearly suffering, China is enjoying a huge windfall thanks to the price drop. It imports nearly 60 percent of the oil it needs to power its economy.China became the world\u2019s largest importer of oil in 2013, surpassing the United States, and so stands to benefit from plummeting prices. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated last month that every 10 percent decline in the price of oil could increase China\u2019s economic growth by 0.15 percent.Strong growth in China would lift demand for oil and help reduce the current agonies of OPEC, which pumps around a third of the world\u2019s oil but, largely as a result of increased American production, has lost much of its ability to dictate prices by controlling output.In an interview with the Middle East Economic Survey this week, the Saudi energy minister, Ali al-Naimi, indicated a fundamental rethinking by OPEC, saying that it needed to focus on keeping its market share rather than trying to raise prices by slashing production. \u201cWe have entered a scary time for the oil market,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Stanley Reed from London; Jane Perlez from Beijing; David D. Kirkpatrick from Cairo; William Neuman from Caracas, Venezuela; Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran; and Simon Romero from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Better News on Jobs, but Not Good Enough", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, still much higher than on the eve of the recession seven years ago but a more-or-less steady, if painfully slow, improvement from the recession-era high of 10 percent in October 2009 and 7 percent as recently as one year ago. Yet, it is still too soon to say with any confidence that the labor market has found its footing. Some of November\u2019s unexpected strength in job creation could turn out to be the result of seasonal factors. And even if the growth numbers hold up, problems persist in job quality, as measured by pay and working conditions. For example, the 9-cent increase in average hourly wages in November, to $24.66, while welcome, is not enough to make up for prolonged wage stagnation. Measured year to year, hourly wage growth hasn\u2019t accelerated since 2010; it remains stuck at around 2 percent, which is barely ahead of inflation. When hourly wages are flat, the only way to earn more is to work more. In November, the average workweek for all employees rose modestly, to 34.6 hours. A longer workweek is a good sign in an economy beset with part-time jobs. But it also means that gains in average weekly pay in the past year stem from more hours at stagnant wages. Worse, the averages mask deep wells of weakness. Supervisors and managers got most of the pay raises and extra hours in November. For production and nonsupervisory workers who make up the vast majority of the work force, average hourly pay rose by only 4 cents, to $20.74, and the average workweek was unchanged, at 33.8 hours.Even that overstates the day-to-day reality and prospects of many workers. Fully a quarter of the jobs created in November were in retail and in leisure and hospitality, fields that in general do not offer enough pay or hours to make a living. For example, average hourly pay for nonsupervisors in retail jobs was $14.49; for those in leisure and hospitality, it was $14.10. Other large fields, including fast food and home care, pay far less than that. The November report is the best one in a long time. But it is not nearly good enough. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russians See Costlier Food as No Crisis", "Date": "2014-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeKHOTKOVO, Russia \u2014 In the early days of 1992, prices here exploded by an average of 350 percent as post-Communist Russia crash-landed into a free market economy. Six years later, in August 1998, prices again gyrated wildly after the Russian government devalued the ruble and defaulted on its debts.In comparison, this year\u2019s plunge in the value of the ruble seems positively tame, which may explain the relative stoicism among shoppers here as they shuffled along snow-covered paths, making the rounds of the shops and getting ready for the long holiday season.That isn\u2019t to say that inflation \u2014 now above 10 percent \u2014 is not on everyone\u2019s mind. Several store managers said the same thing: Prices have been going up with each delivery. In a store in the nearby village of Akhtyrka, the sales clerk advised a couple of elderly shoppers to come back later, after she had updated the price list. For consumers and retailers alike, Russia\u2019s latest economic crisis has come in stages. The first impact was felt last summer, when Russia retaliated against the West for Ukraine-related sanctions by imposing a ban on food imports from the United States, the European Union and several other trading partners. The second blow came after the value of the ruble took a deep plunge in mid-December, before bouncing back somewhat. A third is expected as rising interest rates choke off credit. Here in Khotkovo, a town of 23,000 people 60 kilometers, or about 35 miles, northeast of Moscow, tracking the impact of the self-imposed sanctions is like proving a negative. A variety of goods \u2014 from basmati rice to imported hard cheeses \u2014 have simply vanished, leaving consumers with fewer and less desirable choices. A store on the main square that specializes in food from Belarus, Russia\u2019s western neighbor and an ally of sorts, dodged the first bullet. Belarus never imposed sanctions, but now the drop in the value of the ruble is having an effect, said the store\u2019s manager, who declined to give his name. He estimated that prices had over all increased 10 percent to 15 percent in the last month, and like others, he didn\u2019t dare venture a prediction for 2015. After a decade of sustained economic growth, Russian consumers are more resilient than they were in 1992 or 1998, and as they shop for their traditional New Year\u2019s Eve feasts, many are shrugging off the higher prices.Housewives standing in line at a meat counter said they were prepared to make do with less. Marina, who declined to give her last name, said that beef prices \u2014 now at 600 rubles a kilo (roughly $5.40 a pound) \u2014 had probably gone up at least 25 percent but that this wouldn\u2019t stop her from serving it for the traditional New Year\u2019s Eve feast. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage,\u201d she said.Several shopkeepers said they were running through old stocks, which would explain why such anomalies as Finnish dumplings or Italian coffee can still be found on the shelves. Others explain that importers have figured out ways around the ban, bringing European goods through Belarus, where they are relabeled and brought across the border to Russia. Countries like Brazil have also stepped up exports to Russia, although typically at higher prices.Ever since the food ban was introduced last summer, the Russian government has used the opportunity to encourage local producers to fill the gap. That has already had some effect: By October, domestic meat production was up 12 percent, according to government statistics.Until this crisis hit, Russian consumers said, they were not aware of their dependence on imported food. Now, as their currency loses value, putting Western goods out of reach, they welcome government-backed efforts to step up domestic production. \u201cWe were living in some kind of dream world,\u201d said a man who identified himself only as Alexei, who owns a food emporium on the edge of town. \u201cThey should have made this effort long ago, instead of living off oil and gas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Health-Cost Slowdown Isn\u2019t Just About the Economy", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthI can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen to health costs in the next several years, but I do think the government\u2019s analysts are putting an overly pessimistic spin on the numbers. When you look at the data in its entirety \u2013 not just over the last decade or two but going back to the 1960s \u2014 you see that the pattern over the last several years is not normal, even for a time of weak economic growth.The normal pattern over the last 50 years has been for health care to take up a larger share of the American economy with each passing year. It has happened in both good times and bad.Our high health costs, for example, are one big reason income growth has been so slow in recent years. Employers don\u2019t have a secret stash of money to spend on health insurance. A dollar that goes toward health benefits is a dollar that can\u2019t go toward giving someone a raise. The same goes for state and local governments that must choose between paying for their employees\u2019 and retirees\u2019 medical care and spending money on roads or education.Those same reformers influenced the law known as Obamacare, and the law also plays a role. One provision has prodded hospitals to reduce the rate at which patients return to the hospital shortly after discharge.So why are the government\u2019s experts (and some others) so pessimistic that the slowdown is temporary? I think they are putting too much weight on recent history. See, there is one other period in the last 50 years that looks like the last few years, and it\u2019s recent enough that today\u2019s health analysts lived through it: the 1990s.In the aftermath of the 1990-91 recession and the slow recovery that followed, health spending stopped growing more quickly than the rest of the economy. It accounted for 13.4 percent of economic output in 1996, the same share as it had in 1993.But the weak economy doesn\u2019t seem to have been the main reason. The rise of health maintenance organizations (or H.M.O.'s) \u2013 along with other attempts by insurers to hold down costs \u2013 was. Consider that the economy started growing rapidly again in 1996, but a suddenly flush American population didn\u2019t start buying vast amounts of new medical care. Health spending stayed between 13.3 percent and 13.4 percent of economic output until 2000.As I said, I can\u2019t tell you what the future will hold, but the simple cyclical economic story that some analysts prefer doesn\u2019t seem to fit with the historical evidence. It\u2019s simply not true that G.D.P. and health costs have historically moved in tandem. On the other hand, the experience of the 1990s demonstrates that a slowdown in health costs isn\u2019t guaranteed to persist.The American health care system really is changing. What happens next will be one of the biggest economic stories of the coming decade.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article gave an incorrect time element in the photo caption.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Anti-Austerity Duo", "Date": "2014-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsAmong the many consequences of Europe\u2019s years-long economic crisis is the hardening of the eurozone into two camps: a pro-austerity side, led by Angela Merkel of Germany and, under Nicolas Sarkozy, France; and a pro-stimulus side, which comprises pretty much everyone else.The crisis continues, but the days of Franco-German neoliberal dominance (known around Europe as \u201cMerkozy\u201d) are gone. Not only is Mr. Sarkozy no longer president, but the Continent\u2019s weak recovery has raised questions about the wisdom of Berlin-centric austerity. Outside Germany, many have been missing an anti-Berlin leader.Suddenly, there are two candidates for that role: Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy. They are both young and telegenic, and have positioned themselves against the Berlin consensus. Because Europeans love silly wordplay, the pair have been called, in The Economist and elsewhere, \u201cVallenzi.\u201dThese young leaders are at the helm of the second- and third-largest economies in the eurozone, and their performance could determine whether critics are right that the region is headed for a Japanese-style era of deflation and stagnation. But while the European media have focused on their similarities, what is more interesting is their differences \u2014 and whether those differences will prevent them from mapping a new path forward for the Continent.Mr. Valls and Mr. Renzi seem predestined to make a powerful political couple. They lead two of the most sclerotic economies in the European Union. They are both nominally left-wing premiers who seem to be inspired by Tony Blair\u2019s modernization of social democratic policy making in Britain. They have risen arguing for domestic structural reform, paired with more economic stimulus at the supra-national level. They argue for growth ahead of redistribution. They are also technically unelected, having been appointed by a president (Mr. Valls) and by the largest party in Parliament (Mr. Renzi).But their differences are more important. Where Mr. Renzi is pragmatic, accommodating and willing to take risks at home, Mr. Valls is cautious and ideological.Take their divergent approaches to their budgets, which have to receive approval from the European Commission. Mr. Renzi\u2019s first principle has been to show that he and his government can be good fiscal stewards at home, believing that only by establishing his budget bona fides can he push for concessions on more European Union-level stimulus.But he also framed his approach in rhetoric about a New Deal for Europe, a grand bargain in which countries like Italy would make reforms at home in exchange for help from abroad. He even gave his message a populist tinge: \u201cItaly respects the rules, but not the approach where 0.1 percent matters more than politics.\u201d It is a challenge to Berlin, but one that Ms. Merkel might find hard to resist.The contrast with France is stark: Mr. Valls\u2019s government chose to ignore previous budgetary requirements, saying it had already done whatever was possible. \u201cTo try and do more would be impossible,\u201d Mr. Valls stated laconically. The commission wasn\u2019t convinced, and it criticized his government for having \u201cnot taken effective action for 2014 at this stage.\u201dThe domestic contexts in Italy and France also make coordination between the two much more difficult than it was between Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy. Mr. Valls serves under Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the most unpopular French president of the Fifth Republic, and the young prime minister is handicapped by woeful economic problems that Mr. Hollande\u2019s far-reaching presidential powers and old-left policies have only deepened.Mr. Renzi does not have an unpopular president to answer to. In his short months in office, he has transformed the Italian political scene, crushing dissent within his party and then finding common ground with the Italian left\u2019s worst nightmare, Silvio Berlusconi. Unlike Mr. Valls, Mr. Renzi has already delivered some of his promised reforms. He has enacted meaningful tax cuts for companies, curbed social-welfare contributions and begun a labor reform process that strikes at Italy\u2019s notorious anti-layoff rule. Italy is also moving to ease the almost mythological paralysis of its political and judicial system.When unions quickly derided Mr. Renzi as \u201cThatcherite,\u201d he struck back, accusing them of defending ideology over people. This is the kind of attitude we have not heard from Mr. Valls.\u201cVallenzi\u201d is a chimera; Mr. Renzi is proving to be the much better politician. But politics isn\u2019t a sport. Neither Italy nor France is, alone, strong enough to challenge the Berlin consensus and define a new path toward sustained economic recovery. If they can\u2019t come together, then they risk not only allowing Berlin to continue to push its austerity strategy, but also enabling the continued resurgence of populist, nationalist parties across the Continent.Obviously, Mr. Valls needs to get better at daring politics. But both leaders could do more to work together, making common cause in negotiations with Germany and the European Commission. If Mr. Valls and Mr. Renzi managed to substantially reform the labor market and welfare system, their countries would return to growth, be in a better position to shape common European Union rules and put pressure on those urging them to go down this path to adhere to the rules themselves.Until then, Ms. Merkel stands alone \u2014 powerful, uncontested and not ready to listen to voices from outside Europe\u2019s austerity echo chamber.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gregarious and Direct: China\u2019s Web Doorkeeper", "Date": "2014-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 When a major Chinese-American Internet conference convenes in Washington on Tuesday, a middle-aged Communist Party propaganda chief will be seated amid a room full of tech industry executives, American officials and web luminaries.The chief, Lu Wei, might look like the odd man out, but he is certain to command attention. As China\u2019s new Internet czar, he is the doorkeeper for American Internet companies to the lucrative China market, as well as the ambassador of an assertive new policy in which China claims the right to block websites, censor content and track users within its borders.For the Americans, it may present a tricky balancing act, but for Mr. Lu, it is his moment, and one those who know him expect that he will take full advantage of.Given to making stolid, jargon-laden speeches, Mr. Lu, 54, could not be more different from the new generation of businessmen who built the cyberspace sector he oversees, and with whom he has come into frequent combat.But in his rise to become China\u2019s Internet custodian, he has demonstrated a canny awareness of the power of the Internet and social media, while also proving adept at the far older art of manipulating public opinion to benefit the party.Since taking over the State Internet Information Office in 2013 and becoming the director of a powerful Internet committee headed by President Xi Jinping last May, he has tightened restrictions in what is already the world\u2019s most sophisticated system of online censorship.He has curbed the country\u2019s freewheeling social media pioneers by issuing stern warnings in private meetings and severely restricting the accounts of some in a campaign that led to the detention of one online celebrity. On his watch, the government increased blocks on foreign websites and issued new regulations to restrict sharing on social media and increase censorship of popular online video sites.He unapologetically defended China\u2019s need for stronger Internet controls at a trade conference in London in June, and at an October news conference in Beijing, he made it plain that an unfettered Facebook could not expect to operate in China.\u201cI didn\u2019t say Facebook could not enter China, but nor did I say that it could,\u201d he said. \u201cForeign Internet companies can come to China if they abide by the law. We could not allow any companies to enter China\u2019s market and make money while hurting the country.\u201dHis style \u2014 loud, direct and gregarious \u2014 was on display last month when he presided over China\u2019s first World Internet Conference, a gathering of Chinese politicians, top Chinese Internet company chiefs and executives from many major Western tech companies.He smoked cigars with a Cuban telecom official, power-walked in sweats for exercise at the conference site in the whitewashed canal village of Wuzhen and canceled a presentation to dash off to greet Premier Li Keqiang in the nearby town of Hangzhou.\u201cHe pitched his tent and was trying to get everyone to come in,\u201d said one person who has met with Mr. Lu.\u201cHe\u2019s very confident and very definitely a politician,\u201d said the person, who declined to be identified because his meetings with Mr. Lu were confidential. \u201cHe\u2019s a smoker, he drinks, he\u2019s up late, he\u2019s up early, he\u2019s a workaholic. He\u2019s like a ringmaster, trying to be at the center of everything and juggling a million things at once, and he\u2019s pretty good at it.\u201dHe also delivered a message those at the U.S.-China Internet Industry Forum in Washington can expect to hear this week. He called repeatedly for \u201crespect of national sovereignty\u201d on the Internet, arguing that nations should be left to regulate cyberspace within their borders as they see fit.This position clashes with those advocated by human rights groups, which claim free online expression as a basic right, and business interest groups, which call for equal market access for Internet and technology companies.Mr. Lu spent his early career as bureau chief of the state-run Xinhua News Agency in southern Guangxi Province, a position where his flair for showmanship caught the eye of the Beijing headquarters, not least because he made sure that an official car drove to the steps of the plane when an out-of-town boss arrived.He ascended the ranks to become secretary general and vice president at the agency\u2019s headquarters, and in 2011 was promoted to vice mayor of Beijing and chief of the capital\u2019s propaganda department.There he began to expound his views on the Internet. In a July 2010 essay in Seeking Truth, a party philosophy journal, he argued that China should bolster its control over the way information is disseminated internationally in new technologies, like the Internet.After explaining how \u201cphony or distorted information can mislead capital and disrupt markets,\u201d he added: \u201cWithout information security, there is no financial security, there\u2019s no economic security and there\u2019s no national security in the truest sense.\u201dThe essay helped identify what for the Chinese leadership would become a metastasizing fear: the potential of social media to destabilize governments. Later that year, the Arab Spring provided concrete examples.In 2011, the spread of reports about a high-speed rail crash in Wenzhou, China, showed how Chinese social networks could evade the country\u2019s censorship regime. Then in 2013, leaks by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden about United States government surveillance showed how vulnerable countries like China were to cyber-snooping.Last year, while still in the Beijing government, he exhorted the city\u2019s 60,000 propaganda officials to make better use of social media, like the Weibo microblog platform. \u201cWatch Weibo, open a Weibo account, send Weibo messages, study Weibo,\u201d he said, according to Xinhua.\u201cLu Wei was the right man, at the right position, at the right moment,\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a research scholar at Oxford. \"The traditional guard that ran the propaganda department were slightly too hidebound. The idea was they needed clever people who knew what they were talking about. Suddenly someone makes a public stand that shows he understands the Internet and social media as well as its international expansion.\u201dWhen he took over the State Internet Information Office, one of Mr. Lu\u2019s first challenges was reining in China\u2019s freewheeling social media. He held a series of well-publicized dinners at fancy Beijing restaurants with some of China\u2019s most well-known social media icons. Known as the Big V\u2019s, for verified account, some had millions of online followers and had already shown how they could turn sensitive subjects \u2014 like forced relocations and environmental problems \u2014 into national debates that upset the Communist Party.He warned them to take responsibility for their actions, and later, on national television, he instructed eight prominent bloggers in blunt terms to be more positive.One well known online personality, the American businessman Charles Xue, was later detained for eight months on prostitution charges, though a torrent of official media reports left little doubt the government\u2019s anger at Mr. Xue was based on his online writings.Mr. Lu purged some of the Big V\u2019s by closing down or limiting the functions of their accounts, and he made the threat of further consequences apparent to others at the dinners he hosted.Last year, analysts say, he masterminded a Chinese Supreme Court decision that limits to 500 the number of times a post can be reposted without the original author\u2019s assuming legal responsibility. Because spreading false rumors is a crime, the decision means that anyone who writes a popular but subversive post could be held liable and face prison time.Such measures drew the attention of the Chinese president, analysts say, who rewarded him with the job of director of the new Central Internet Security and Informatization Leading Group, a group headed by the president and charged with strengthening Internet controls, enhancing protection against foreign cyberattacks and developing new technologies.The group is expected to produce a policy document, the analysts said, that will seek to strike a balance between what the government views as a need to further censor domestic social media and block foreign sites, while allowing enough openness for the economy to grow.Mr. Lu, who did not respond to a fax to his office seeking comment for this article, now has his sights on something bigger: gaining a substantial say for China in international oversight of the web. His conference in Wuzhen was largely about that, and he is likely to dwell on it in Washington.The conference, however, also suggested the limits of his approach when he has to depend on diplomacy and not the heavy hand of government.Late on the last evening, a draft declaration calling for respect for Internet sovereignty was slipped under the doors of participants. In what appeared to be an attempt to rush through a last-minute approval, the document said any feedback and revisions should be submitted by 8 a.m.In a closed-door meeting the next day, when several Western representatives protested, Mr. Lu insisted that some attendees agreed to the document and therefore it could be considered a consensus, according to a person who attended the meeting, who did not want to be identified because it was confidential.After further debate without agreement, Mr. Lu showed some of the pugnacity he is known for. He refused to compromise, leaving the conference without the closing declaration he wanted.\u201cIt was a tense meeting,\u201d the person said. \u201cHe got up and walked out.

{"Headline": "U.S. Declares Bank and Auto Bailouts Over, and Profitable", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Six years after President George W. Bush began the auto bailout, the Obama administration on Friday declared a profitable end to the sweeping federal interventions in Wall Street and Detroit, saying a final sale of stock from General Motors\u2019 former finance arm had closed a turbulent chapter of the financial crisis.The programs \u201cthat helped restart the flow of credit to meet the critical needs of small businesses and consumers are now closed,\u201d declared Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. \u201cAnd while the goal was always to stabilize the economy, and not to make a profit, it is important to recognize the return we have earned for taxpayers.\u201dTea Party, to many of its foot soldiers, stood for Taxed Enough Already, and the bailouts were assumed to be enormous drains on the federal Treasury. Yet in the end, the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the Detroit bailout yielded $15.35 billion in profit, Treasury officials said Friday.\u201cEffectively, today, our rescue of the auto industry is officially over,\u201d President Obama said Friday, opening his end-of-the-year news conference. \u201cWe\u2019ve now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration committed.\u201dIn all, through TARP and other efforts, taxpayers injected $426.35 billion into banks and auto companies. The sale of stock and interest payments brought in $441.7 billion.To critics on the left and the right, however, the numbers were almost beside the point. The impact of the government\u2019s actions \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly \u2014 has deeply resonated economically, politically and socially.The financial crisis and its bailouts were the defining political moment of the last decade. First they put President Obama in office. But they swept into power a new, populist right in 2010, not only in Congress but in state legislatures that redrew political boundaries to lock those gains in place for years.While both the Tea Party and Occupy movements in many ways appeared to embody the political fringe on both sides of the political spectrum, they gave voice to millions of Americans who felt singed, cast aside and marginalized through the sins of corporate America. Conservatives and liberals were left feeling that Washington was willing to do whatever it took to save mega-banks and corporations, while letting the vast majority struggle with unemployment, declining wages, disappearing savings and houses worth less than their mortgages.\u201cWhat we learned from TARP, the stimulus and the Detroit bailout is when big government, big business and big labor join forces at the taxpayers\u2019 expense, it\u2019s the average citizen who is left out,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots. The capital markets have recovered. Gas prices have plummeted and job growth is on a steady rise. But the political scars remain indelible, reflected in a politically polarized nation and the dysfunctional Congress it has elected.\u201cDemocrats are becoming more liberal; Republicans are becoming a lot more conservative and ideological,\u201d said John Spratt, a longtime moderate Democratic House Budget Committee chairman swept aside in the Tea Party wave of 2010. \u201cInstead of converging into a workable relationship, we are diverging, and Lord knows how we will come to a resolution.\u201dGiven the scale of the broader economic losses and the risk the government took to protect Wall Street and Detroit, a $15 billion profit on a $426 billion investment is nothing to celebrate, said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cThat\u2019s an unfortunate and inappropriate message, given the insane costs inflicted on the American people by the actions of some very big banks,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s representative of the broader Treasury attitude around finance: We\u2019ve fixed it. Don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t bother us anymore.\u201d\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d she said. \u201cWashington already works really well for the billionaires and the big corporations and the lawyers and the lobbyists, but what about the families who lost their homes or their jobs or their retirement savings?\u201dLess than $1 billion in taxpayer funds remain scattered in about 35 community banks around the country, but with the sale on Thursday of the government\u2019s last 54.9 million shares of Ally Financial, previously known as GMAC, the Treasury declared the bailouts done.Thanks in part to the recent surge in stock prices, the Ally sale alone recouped $1.3 billion.The bailout of GMAC started Dec. 29, 2008, with a $5 billion infusion in the last days of the Bush administration, but that grew to $17.2 billion as the Obama White House moved to save Detroit. By keeping auto finance arm alive, the administration sought to keep car and truck sales moving and auto dealerships open.With this week\u2019s sale, the GMAC investment yielded $2.4 billion in profit. The government no longer owns any part of the auto industry, Treasury officials announced.Although the overall bailout efforts turned a profit, the auto rescue did not. With Friday\u2019s announcement, taxpayers were left with a $9.5 billion loss. Most of that came from General Motors, which paid back about $39 billion of the $49.5 billion invested.But with auto sales booming and the Big Three Detroit automakers recovered, the Obama administration now points to the Detroit rescue as one of its biggest triumphs.\u201cThe American auto industry is on track for its strongest year since 2005,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve created about half a million new jobs in the auto industry alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Court Orders Arrest of Ex-Executive at Korean Airlines Over \u2018Nut Rage\u2019", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A court issued an arrest warrant on Tuesday for a former Korean Airlines executive whose tantrum over a bag of nuts halted a flight at a New York airport this month and made her a target of national outrage at South Korea\u2019s powerful business dynasties.The Seoul Western District Court ordered the arrest of the former executive, Cho Hyun-ah, 40, who will probably face charges of assaulting flight attendants and disrupting the performance of their duties. The charges stem from an episode on Dec. 5 when Ms. Cho delayed the departure of a Korean Air flight from Kennedy International Airport after a flight attendant in first class served her macadamia nuts in a bag instead of the required bowl.According to witnesses, Ms. Cho flew into a rage, demanding that the aircraft, which had already left the gate, return so that the offending crew member could be kicked off. Ms. Cho\u2019s outburst has become known as \u201cnut rage,\u201d making her and the airline objects of mockery abroad.It also made her the target of angry derision back in South Korea, where Ms. Cho is the scion of one of the wealthy families that control much of South Korea\u2019s export-driven economy. Her father, the chairman of the family-run Korean Air, stripped her of her posts at the airline and also an affiliated hotel chain, and apologized for failing to raise her properly. On Tuesday, she arrived at the court in Seoul dressed in black, her face hung low in shame.However, her shows of contrition have not been enough to appease public anger at the episode, which struck a nerve in a country that harbors deep unease at the domination of major industries by a handful of family-run business groups, known as chaebol. This has made many South Koreans particularly sensitive to what they see as arrogant or overbearing behavior by members of those families, and particularly young heirs like Ms. Cho.Ms. Cho was a vice president in charge of cabin service when she was served the unopened bag of nuts on the flight bound for Seoul\u2019s main international airport in Incheon. Forcing the plane back to the gate caused an 11-minute delay for the aircraft\u2019s 250 passengers, the South Korean news media say.The news media here report that the airline at first brushed aside the episode, saying it was Ms. Cho\u2019s job to discipline flight attendants. But the authorities also believe the company was trying to protect her by urging employees to tell a less incriminating version of events. On Tuesday, the court also ordered the arrest of another Korean Air executive, who is expected to be charged with forcing flight attendants to give false testimony and ordering a flight attendant to delete an email about what happened.Advertisement"}

He lives with and cares for an aunt, who is also disabled. Recently he began receiving disability payments and will be attending computer courses in hopes of finding a job that will place fewer demands on his body.ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Frank Walsh still pays dues to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, but more than four years have passed since his name was called at the union hall where the few available jobs are distributed. Mr. Walsh, his wife and two children live on her part-time income and a small inheritance from his mother, which is running out.Sitting in the food court at a mall near his Maryland home, he sees that some of the restaurants are hiring. He says he can\u2019t wait much longer to find a job. But he\u2019s not ready yet.\u201cI\u2019d work for them, but they\u2019re only willing to pay $10 an hour,\u201d he said, pointing at a Chick-fil-A that probably pays most of its workers less than that. \u201cI\u2019m 49 with two kids \u2014 $10 just isn\u2019t going to cut it.\u201dWorking, in America, is in decline. The share of prime-age men \u2014 those 25 to 54 years old \u2014 who are not working has more than tripled since the late 1960s, to 16 percent. More recently, since the turn of the century, the share of women without paying jobs has been rising, too. The United States, which had one of the highest employment rates among developed nations as recently as 2000, has fallen toward the bottom of the list.Many men, in particular, have decided that low-wage work will not improve their lives, in part because deep changes in American society have made it easier for them to live without working. These changes include the availability of federal disability benefits; the decline of marriage, which means fewer men provide for children; and the rise of the Internet, which has reduced the isolation of unemployment.At the same time, it has become harder for men to find higher-paying jobs. Foreign competition and technological advances have eliminated many of the jobs in which high school graduates like Mr. Walsh once could earn $40 an hour, or more. The poll found that 85 percent of prime-age men without jobs do not have bachelor\u2019s degrees. And 34 percent said they had criminal records, making it hard to find any work.The resulting absence of millions of potential workers has serious consequences not just for the men and their families but for the nation as a whole. A smaller work force is likely to lead to a slower-growing economy, and will leave a smaller share of the population to cover the cost of government, even as a larger share seeks help.\u201cThey\u2019re not working, because it\u2019s not paying them enough to work,\u201d said Alan B. Krueger, a leading labor economist and a professor at Princeton. \u201cAnd that means the economy is going to be smaller than it otherwise would be.\u201dHigh CostsThe trend was pushed to new heights by the last recession, with 20 percent of prime-age men not working in 2009 before partly receding. But the recovery is unlikely to be complete. Like turtles flipped onto their backs, many people who stop working struggle to get back on their feet. Some people take years to return to the work force, and others never do. And a growing body of research finds that their children, in turn, are less likely to prosper.\u201cThe long-run effects of this are very high,\u201d said Lawrence F. Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard. \u201cWe could be losing the next generation of kids.\u201dFor most unemployed men, life without work is not easy. In follow-up interviews, about two dozen men described days spent mostly at home, chewing through dwindling resources, relying on friends, strangers and the federal government. The poll found that 30 percent had used food stamps, while 33 percent said they had taken food from a nonprofit or religious group.They are unhappy to be out of work and eager to find new jobs. They are struggling both with the loss of income and a loss of dignity. Their mental and physical health is suffering.Yet 44 percent of men in the survey said there were jobs in their area they could get but were not willing to take.Jos\u00e9 Flores, 45, who lives in St. Paul, said that after losing a job as a translator for the University of Minnesota\u2019s public health department in 2011, he struck a deal with his landlord to pay $200 a month instead of $580, in exchange for doing odd jobs. He has a cellphone that costs $34 a month and an old car he tries not to drive, and \u201cif I really need clothes or shoes, I go to the thrift store.\u201d He picks up occasional work translating at hospitals, but he has not looked for a regular job since August.\u201cIf for some reason I cannot live in the apartment where I live anymore, then that will be basically a wake-up call for me to wake up and say for sure I need a full-time job,\u201d Mr. Flores said. He added, \u201cIf I start working full time the rent will increase\u201d \u2014 because he would no longer be available for odd jobs.A Changing SocietyMen today may feel less pressure to find jobs because they are less likely than previous generations to be providing for others. Only 28 percent of men without jobs \u2014 compared with 58 percent of women \u2014 said a child under 18 lived with them.\u201cWhen the legal, entry-level economy isn\u2019t providing a wage that allows someone a convincing and realistic option to become an adult \u2014 to go out and get married and form a household \u2014 it demoralizes them and shunts them into illegal economies,\u201d said Philippe Bourgois, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied the lives of young men in urban areas. \u201cIt\u2019s not a choice that has made them happy. They would much rather be adults in a respectful job that pays them and promises them benefits.\u201dAnd technology has made unemployment less lonely. Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, argues that the Internet allows men to entertain themselves and find friends and sexual partners at a much lower cost than did previous generations.Millions of men are trying to find work. And among the 45 percent of men who said they had looked in the last year, large majorities said that to get a job they would be willing to work nights and weekends, start over in a new field, return to school or move to a new city.\u201cI hope it will not take much longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot move forward. I cannot move backward. So I just have to keep pushing.\u201dAs an improving economy drives up hiring and wages, some of those on the sidelines also are likely to return to the labor market. Almost half of those who did not seek work in the last year said they wanted to work.Yet many who have lost jobs will find it difficult to return.David Muszynski, 51, crushed two nerves in his right leg in 2003 while breaking up a fight at a Black Sabbath concert outside Buffalo, ending his career as a concert technician. He worked eight more years as the manager of a sports bar in Tonawanda, N.Y., until that also became too much of a physical strain. In November, he went on federal disability benefits, replacing 60 percent of his income. Mr. Muszynski lives in a duplex he inherited from his mother, renting out the other unit.He said he planned to take a night course to learn how to use a computer in the hope of finding a job that will place fewer demands on his body.\u201cI would rather be working,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t be so bored.\u201dBut few people who qualify for disability return to the work force. Even if they can find work, they are afraid of losing their benefits and then losing their new job.The decline of work is divisible into three related trends.Young men are spending more years in school, delaying their entry into the work force but potentially improving their eventual economic prospects.Michael Cervone, 25, took shelter in school during the bleakest years of the post-recession recovery. He signed up for a triple major at Youngstown State University in Ohio, in early-childhood education, special education and psychology, \u201cjust to better my chances of getting a job because I knew how competitive it was.\u201dBut with the job market improving, Mr. Cervone decided to hurry up and graduate this weekend with a degree in early-childhood education.\u201cIt feels like there\u2019s a lot more jobs opening up, at least in my field,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like it was the right time for me to start on the path that I chose.\u201dAcross the country, 16 percent of prime-age men are not working. Examine non-employment rates for every Census tract.At the other end of the 25-to-54 spectrum, many older men who lost jobs have fallen back on disability benefits or started to draw on retirement savings. For some of those men who worked in manufacturing or construction, and now can find only service work, the obstacle is not just the difference in pay; it is also the humiliation of being on public display.William Scott Jordan, 54, retired from the Army National Guard last December after a decade of full-time duty. He gets a partial disability benefit of $230 a month and a pension when he turns 60. He would like a job until then, but he doesn\u2019t feel able to return to construction work.Mr. Jordan, who lives in Sumter, S.C., checks for new job listings every day and has filled out \u201c15 to 20\u201d applications over the last year \u2014 at places as varied as paint stores and private detective agencies \u2014 but has been invited to only a single interview. He helps take care of his grandchildren. He cleans the house. He tried taking classes.Mr. Jordan and his wife, who works with the families of deployed soldiers, are now living on $25,000 a year rather than $75,000, and he figures they can get by for another year before they start drawing on savings, \u201cor I guess I go find me a job washing dishes.\u201dAfter a moment, Mr. Jordan adds, \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten that low yet.\u201dTrading DownIn the third group are men like Mr. Walsh, too young to retire but often ill-equipped to find new work. Like many sharing his plight, Mr. Walsh did not move directly from employment to the sidelines. He lost a job, and then another, and one more.After waiting two years for work as an electrician, Mr. Walsh took a job in April 2012 at a Home Depot. He was fired a few months later, he said, after he failed to greet a \u201csecret shopper\u201d paid by the company to evaluate employees.He drew unemployment benefits for another year before finding a warehouse job loading groceries for the Peapod delivery service. This time he was fired on Dec. 13 \u2014 like many who have lost jobs, he remembers the date immediately and precisely \u2014 after he asked for a vacation day, he said, to care for his dying mother.Along the way, Mr. Walsh said he had drained the $15,000 in his union retirement account and run up about $20,000 in credit card debt. \u201cWe were constantly fighting because it\u2019s fear,\u201d he said of the toll on his marriage. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the $50 you need for the lights and you don\u2019t have the $300 you need for something else, and it gets kind of personal.\u201dHe keeps paying union dues to preserve his shot at a pension, but that also means he can\u2019t get nonunion work as an electrician. He says he would like a desk job instead. He used email for the first time last month, and he plans to return to community college in the spring to learn computer skills.He says he is determined that his own children will attend college so their prospects will be better than his own.\u201cI lost my sense of worth, you know what I mean?\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cSomebody asks you \u2018What do you do?\u2019 and I would say, \u2018I\u2019m an electrician.'\u201d\u201cBut now I say nothing. I\u2019m not an electrician anymore.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the age of David Muszynski.

{"Headline": "Nations Plod Forward on Climate Change Accord", "Date": "2014-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 Negotiators from around the globe were haggling into Saturday night over the final elements of a climate change agreement that would, for the first time, commit every nation to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 yet would still fall far short of what is needed to stave off the dangerous and costly early impacts of global warming.Delegates from nearly 200 countries have been working for two weeks here, in a temporary complex of white tents at the headquarters of the Peruvian Army, to produce the framework of a climate change accord to be signed by world leaders in Paris next year. Though United Nations officials had been scheduled to release the plan on Friday at noon, longstanding divisions between rich and poor countries kept them wrangling through Friday and into Saturday night. At its core, the draft is expected to require every nation to put forward, over the next six months, a detailed domestic policy plan to cut its emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from coal, gas and oil. Those plans, which would be published on a United Nations website, would form the basis of the accord to be signed next December and enacted by 2020.That basic structure represents a breakthrough in the impasse that has plagued the United Nations\u2019 20 years of efforts to create a serious global warming deal. Until now, negotiations had followed a divide put in place by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which required that developed countries act but did not require anything of developing nations, including China and India, two of the largest greenhouse gas polluters.By requiring action from every country, the Lima framework will fundamentally change the old world order that stymied earlier climate change talks. But on its own, that political breakthrough will not achieve the stated goal of the deal: to slow the rate of global emissions enough to prevent the atmosphere from warming more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit over the preindustrial average. That is the point at which scientists say the planet will tip into dangerous and irreversible effects, such as melting sea ice, rising sea levels, increased flooding and droughts, food and water shortages, and more extreme storms.Speaking to delegates here on Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry said, \u201cWe\u2019re still on a course leading to tragedy.\u201dGiven the current level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and the fact that the new plans would not be enacted until 2020, most experts say the best that can be hoped for is that the deal would cut emissions by about half as much as is needed to stop the 3.6-degree rise.\u201cNobody here thinks an agreement will be a silver bullet that eliminates this threat,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t get anywhere without an agreement.\u201dAbout 2 a.m. Saturday morning, hopes were high that a deal would soon be struck, as the Peruvian environmental officials leading the talks here circulated a draft text that included rigorous provisions laying out how countries must put forth their domestic emissions reduction plans. But in a plenary session Saturday afternoon, the old divide of rich and poor emerged as nations fought over core provisions of the proposal. A bloc known as the Like-Minded Countries, comprising India, China and a number of major oil-developing nations, including Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, demanded that the deal include what is known in United Nations parlance as \u201cdifferentiation.\u201d They insisted on easier requirements than rich nations when putting forth their emissions statistics, balked at proposals that would allow aggressive outside monitoring and verification of each country\u2019s plan before a deal is signed next year, and said that their plans for reducing emissions rates be met with commitments of money in the rich countries\u2019 plans. Poor countries want rich countries\u2019 plans to include concrete pledges to help the poor countries pay to adapt to the coming ravages of climate change, and to help them pay for new, low-carbon technology, such as wind and solar, to replace cheap but heavily polluting coal. But that requirement is nonstarter for rich countries like the United States.Speaking for the Like-Minded Countries, the Malaysian delegate, Gurdial Singh Nijar, said: \u201cWe are in a different stage of development. Many of you colonized us, and we started from a completely different point. Those red lines were not addressed in the text.\u201dMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia has complained that any agreement designed to reduce consumption of fossil fuels like oil threatens its economy. Just as vulnerable island nations have called for financing to help them adapt to the ravages of climate change, Saudi Arabia has called for money to adapt to a world in which its economy is imperiled by climate change policy. Some negotiators feared that the Saudi delegation could try to stop progress on the deal at the last minute.Faced with frustrated nations laying out hard lines, Peru\u2019s environment minister, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, spent Saturday meeting with various blocs \u2014 from the least developed vulnerable countries to states that depend on oil revenue to fuel their economies \u2014 and announced that by day\u2019s end, he would put forth a new draft designed to answer their concerns and would continue the summit meeting\u2019s formal proceedings at 11 p.m.Some delegations are scheduled to leave Lima before then. Privately, some negotiators worried that by that point, with delegates exhausted by lack of sleep, the talks could fall apart entirely. More likely, outside observers said, was the possibility that the new text would represent a weaker, less rigorous deal than had been anticipated. As evening approached on Saturday, workers began dismantling some of the temporary structures that have housed the talks since the end of November. Speaking to the assembly, Todd D. Stern, the lead American negotiator, urged: \u201cFailing to produce a decision on the text before us will be seen as a major breakdown. All that we have achieved thus far and all we hope to achieve will be at risk, as well.\u201dAntonio Marcondes, Brazil\u2019s ambassador to the conference, said he would continue to push for provisions demanding that developing nations receive financing to help them reduce carbon emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change.\u201cWe\u2019re still concerned about differentiation, in all its forms,\u201d said Mr. Marcondes, whose country, like China and India, is one of the world\u2019s largest polluters and also home to millions of impoverished people.In remarks to fellow delegates last week, India\u2019s environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, said the deal \u201cshould be able to address the genuine requirements of the developing countries by providing them equitable carbon space to achieve sustainable development and eradicate poverty.\u201dOne country that had been viewed as a wild card, and as a possible last-minute disrupter in the talks, was Russia. President Vladimir V. Putin has publicly scoffed at the science of human-caused climate change. But the lead Russian negotiator, Oleg Shamanov, expressed criticism this weekend of other countries that had slowed the process of forging a deal.\u201cUnfortunately, again and again, we step on the same rakes,\u201d Mr. Shamanov said about 4 a.m. on Saturday, after a fraught negotiating session broke up. \u201cThe draft is not bad, per se. We strongly support the idea of having meaningful deliverables.\u201d He added that Russia, whose economy is deeply dependent on oil and natural gas production, and is also one of the world\u2019s top five carbon polluters, was already working on its plan to cut emissions.\u201cWe are one of the few countries doing it,\u201d he said. Speaking to the plenary, he surprised many observers, saying, \u201cWe are prepared to support this text.\u201dEven if the divisions expressed Saturday are resolved, much of the success of the Lima deal will be determined over the coming months, as governments put forth their plans.Paul Bledsoe, an aide to President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration on climate change who is now with the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said, \u201cThe really difficult issues \u2014 financing, adaptation, monitoring and ultimate emissions reductions \u2014 are left to be ironed out over the next 12 months.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Natural Gas: Abundance of Supply and Debate", "Date": "2014-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Big FixMEAD, Colo. \u2014 Natural gas is the Rorschach test of energy policy. Depending on one\u2019s point of view, it can be either an essential tool for meeting the challenge of climate change or another dirty fossil fuel that will speed the planet down the path to calamitous warming.They also say that the growing use of plentiful natural gas is accelerating climate change and sapping the urgency to promote energy efficiency and developing renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop searching for a bridge and simply take the leap,\u201d Bill McKibben, an environmental campaigner, said earlier this year.But recent studies suggest the effects of relying on natural gas and expanding its use will provide no lasting benefit to the environment compared with burning coal unless policies are enacted to hasten the adoption of renewable technologies \u2014 to make the bridge a short one. \u201cIn the absence of a climate-change-mitigation policy, having abundant, low-cost natural gas alone is not going to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d he said. Gas-fired plants can also be built relatively quickly and cheaply \u2014 factors that led to a jump in gas-plant construction that actually preceded the natural gas boom.\u201cThe good news is we know we can get significant reductions for marginal cost,\u201d said Mark Brownstein, associate vice president of the organization\u2019s United States climate and energy program. Producers and regulators must do a better job of reducing risk, he said.Fixing the problem of leaking methane can be achieved more easily than many other environmental challenges, said Mr. Harvey of Energy Innovation. Compared with \u201cthermodynamic problems\u201d like making automobiles more efficient and \u201cchemical problems\u201d like reducing smokestack pollutants, methane is largely a \u201cplumbing problem,\u201d Mr. Brownstein said, and \u201cplumbing is dead simple.\u201dHere in Mead, 45 miles north of Denver, a production facility prepares the oil and gas from six wells for pipelines that will take the fuel to processing facilities. The big machines separate oil and recovered fluid from natural gas, and put about six million cubic feet of natural gas into the pipeline every day. Wrench-wielding Anadarko inspectors search for leaks \u2014 \u201cfugitive gas\u201d \u2014 as often as monthly at major facilities, and tighten flanges that may have shaken loose. The equipment, too, is designed to minimize leaks. The valves on these pneumatic devices are run with compressed air; the more standard industry practice is to use the pressure of the extracted natural gas to power them, which means gas can escape. Instead, what is vented here is simply air. Not every company takes such pains, and industry experts say there is a big difference between the best actors and some of the smaller players who generate more than their share of environmental damage. Korby Bracken, Anadarko\u2019s director of health, safety and environmental issues in the Rockies, invited a visitor to look inside the steel smokestack column through a small sight glass. A pilot light burned inside, and after all the effort to capture, contain and sell gas, having it consumed in a six-inch column of flame clearly irked him. \u201cWe\u2019d rather put it in the pipeline,\u201d he said.Anadarko officials say their goal is to use the technologies employed at this site \u2014 which was so clean that a rabbit sat below one of its warm tanks, grooming its ears, on a chilly November day \u2014 wherever possible. Some sites are too remote for an electrical hookup to power air compressors, but the infrared cameras are being used throughout the company\u2019s facilities. In March, the administration announced the plan aimed at reducing methane leaks. The E.P.A., under this \u201cStrategy to Reduce Methane Emissions,\u201d is expected to publish its proposed rules next month.Ultimately, fighting over the relative merits of natural gas compared to other fossil fuels misses the broader energy challenge for the nation and the world, said Steven Cohen, the executive director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. \u201cEverybody\u2019s looking for a big fix \u2014 a magic bullet,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the existing technologies will do what we need to do to get to the renewable energy economy.\u201d The challenge, he added, is to spur the same kind of technology revolution that transformed bulky computers into pocket-size devices.\u201cYou need some kind of technology that doesn\u2019t exist now,\u201d he said.

You\u2019d feel pretty bad. Correspondingly, you\u2019d probably feel a lot better if and when you finally stopped. What would that improvement in your condition tell you?It certainly wouldn\u2019t imply that hitting yourself in the head was a good idea. It would, however, be an indication that the pain you were experiencing wasn\u2019t a reflection of anything fundamentally wrong with your health. Your head wasn\u2019t hurting because you were sick; it was hurting because you kept hitting it with that baseball bat.And now you understand the basics of what has been happening to several major economies, including the United States, over the past few years. In fact, you understand these basics better than many politicians and commentators.No, not at all. What actually happened was that the Tories stopped tightening the screws \u2014 they didn\u2019t reverse the austerity that had already occurred, but they effectively put a hold on further cuts. So they stopped hitting Britain in the head with that baseball bat. And sure enough, the nation started feeling better.What\u2019s the important lesson from this late Obama bounce? Mainly, I\u2019d suggest, that everything you\u2019ve heard about President Obama\u2019s economic policies is wrong. You know the spiel: that the U.S. economy is ailing because Obamacare is a job-killer and the president is a redistributionist, that Mr. Obama\u2019s anti-business speeches (he hasn\u2019t actually made any, but never mind) have hurt entrepreneurs\u2019 feelings, inducing them to take their marbles and go home. And what this bounce tells you is that the alleged faults of Obamanomics had nothing to do with the pain we were feeling. We weren\u2019t hurting because we were sick; we were hurting because we kept hitting ourselves with that baseball bat, and we\u2019re feeling a lot better now that we\u2019ve stopped.So I\u2019m fairly optimistic about 2015, and probably beyond, as long as we avoid any more self-inflicted damage.

{"Headline": "Sinking Oil Price Is Hard on North Sea Producers", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Back in September, when oil was still selling for close to $100 a barrel, North Sea energy reserves were the big prize at stake in Scotland\u2019s referendum on whether to secede from Britain.The Scots voted to keep the kingdom united. But three months later, with oil trading in the $60 range, it is now North Sea oil whose future hangs in the balance.With a 40 percent fall in prices since June, oil producers around the globe are having to recalibrate. Rosneft is gauging the effects of the price on the Russian economy. OPEC nations are wondering how long they can let market prices threaten their cartel. And Texas shale-oil producers are contemplating whether to start another fracking project.Perhaps nowhere else in the global oil industry has the question of moving forward been as clouded by doubt as in the North Sea.If Brent crude, the North Sea benchmark, remains around $60 to $70, at least 85 percent of new British offshore oil and gas resources now in the planning stages are at risk of being dropped, according to the industry consultants Wood Mackenzie.That could mean the abandonment of $27 billion worth of planned development and a threat to the jobs of many of the nearly half a million people in Britain who work directly or indirectly in the oil industry. And at current prices, many older North Sea oil and gas fields could begin losing money, potentially causing them to be shut down.\u201cIt is very hard to keep some businesses afloat at current oil prices,\u201d said Mike Tholen, economics director at Oil & Gas UK, a trade association.How quickly things have changed.The past few years had been a boom time for the British oil industry and its thriving hub, Aberdeen, Scotland. With oil prices mostly stable and consistently above $100, companies were investing at record levels, willing to spend whatever was necessary to keep the petroleum flowing and to bring new resources onstream \u2014 even if it meant venturing farther and deeper offshore.Even before the price plunge, though, the projected cost of some of the most ambitious North Sea projects was making some companies hesitant. BG, the British oil and gas producer, decided this summer to delay its main North Sea project, Jackdaw, when the projected price tag had risen to $5 billion.Chevron likewise delayed a flagship development, Rosebank, in hopes of lowering the break-even point, which Goldman estimates to be $87.50 a barrel for it.Now, with prices for Brent crude far below that level \u2014 at $60.44 on Friday \u2014 the economics of finding and developing those deepwater fields look more daunting. The British oil giant BP, a North Sea leader, recently sent letters to recruitment agencies in Aberdeen, saying it would have to cut wages up to 15 percent for any new oil-worker contractors.The industry\u2019s deteriorating economics threaten to accelerate the long-term decline of production in the British North Sea, now about 1.4 million barrels per day of oil and gas, as new projects are delayed and exploration budgets are cut.Similar forces are playing out in other parts of the world.A big cause of oil\u2019s falling price, besides a slow economy in many parts of the world, is the previously high price. Years of $100 or more for a barrel of oil encouraged the development of oil from shale rock deposits in the United States, as well as other new sources elsewhere, resulting in big increases in the global supply.A recent study by Goldman Sachs estimates that many large new oil and gas projects being planned around the world will not be commercially viable with oil at $70 per barrel.\u201cThe shale revolution is making $1 trillion worth of new oil projects potentially obsolete,\u201d said Michele della Vigna, a London-based Goldman analyst. \u201cThe industry needs to reduce costs by 30 percent to go ahead with these projects at the current oil price.\u201dIf prices stabilize and then bounce back quickly, then the recent drop might soon be forgotten. But a sizable group of analysts say that rather than experiencing a passing blip, the market is undergoing a lasting adjustment to greater abundance of oil and muted economic demand.In Britain especially, executives concede that production costs were allowed to run out of control. Overall operating costs in British waters increased by 15.5 percent, to 9 billion pounds, or about $14 billion, in 2013, according to Oil & Gas UK. The cost of producing a barrel of oil or gas has been rising at about 20 percent per year, to \u00a317 per barrel.Costs per field vary greatly. But 19 North Sea oil fields \u2014 about 6 percent of the total \u2014 now have costs of more than \u00a330 per barrel, which puts them in danger of losing money.No wonder companies are scrambling to cut costs. Conoco Phillips, the large American company, said recently that it would reduce its work force in Britain by about 230 people, to about 1,400.Wood Group, a global oil services company based in Aberdeen, said on Wednesday that it would cut the pay rates for its 1,250 North Sea contract workers by up to 10 percent and freeze the salaries of 4,000 Britain-based employees. \u201cThese measures have not been taken lightly, but we believe they are required,\u201d Dave Stewart, the company\u2019s managing director for Britain, said in a statement.Mr. Tholen of Oil & Gas UK said the fields in the most difficulty were in the northern part of the North Sea. These units, he said, tend to have old pipelines and platforms, which are costly to maintain, while declining production means there are fewer barrels and lower revenue to pay for the operating costs.\u201cIf we have a sustained period in which prices remain in the 50s,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can expect to see parts of infrastructure in the North Sea disappearing.\u201dThe main deterrent to shutting down fields may be the high costs of closing wells and safely disposing of platforms and other offshore equipment. The industry spent \u00a3900 million on such decommissioning last year and is expected to spend nearly \u00a315 billion more through 2023.For the biggest companies, the best bet now may be to wait out the winnowing. With the billions of dollars in cash reserves, built up during the boom, they can probably afford to let the shakeout run its course \u2014 even if the North Sea will not necessarily be where they will put as much emphasis when things pick up.They can figure that the prices of drilling rigs and related equipment like floating production platforms will be cheaper, as demand for the gear ebbs and they are no longer bidding against one another for the services of shipyards in South Korea and elsewhere.\u201cIf you have a bit of cash\u201d it will go much further in the future, said Malcolm Dickson, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the silver linings for the oil industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Turkey Sabotaged Its Future", "Date": "2014-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn other words, as is often the case in Turkey, a war over ideology dominated the agenda, while the practical needs of Turkey\u2019s future generations were overlooked. The National Education Council did not put any emphasis on foreign language instruction, for example, despite the fact that Turks generally fare poorly when it comes to speaking any language other than their own \u2014 particularly languages like English, Chinese or Arabic that could help Turkish businesses grow, both in the region and globally. Nor was there any emphasis on critical thinking or democratic values \u2014 the very qualities that could help transform Turkey\u2019s insular, rigid and intolerant political culture.Some might view these proposals as a sign of Turkey\u2019s regression from an open-minded, secular past, initiated some 90 years ago by the republic\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, to a dogmatic Islamist era spearheaded by Mr. Erdogan. But it would be more accurate to say that Turkey is merely replacing one official dogma with another.Like Mr. Erdogan, Ataturk devalued critical thinking, preferring citizens to accept the truths he decreed as an all-knowing leader. During his single-party rule from 1923 to 1938, Ataturk tried to reshape the nation according to his Kemalist ideology, making sweeping reforms in culture, religion, education, language and science. Some facets of the Kemalist program were relatively eccentric \u2014 like Ataturk\u2019s pseudoscientific thesis that prehistoric Turks in Central Asia were the progenitors of human civilization.Today, after over a decade as prime minister and with plans for at least another decade in power as president, Mr. Erdogan seems to be embarking on a similar mission of nation-reshaping. He is using a language and symbolism that is increasingly similar to Ataturk\u2019s; like Ataturk, he is attempting to teach his people the \u201ccorrect\u201d version of their history. And, like Ataturk\u2019s, his political opponents are branded as traitors.The big difference, however, is ideology. Ataturk was a secular nationalist who wanted to Westernize Turkey. (It was Ataturk who abolished the Ottoman language, in favor of a more modern, Latinized Turkish.) Mr. Erdogan is a conservative Muslim nationalist who sees Westernization as a historic mistake.But wasn\u2019t Mr. Erdogan the same leader who once put Turkey on a path toward European Union membership? That was certainly the case during the initial phase of rule by his Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., from 2002 to 2010. At the time, Turkey was under the thumb of Kemalist generals who threatened elected politicians. Hence, the European Union, and its liberal democracy, looked like a savior for Mr. Erdogan. Yet once the military was subdued, the incentive to Europeanize began to fade.Now Mr. Erdogan even appears to be convinced of a great Western conspiracy to topple his rule; a \u201csupra intellect\"\u2014 none other than the United States, according to some of his supporters in the media \u2014 that manipulates the Middle East and creates trouble for the glorious \u201cNew Turkey.\u201d The irony is that despite all this anti-Western rhetoric in domestic politics, Turkey remains a member of NATO; Ankara still welcomes Western leaders; and Mr. Erdogan vowed, just last month, to \u201cstrengthen the strategic partnership between Turkey and America.\u201dThe deeper trouble is that while Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Muslim nationalism may boost Turkish self-confidence, it risks depriving the next generation of the skills they will need to succeed in a global economy. Sure, Turkey boasts some success stories \u2014 like Turkish Airlines, which is frequently ranked Europe\u2019s best. But it still does not have a highly skilled, creative or innovative workforce. To raise the latter, Turkey needs a much more globalist approach to education, and stronger commitments to the rule of law and meritocratic advancement (the lack of which is rightly recognized by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu).The masters of the \u201cNew Turkey\u201d must curb their lust for power and control and help build an open society that rewards talent. If they don\u2019t, they will go down in history as a poor imitation of the Kemalist \u201cOld Turkey\u201d they have criticized for decades \u2014 with their own official dogma, cult of personality, and endless witch hunts for enemies within. And Turkey will not move forward, but will fall into the vicious cycle once outlined by the great medieval Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun: Conquerors of a system eventually adopt the habits of that system; hope for change lies only in newcomers from the wilderness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Year in Charts", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlthough developments on the political front were certainly dispiriting, for the first time in years, the economic news was not all gloomy. But with the economy improving, there was less focus on the continuing need to address flagging incomes, rising inequality and unbalanced government spending. Below are 10 charts to illustrate the crosscurrents of the past year in economics and politics:By the end of 2014, even the most hardened cynics had to concede that the darkness that had pervaded the American economy since 2008 had lifted a bit. Most visibly, the rate of job growth accelerated, from 194,000 per month in 2013 to 241,000 per month in 2014. By May 2014, the total number of jobs had run past its previous peak in early 2008. Meanwhile, the overall economy began to expand at faster annual rates \u2014 4.6 percent in the second quarter and a remarkable 5.0 percent in the third quarter.An autumn collapse in oil prices brought more good news. A barrel of oil that fetched $107 in June commanded only $55 by Dec. 22. For consumers, that meant gasoline prices that fell to an average $2.38 per gallon, compared with their peak of $3.70 in April. All told, the drop in oil prices was equivalent to an annual tax cut of about $750 per American family. And with the United States still importing an estimated 26 percent of its petroleum, lower prices raise the economy\u2019s growth rate and reduce the balance of payments deficit.Economic news was not all positive. Most important, there were only hints that stagnating wages might finally be turning upward. November figures showed that the cash pay of hourly workers rose by a slender 0.8 percent after adjustment for inflation over the previous year. The picture is modestly better when cash benefits are added to the equation. In the past two years, median family incomes, including items such as pensions, Social Security and unemployment insurance, edged up to about $53,500 from $52,600 in 2012. But they have remained well below their previous peak of $57,500 in January 2008. The decline between 2009 and 2012 was the first time this inflation-adjusted measure had dropped during an economic recovery.Not surprisingly, stagnant wages contributed to rising inequality. In September 2014, the Federal Reserve released a study showing that between 2010 and 2013, only the top 10 percent of Americans saw their incomes increase. Depressingly, incomes for lower- and middle-class Americans fell the most. The news by occupation was similarly discouraging: Wages for manufacturing workers fell by 2.2 percent from January 2010 to November 2014, with those for autoworkers dropping by 11.7 percent. Lower-wage jobs in leisure and hospitality also saw pay fall. Perhaps not surprisingly, higher incomes accrued to those in finance, education and health, and other professions.Happily, the problem of income inequality was brought front and center by the publication of the economist Thomas Piketty\u2019s landmark book, \u201cCapital in the 21st Century.\u201d Originally written in French, weighing in at 696 pages and laden with incomprehensible equations, the book nonetheless spent 22 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, including three weeks at the top. While Mr. Piketty\u2019s solutions, such as a global wealth tax, were mostly impractical or ill advised, his meticulous identification of the problem was unassailable. By 2012, a mere 0.01 percent of American households \u2014 earning an average of $21.5 million annually \u2014 commanded a near-record 4.1 percent of all income, compared with 0.5 percent when income inequality hit its trough in 1973.The federal government does far less to ameliorate the disparities than the governments of other developed countries. As measured by the Gini coefficient (the higher the number, the more unequal), inequality in the United States is no worse than in most developed countries when calculated without regard to taxes and transfer payments such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps and the like. But because social programs in European countries are so much more expansive, inequality in the United States tops the list. The rush to cut government programs will only exacerbate this disparity.After a website meltdown in late 2013, this year brought proof that the Affordable Care Act was delivering on its promises: More than 11 million previously uninsured Americans are now covered by a health care plan, about half of them Medicaid recipients at the bottom of the economic ladder. Another 16 million Americans who were previously insured also signed up \u2014 many of them had substandard plans that were upgraded as a result of the A.C.A. In late 2014, Americans had their second opportunity to enroll in health care plans under the auspices of the new law. The process went off smoothly, a stark contrast to the chaos of the previous year.It\u2019s hard to view the results of the 2014 midterm election as anything other than a referendum on President Obama. In fact, a statistical analysis of 10 key Senate races shows that the president\u2019s low popularity ratings explain about 65 percent of the vote shares achieved by these individual Democratic candidates. In Arkansas, where President Obama\u2019s approval rating was only 34 percent, the incumbent, Mark Pryor, received less than 40 percent of the vote. Weak candidates in states like Kentucky and Louisiana underperformed their predicted vote share. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire and Mark Warner in Virginia benefited from the president\u2019s relatively high popularity (40 percent!) but still had to outperform their expected shares to win re-election.Not surprisingly, a new Pew study found that the American public continued to grow more polarized, with both Democrats and Republicans moving further into their ideological corners. Today, 94 percent of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican, compared with 70 percent back in 1994. Similarly, 92 percent of Republicans are to the right of the typical Democrat, compared with 64 percent 20 years earlier. This is reflected in a Congress that is also more polarized than it has been in at least 100 years, as measured by the voting records of individual legislators.Greater polarization is at least one of the reasons for gridlock on Capitol Hill that remained at least as bad in this Congress as in the prior one. As of Nov. 30, the Congress that will depart at the end of this month succeeded in passing only 186 public laws, many of them minor or simply ceremonial. When the books are finally closed, the 113th Congress may have hauled its legislative total up to that of its predecessor, the current record holder for inaction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Solution to Income Stagnation, Republicans and Democrats Revise Their Playbooks", "Date": "2014-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoFor average American families, the United States economy is like a football team that cannot move the ball, and has not been able to for 30 years.That is why frustrated economists in both parties are scrambling for a new playbook. Increasingly, they are looking away from grinding runs up the middle toward more freewheeling, long-yardage plays.Among Democrats, that means greater government spending on education, infrastructure and even direct job creation. Among Republicans, it means far-reaching shifts in taxation and regulation. Those debates will help shape economic policy for the rest of President Obama\u2019s term and during the 2016 campaign.The economy has finally emerged from the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007-9. Employers added 314,000 jobs in November, and third-quarter output grew at a strong 5 percent annual rate with no signs of resurgent inflation.But the generation-long stagnation of middle-class incomes continues.From 1947 to 1979, the postwar economic boom more than doubled median family income to $58,573 in 2013 dollars. Had earnings growth kept that pace through the careers of baby boomers, median family income would have topped $124,000 by 2013. Instead, it was $63,815.The magnitude of that lengthy slowdown makes many government policy responses look small. The Bush tax cuts saved a median-income family of four about $2,000 per year. If such a family contained one full-time worker making the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed wage hike to $10.10 would add about $6,000 a year.In a competitive global economy, Democratic strategy starts with improved education and training to enhance workers\u2019 skills and productivity. Mr. Obama has unsuccessfully asked Congress to spend $75 billion more annually on early childhood education, but some allies advocate much more.\u201cMy long bomb would be enacting a very large human capital strategy,\u201d said Austan Goolsbee, the University of Chicago professor who once chaired Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. For such a plan, Professor Goolsbee would allocate as much as 3 percent of gross domestic product, or more than $500 billion per year \u201cacross as many different dimensions as you could,\u201d from early education to community colleges to vocational training matching worker skills to employers\u2019 needs. Yet, even in the best case scenario, big gains would take years. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s going to solve everything you\u2019re kidding yourself,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, the former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.In an era of Tea Party backlash against Washington, Mr. Bernstein backs the politically risky idea of direct government job creation to tighten labor markets, bid up wages, and enhance prospects for the long-term unemployed. Every $1 billion in government spending, a recent analysis concluded, would create 100,000 \u201csubsidized jobs\u201d paying $10 per hour for six months.More Democrats support infrastructure spending to create short-term jobs and boost long-term economic potential with better seaports, airports and highways. Mr. Obama, unsuccessfully, has proposed $10 billion for a new \u201cinfrastructure bank\u201d and another $22.5 billion annually in new highway spending.Lawrence H. Summers, a former director of the National Economic Council, advocates something far grander: $200 billion annually in new public and private infrastructure spending for 10 years. He calculates that low borrowing costs mean the investment would produce handsome returns.For Democrats especially, boosting economic growth represents only part of the solution. Another part is countering economic trends that have most benefited the highest-earning families.Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, offers one \u201cradical\u201d idea that would not cost a dime. Under current law, tax brackets rise each year to protect everyone from the effects of inflation. Mr. Burman would target those adjustments to people with stagnant incomes.Reallocating inflation protections each year, projected to reach $200 billion by 2025, \u201cwould push gently against the winds of rising economic inequality,\u201d Mr. Burman wrote recently.Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist, would push harder. In an economy producing big gains for businesses but not for workers, he proposes turning more workers into owners.That would involve expanding incentives for workers to acquire stock in their employers, and for employers to offer workers incentive pay tied to the firm\u2019s profitability. \u201cWe presented some of these things to the Obama administration and the Wall Street guys just killed them,\u201d said Professor Freeman, a co-author of \u201cThe Citizen\u2019s Share: Putting Ownership Back into Democracy.\u201d The Republican debate consists largely of getting government out of the way. Support by Jeb Bush, a prospective Republican presidential candidate, for Common Core educational standards cuts against the grain of his party.In a recent manifesto by the conservative YG Network, Michael Strain proposed reducing occupational licensing for some industries, like cosmetology. James Pethokoukis, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute said shorter copyright terms for books, movies and other intellectual property would spur fresh innovation and job creation.Others promote overhauling energy policy. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, backs capitalizing on this \u201cmost important economic event of the last decade\u201d by lifting the longstanding ban on United States oil exports and relaxing restrictions on liquefied natural gas exports.Others envision transformational effects from seizing on energy shifts to revamp the tax code. By moving away from taxing income toward taxing energy sources, said Steve Bell, a longtime Senate Republican aide now at the Bipartisan Policy Center, the United States could boost investment and growth, curb climate change and generate revenue to finance a currently insolvent entitlement system.Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, proposes a new $2,500 tax credit for families with children. But the most popular conservative idea for boosting incomes is overhauling corporate taxation. Mr. Obama has embraced that goal if Congress closes enough loopholes while lowering the 35 percent top rate to ensure the government will not lose revenue.Because loophole beneficiaries do not want to give them up, \u201crevenue neutrality\u201d makes cutting rates much harder. Casting off this constraint and simply lowering rates, said Kevin Hassett, an economist at A.E.I, would cause corporations to rapidly bring overseas jobs home.\u201cIt would really help blue-collar workers,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. \u201cThis is not a Hail Mary. It\u2019s Tom Brady to Randy Moss.\u201dSome Democrats dismiss his enthusiasm \u2014 but not all of them. \u201cAn intriguing proposition,\u201d said Professor Freeman of Harvard.To be sure, replicating America\u2019s postwar gains may prove impossible. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are long passes,\u201d said Robert Reischauer, another former director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cWe\u2019re in a ground game that will take many years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are adjuncts and, if omitted from the menu, should not alter the general harmony of the meal.\u201d I find his wording deeply practical; an hors d\u2019oeuvre shouldn\u2019t be complicated or cast a long shadow. No nonsense, Escoffier cautions.Four slim pages on hors d\u2019oeuvres in \u201cThe Royal Cookery Book,\u201d by the French chef Jules Gouff\u00e9, published in 1869, illustrate Escoffier\u2019s precepts nicely: cold fresh radishes, salted black radishes, green olives, anchovies in oil, cucumber with ravigote, artichokes \u00e0 la poivrade, pickled herring with parsley and capers, pickled oysters with parsley, mixed pickles. Those are all as simple and as good today as they were then, and all demonstrate clear economy, doing a lot for a little.Although they might sound fussy, canap\u00e9s do the same for even less. They\u2019re an especially good way to \u201cmake an hors d\u2019oeuvre fit for a queen on a miller\u2019s budget,\u201d which a friend recently asked me, verbatim, how to do. Escoffier describes canap\u00e9s as \u201cpieces of toast, i.e., slices of bread, trimmed according to fancy, grilled, buttered and garnished in some way.\u201d (\u201cGarnish\u201d is also a word to stumble upon but here simply means something put on top.) I like thinly sliced white bread, toasted and cooled, spread with butter into which chopped shallot has been added, topped with sliced, salted cucumber. Or toast rubbed with a garlic clove and topped with an anchovy. One surprisingly delicious, democratic canap\u00e9 \u2014 good for winter and made famous by the great, wide and opinionated James Beard \u2014 is a tiny sandwich, crusts trimmed, insides spread with mayonnaise, one laid with very finely shaved and well-salted onion. Beard recommends rolling the outer edges in mayonnaise and then in finely chopped parsley, which I have never done but seems messy and fun.At the apex of the whole category, I put the roast oyster, a recipe for which follows. The Romans ate them heartily, as Seneca, Juvenal and Athenaeus all record, and often did so before the main meal began, making oysters in every way a tried-and-true choice. As Harold McGee points out in \u201cOn Food and Cooking,\u201d the contrast between an oyster\u2019s delicacy of flavor and its \u201cencrusted, rocky shell\u201d is a startling delight. Why roast it rather than serve it fresh, untouched but for being pried open? Because though you will sometimes shuck an oyster for yourself, you will rarely, in my experience anyway, ever get to eat a roasted one, unless served it by someone else.In the 19th century, the writer Baron L\u00e9on Brisse complained of the disappearance of hot hors d\u2019oeuvres \u2014 a result, he said, of \u2018'the excessive development of women\u2019s skirts.\u201d I, too, lament the trade-off and agree that there might naturally have been one; a culture can display only so much impractical decorative energy. Today, too, the hot hors d\u2019oeuvre deserves its due. If you don\u2019t have or like oysters, you might fry a spring onion or two a person; or serve a few warm quickly poached shrimp, drizzled with olive oil; or butter-stuffed snails, as in days of yore.I somehow have a strong conviction there should be only one hors d\u2019oeuvre at any given meal. Faced with a selection, I always feel that I have somehow sped through a courtship straight to consummation \u2014 whereas the very point of the hors d\u2019oeuvre is not to speed, but to slow, focusing the minds of eater and cook alike on the pleasure of the meal to follow.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Cheaper Oil Affects Mortgage Rates", "Date": "2014-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMortgagesFalling oil prices typically lead to lower heating bills and cheaper fill-ups at the gasoline pump. Less obvious to the average consumer is the role cheaper oil is playing in driving down mortgage rates.It is a complicated and indirect link that will likely keep rates low well into 2015, economists say.Mortgage rates are largely driven by the bond markets and most closely follow the yields (or rates of return) on United States Treasuries. The Freddie Mac survey noted that the bottoming out of average fixed rates earlier this month followed the lowest yields on 10-year Treasuries since May 2013. So why the decline in yields? The answer, at least in part, has to do with the prolonged slump in oil prices. The price of Brent crude, a benchmark for international prices, which peaked at $115 a barrel in mid-June, has been trading in the $60 range. In general, interest rates tend to be very sensitive to inflation. Because cheaper oil lowers costs throughout the American economy, inflation is pulled downward as well, said Keith Gumbinger, the vice president of HSH.com, a financial publisher. In turn, lower inflation can allow for interest rates in general to decline.That effect has been exacerbated of late by global investors\u2019 concerns about the ailing economies in oil-producing countries, especially Russia. If low oil prices are a boon for consuming nations, they can be detrimental to the economies of producing nations, Mr. Gumbinger said.\u201cMarkets that would normally be pumping oil and getting dollars will get far fewer dollars \u2014 and the prospects for those countries are lower,\u201d he said. The United States, in contrast, with its strong dollar and strengthening economy, looks like a far safer bet for global investors, said Nela Richardson, the chief economist for Redfin, a national real estate brokerage. And many of them are seeking shelter in United States Treasuries. \u201cInvestor demand is chasing that strong dollar into U.S. bonds, and those investors are requiring less yield,\u201d Ms. Richardson said. \u201cAnd as investors require less yield to invest in those bonds, it also decreases mortgage rates.\u201dHow long low oil prices will help support low mortgage rates is anybody\u2019s guess. For one thing, nobody really knows when oil prices will turn around and go the other way, Mr. Gumbinger said. But sustained low-level energy prices also could eventually have a counter effect on interest rates, he said, \u201cby adding hundreds of billions of dollars\u201d to consumer spending. Rates could begin to creep up if the economy continues to strengthen, Ms. Richardson said. \u201cIf firms start hiring again, and wages increase \u2014 that\u2019s when the level of all interest rates in the U.S. would increase,\u201d she said. And then there\u2019s the role of the Federal Reserve. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, recently said that the central bank expects to raise interest rates in 2015, sometime after late April. But Ms. Richardson predicts that global concerns will exert far more influence over interest rates than the Fed, which could mean mortgage rates will stay well below 5 percent for yet another year. The takeaway for home buyers, Ms. Richardson added, is \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of urgency.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spending Bill Hits Snags, but Congress Thinks It Can Avoid Shutdown", "Date": "2014-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress limped Wednesday toward a rare bipartisan agreement on a $1.1 trillion spending bill to keep most of the government operating through next year, but dysfunction once again threatened to derail it. The fissures emerged as lawmakers in both parties balked over details in the 1,600-page bill, including one provision that rolled back Wall Street regulations and could deliver a financial bounty to big banks, and another that would allow big donors to wield even more influence over political parties. More conservative Republicans continued to argue that the bill also did not do enough to try to scale back President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.Even with the resistance, Republican leaders and some Democrats expressed confidence that a government shutdown would be averted. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, who as the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee helped to negotiate a deal, called the spending plan a \u201cmonumental achievement\u201d in an era of seemingly intractable partisan divides.The objections mean that Congress will probably need to pass a short-term funding measure to keep government operations running beyond Thursday \u2014 the current deadline \u2014 while the final disputes are sorted out, even as Republicans expressed confidence that the spending agreement would ultimately be approved.House Speaker John A. Boehner will need Democratic votes to pass the bill, as many of his more conservative members are refusing to support it because of the president\u2019s unilateral decision to defer the deportations of as many as five million undocumented immigrants.But the spending agreement showed signs of friction when Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the minority leader, told her members in a closed-door session that she had called the speaker and signaled that Democrats could have difficulty supporting the final deal if the financial regulation and political contribution provisions were not changed.\u201cThese provisions are destructive to middle-class families and to the practice of our democracy,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. By Wednesday night, Democratic opposition to the bill had hardened over the two provisions. Mr. Boehner told Ms. Pelosi that Republicans were not willing to budge on those issues, said people with knowledge of the discussions, and that if House Democrats were not willing to provide the necessary votes, they should be prepared to vote on a short-term measure that would push the spending package into early next year, when Republicans will have more leverage.Mr. Boehner and his leadership team nonetheless urged Republicans to vote for the bill, saying they would fight Mr. Obama over immigration in February, when the funding for the Department of Homeland Security is scheduled to run out.\u201cWhy in the world would you pick a bar fight three weeks before the end of the year, when your buddies are coming on Jan. 1?\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. The bipartisan package was completed in the aftermath of the midterm elections in November, when Democrats lost their majority in the Senate next year and lost seats in the House as well. In negotiations on the spending bill, Democratic aides said that their chief victories came not from writing new policies into the legislation, but from beating back Republican efforts to dismantle many of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies.Nonetheless, by Wednesday, the outcry from the left was unmistakable, especially over the provision that would roll back a part of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 that limits the ability of big banks to trade certain financial instruments known as swaps \u2014 contracts that allow the banks to hedge their risks or to speculate.Liberal Democrats, including Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, assailed the proposed change. \u201cThis giveaway to Wall Street would open the door to future bailouts funded by American taxpayers,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cIt has been just six years since risky financial practices put our economy on the brink of collapse. This provision, originally written by lobbyists, has no place in a must-pass spending bill.\u201dBut House Republicans, in a summary of the bill, said the provision would help the economy and \u201cprotect farmers and other commodity producers from having to put down excessive collateral to get a loan\u201d or expand their businesses.The legislation also included a rider that would allow big donors to contribute significantly more to national political parties, creating new designated accounts to pay for presidential nominating conventions, legal fees and the cost of buying or renovating office space. Donors could write checks to the new accounts three times as large as the contributions normally allowed to party committees. Initial calculations suggested that the bill would expand the amount that any one person could donate to party committees to more than $777,000 each year from what is now a maximum of $97,200. Neither party\u2019s lawmakers would take responsibility for inserting the provision.\u201cSuccess has many fathers,\u201d said a Republican who supports it, who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity. \u201cDemocrats love this, too.\u201dOther provisions in the bill would stop the Fish and Wildlife Service from listing the sage grouse as an endangered or threatened species; prohibit the government from regulating the lead content of ammunition or fishing tackle; and prevent the Army Corps of Engineers from regulating farm ponds and irrigation ditches under the Clean Water Act.The spending bill would also require the Agriculture Department to include white potatoes among the foods that can be purchased with vouchers in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. White potatoes are excluded from the supplemental food package by a federal rule, but Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine who picked potatoes as a young girl, said the rule was not based on sound science.Another portion of the bill says that no federal or local funds can be used \u201cto enact any law, rule or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use or distribution\u201d of marijuana in the District of Columbia. This would clearly prevent the city from allowing marijuana sales at retail stores or dispensaries like those in Colorado.Before Congress finishes work on the bill, lawmakers said, they also plan to add sweeping changes in pension law that would allow certain multiemployer pension plans to cut benefits of current retirees. Democrats and labor unions are deeply divided over the proposal, which has support from many Republicans.On Wednesday, the House also overwhelming approved legislation extending the federal backstop for terrorism insurance, a major win for developers in Lower Manhattan and other areas considered targets of terrorism attacks. And the big bipartisan vote came despite the Republican addition of a different provision rolling back regulations in the Dodd-Frank law. That vote will make it much more difficult for the Senate to oppose the measure, even though Senate Democrats and the Obama administration opposed inclusion of the regulatory rollback.Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting from Washington, and Nicholas Confessore from New York.Advertisement"}

That is especially true in the media industry, where a bad stretch of advertising and extensive challenges to existing business models have clobbered many legacy outfits.Now that the economic cycle is no longer creating such stiff headwinds, though, excuses will be tough to come by. Next year will not only be a period of continued disruption, but a reckoning as well.Certain new realities are beyond argument: Clutter is up \u2014 more ads, more channels, more content \u2014 advertising rates continue to drop, and audiences are programming their own universe in text, video and audio. Consumers don\u2019t want to watch commercials, are fleeing networks, hate reruns, are increasingly bored by reality programming, shun print products and, oh, by the way, don\u2019t want to pay much for content either.Yikes.Here at Media Equation H.Q. \u2014 which actually consists of me, my cube and some bobble heads \u2014 we thought now might be a good time to take stock of companies, businesses and executives who have much to worry about in the coming year.Here, then, is the Hot Seat list for 2015.ANYONE RUNNING A MOVIE STUDIO OR A THEATER CHAIN Never mind hacking, who stole all those moviegoers? Ticket sales at the box office fell 4 percent this year versus last year, and in the first nine months, profits at Regal Entertainment, the No. 1 theater chain, were down 50 percent compared with the previous year. More worrisome still, the Nielsen Company said last week that movie attendance for Americans ages 12 to 24 dropped 15 percent in the first nine months of 2014, compared with the same period a year earlier.Movies have become a tent-pole business, meaning that they are dependent on blockbusters garnering huge domestic and international box office sales that mint franchises the studios can ride for years. If young people \u2014 a critical demographic \u2014 are too busy cocooning with their little screens or looking at bigger and bigger ones at home, it\u2019s going to make that corner office on the studio lot feel like a sauna.PHIL GRIFFIN, PRESIDENT OF MSNBCThose familiar with television news will tell you that Mr. Griffin is one of the smartest people around, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from MSNBC\u2019s ratings. Stalwarts of the liberal-leaning channel \u2014 \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d and \u201cMorning Joe\u201d \u2014 are posting some of their lowest ratings ever and some of the fixes that Mr. Griffin has come up with \u2014 Ronan Farrow, anyone? \u2014 went nowhere.Cable news outfits are always compared with Fox News, but that channel is in its own business, which involves grilling and serving red meat to devoted conservatives. With a Democratic president viewed by many as disappointing, and control of both houses belonging to Republicans, liberals are less interested in tuning in to chronic outrage. It\u2019s been said that television news is a business where elections, in the form of ratings, are held every night, and by that measure, MSNBC is losing its base. Eventually, attention will focus on both the overall approach and the leader of the ticket.PHILIPPE DAUMAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF VIACOMNickelodeon, which produces about half of the company\u2019s profits, has been in a pronounced slide, and Comedy Central will have to reboot part of its nightly programming now that Stephen Colbert is headed to CBS. I\u2019m not the only skeptic: Disney\u2019s stock is up almost 25 percent on the year, while Viacom\u2019s dropped 11.75 percent. Sumner Redstone, the chairman of the company and controlling shareholder, is 91 years old and no clear succession is in place, so it\u2019s hard to know exactly where the pressure will come from. But by any objective standard, Mr. Dauman is up against some brutal realities in an increasingly Darwinian cable world.DEBORAH TURNESS, PRESIDENT OF NBC NEWSMARK THOMPSON, CHIEF OF THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANYDigital and print news providers face crushing pressure from so-called programmatic sales, which lowers the yield on advertising; the switch to mobile, which is harder to make money from; and the rise of platforms like Facebook, which compete for readers interested in keeping up with the news.Although The Times\u2019s metered model opened up a new source of revenue \u2014 there are now 875,000 digital-only subscribers \u2014 new lower-cost online-subscription approaches like NYT Now have not taken off as hoped. Mr. Thompson has the full confidence of the company\u2019s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., but declines in print advertising and circulation have created holes in revenue that a recent round of buyouts and layoffs can\u2019t begin to fill. That very tough math will be squarely on Mr. Thompson\u2019s desk in the coming year.JOSEPH RIPP, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF TIME INC.After being cut loose by Time Warner last year, the new publicly traded Time Inc. announced a flurry of digital initiatives and lots of restructuring. But since the spinoff, Time Inc. has lost senior executives, the flagship People brand continues to struggle and talk of acquisitions seems far-fetched. Mr. Ripp puts a brave face on it, pointing to increased digital ad sales, but it becomes more obvious with each passing day that Time Inc., once a symbol of New York publishing might, will probably not continue as a stand-alone magazine company. Look for Mr. Ripp to cut a deal with Meredith next year that will scan as a merger, but is really a sale.AND THE RESTThere is a big list of people and companies that may not be on the hot seat in the calendar year, but who will still be rowing upstream. After some wins with \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d Netflix stumbled with \u201cMarco Polo,\u201d an expansive, expensive series that fell flat. With Amazon and others increasingly in the picture, it will take lots of new programming and new hits to stay ahead of the crowd. ... Unless something world-changing is underway, live news is not working on CNN as it once did, and Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, has yet to crack the code on programming that will help the network escape the tyranny of the news cycle. ... Marissa Mayer has many other problems at Yahoo, but her big foray into news and information looks like a bust. The high-level talent hired as part of the initiative seems to be in witness protection, and analysts are openly discussing a merger with AOL, another longtime behemoth with some identity issues. ... David Cohen, Comcast\u2019s executive vice president and Beltway ambassador, put a great deal of shoulder and rhetoric in pushing through the merger with Time Warner Cable. But what looked like a fait accompli now seems much less so.Keep in mind I could be wrong about a lot of this speculation, and if I am, my own chair may heat up a bit. In an increasingly fraught environment, no one in media-land can expect to live a life beyond consequence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airlines Use Fuel Windfall to Pursue Premium Flier", "Date": "2014-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the RoadI HAVE occasionally suggested here that business travelers on exhausting international trips ought to be able to fly in the comfort of business class, or at least in premium-economy cabins with more legroom and better service than in the squalor of coach. This suggestion irritates some frugal corporate travel managers.Airlines, on the other hand, love to hear this. Around the world, as they accumulate record profits and hail the sharp drop in oil prices, airlines are spending billions to make their premium-cabin products \u2014 chiefly business class, but also first class \u2014 more attractive to corporate travelers. There seems to be an assumption that lower energy prices generally are putting more disposable income into travelers\u2019 pockets, while loosening up some corporate policies on flying in premium classes.\u201cWe have seen a really big increase in business-class travel,\u201d said Peter Vlitas, the senior vice president for airline sales and marketing at Protravel International, a travel management company.The improving economy is a reason, as well as that more people are traveling internationally, often on longer multicity trips. \u201cThey might be going from the U.S. into London, but coming back out of Paris after a side trip to Germany,\u201d he said.Six or seven years ago, a typical last-minute business-class round-trip fare from New York to London was about $11,000. Now, with abundant capacity and robust competition, those fares are generally $6,500 to $7,000, and travel agents can negotiate lower prices for big corporate buyers.The top argument for allowing business class is productivity. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking going to Europe in a coach seat, they arrive at six or seven in the morning and are expected to start work right away,\u201d Mr. Vlitas said. \u201cThen we see in our surveys that they tend to be pretty good till maybe 11 in the morning, but after that they hit a brick wall.\u201dSome companies that do approve business-class travel do so only in one direction, however. \u201cTo save money, the company might send them over in business class, and then on the way back home put them in a premium-economy seat,\u201d he said.Customer segmentation is a fancy way of saying, We don\u2019t want to compete for basic market share; we have little interest in growing capacity; and we\u2019ll concentrate on the highest-revenue producers, especially those sitting in the front of the plane. It seems that airlines also expect to see more of what one analyst at the Delta conference said was a \u201cwindfall\u201d in consumer wealth created by lower energy prices.Glen Hauenstein, Delta\u2019s chief revenue officer, was running with the theme last week.\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to think about not only what lower fuel prices does to the airline, but what it does to the consumer and what they intend to do with their savings from lower fuel prices,\u201d Mr. Hauenstein said at the conference. Delta is forecasting a profit of $5 billion next year, buttressed by an estimated $1.5 billion savings on fuel.Younger travelers especially are open to buying higher-end travel, Mr. Hauenstein told the analysts.\u201cIf we think about what the millennials are doing, and what people are generally doing, you don\u2019t see them buying T-shirts. You don\u2019t see them running to the malls; you don\u2019t see them buying short-term goods. You don\u2019t see them buying durable goods. Millennials want experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are they spending money on? They\u2019re spending it on entertainment and travel.\u201d\u201cNot only have they caught up with the other premium carriers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they are now leading the charge.\u201dEmail: jsharkey@nytimes.com Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Move Over Land Yachts, Compact S.U.V.s Are in Demand", "Date": "2014-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsSusan Mahoney has for years owned a string of sport utility vehicles \u2014 land yachts that gave her plenty of room and a commanding view, along with a big fuel bill. But when her husband died this year, she realized she no longer needed, or wanted, such a cavernous vehicle.So like thousands of other car buyers this year, Ms. Mahoney, 58, settled on a Buick Encore, one of a new type of small S.U.V.s. that offer the size of a compact car with the amenities of the larger sport utilities she used to drive, like the Chevy Blazer, and, most recently, her three-row Buick Enclave.\u201cThis is definitely the smallest vehicle I\u2019ve ever had, but it\u2019s perfect,\u201d said Ms. Mahoney, who lives in Gilbert, Ariz., outside Phoenix. \u201cThere\u2019s just enough room to haul groceries around, and now instead of filling up the tank once a week, I\u2019m at the gas station maybe every two weeks.\u201dCall it the year of the shrinking S.U.V.Ms. Mahoney and consumers like her are flocking to pint-size S.U.V.s, fueling a boom in vehicles that handle like a car, get the mileage of a midsize sedan, and yet offer the flexible storage and high vantage point many drivers want. It has turned smaller sport utility vehicles into one of the hottest segments of the roaring auto industry.Consumer interest in the segment began slowly when Toyota introduced the RAV4 \u2014 the first so-called compact S.U.V. \u2014 in the mid-1990s, a time when huge, truck-based sport utilities were in their heyday. But over the last decade, the segment has surged; now, nearly every automaker produces its own version of a small crossover, as they race to meet the demand.This year, as American auto sales as a whole grew by 5.5 percent, small S.U.V.s accounted for nearly a third of that growth, according to Edmunds.Sales of the RAV4, for example, rose 24 percent this year through November compared with 2013, according to the Autodata Corporation. Honda\u2019s best-selling CR-V was up 10 percent. Nissan\u2019s Rogue was up 25 percent. And the new Jeep Cherokee exploded out of the gate its first year, selling 160,000 through November.But if small is good, perhaps smaller still is even better \u2014 or so the thinking now goes among automakers, setting off a new race to create even more petite offerings.In addition to the Encore, whose sales surged 72 percent in November over the previous year, the Nissan Juke and Mitsubishi Outlander Sport are already vying for a slice of the tiny-S.U.V. pie. And more competitors are poised to enter the game as Honda, Jeep and others plan to introduce smaller sport utilities next year.Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst with Edmunds, said that price was another selling point for the smallest S.U.V.s. \u201cWe\u2019re now talking about true entry-level buyers having choices they never had before,\u201d she said.This month, Chevrolet began shipping its long-awaited Trax subcompact, aimed at urban, budget-conscious S.U.V. shoppers. Its price tag starts at just over $20,000.\u201cThis is about as small as an S.U.V. can get,\u201d said Steve Majoros, Chevy\u2019s crossover marketing director. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to climb a mountain, but is has still many of the benefits people look for from a traditional sport utility.\u201dChevy has deemed it the \u201ccity smart S.U.V.\u201d and while it will take until February for them to fully arrive at dealerships around the country, some dealers in Western states have already started to sell them.Terry Hoisington, general manager of Henderson Chevrolet, outside Las Vegas, said the first Trax that showed up at his lot this month wound up selling before the end of the day. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great option for people that we\u2019ve needed for a while but never had, and the price is very attractive for our customers,\u201d Mr. Hoisington said.He said the boost in fuel economy was also attractive, despite the recent plunge in gasoline prices.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about budget-conscious folks where fuel is always on people\u2019s mind,\u201d Mr. Hoisington said. \u201cIf you\u2019re on a tight budget each month, you\u2019re not going to buy a big truck just because gas is cheap. You want something that saves you money for the long run.\u201dThe Trax gets a combined 29 miles a gallon. Ms. Mahoney\u2019s Buick Encore gets nearly the same, at 28 miles a gallon.Even automakers that have long been purely focused on capability have gotten into the downsizing act. Chrysler\u2019s Jeep brand began selling its new Cherokee compact S.U.V. last October, and so far this year it has sold nearly as well as its bigger brother, the Grand Cherokee \u2014 helping to power Jeep to record sales.Michael Manley, president and chief executive of the Jeep division, said innovations developed over the last several years \u2014 like nine-speed transmissions \u2014 allowed the company\u2019s engineers to design a smaller S.U.V. that is more comfortable and compact, without losing too much of the dexterity that Jeep is known for.\u201cIn years past, there was no technology available to be able to combine the capability we needed with the handling and fuel economy competitors offered, without compromising that capability,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that\u2019s no longer the case.\u201dAnd next year Jeep will introduce an even smaller S.U.V., the Renegade. How small will it be by comparison? It shares the same platform as the elfin Fiat 500L, which is more than two feet shorter than a Grand Cherokee.For Ms. Mahoney, she says her Encore gives her just enough room, without losing the essence of what she likes.\u201cIt\u2019s just me now, what do I need all that extra space for?\u201d she said. \u201cBut I really didn\u2019t want to drive a sedan, and now I don\u2019t have to.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The problem is that for illuminating answers, you need to ask the right questions.Last Sunday, for example, the National Retail Federation, a trade association, released its annual survey of holiday shopping. As usual, it was heavily covered.\u201cThat\u2019s not an area we\u2019ve ever gotten into,\u201d said Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the federation, when I asked her about it last week. The federation has traditionally avoided touchy subjects, leaving it up to the retail chains in its membership to talk about them if they so choose. And last week, the big chains generally weren\u2019t saying much about the boycott.I asked some of the boycott organizers how effective they thought they had been. They were able to provide detailed information about their roles in promoting the protests on social media but had no data about the effects of their efforts on retailers.\u201cThe power structure isn\u2019t listening to us in the streets or in the courts, so we are going to have to do it with our buying power,\u201d she said in an interview. With a new hashtag, #BlackDecember, she is calling for people to buy from black-owned businesses.Separately, a Los Angeles-based network called the Blackout for Human Rights used the hashtag #BlackoutBlackFriday on Twitter in early November, according to Michael Latt, a spokesman for the group. The group decided to include a Black Friday boycott in its protests \u201cbecause America speaks the language of money, and that\u2019s something that everybody can understand,\u201d Mr. Latt said. But he and Ms. Tesfamariam said that they had not tried to come up with any numbers that might prove they were having an economic impact.The questions in this year\u2019s survey were decided on Nov. 17, Ms. Grannis said, before the grand jury decision in the Ferguson case. In any event, no questions about social unrest have ever been included in the survey. \u201cIt\u2019s just an estimate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our best shot.\u201dOther data providers have come up with varying numbers, generally pointing to a decline in bricks-and-mortar sales, along with an increase in online sales, at the start of the shopping season.At this point, I don\u2019t know either. But the question certainly seems worth asking.The Strategies column last Sunday, about how holiday retail sales may have been affected by recent demonstrations against racial injustice, referred incorrectly to the death of Eric Garner after a confrontation with the police on Staten Island. He died after being placed in a chokehold; he did not die in a shooting.Advertisement"}

Ms. Dunne has criticized the government and the continued provision of American military aid, but she also criticized previous governments. There is much to criticize. Mr. Sisi overthrew Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi; crushed the Muslim Brotherhood that supported Mr. Morsi; imprisoned countless liberals and secularists; cracked down on journalists and nongovernmental groups; and presided over a judiciary that sentenced hundreds of Brotherhood members to death after show trials while throwing out a murder case against the former dictator Hosni Mubarak. Regrettably, Congress is giving Mr. Sisi no serious reason to reconsider his methods of governing, which are even more authoritarian than Mr. Mubarak\u2019s, or to see the annual $1.3 billion in American military aid as anything other than an entitlement. He does not pretend to care about American concerns.Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, tried but failed to reduce Egypt\u2019s annual military entitlement in the omnibus spending bill approved by Congress on Saturday. As was true of last year\u2019s spending bill, the measure requires Secretary of State John Kerry to certify that Egypt is moving on a democratic path.It added further conditions, specifying that Egypt hold free and fair parliamentary elections and provide detainees with due process of law. It also requires Mr. Kerry to consult with Congress on restructuring aid to Egypt, including the cash flow finance system (enjoyed only by Israel and Egypt) that works like a credit card. But perhaps fatally for the cause of reform, the bill \u2014 reflecting strong lobbying by the American defense industry that provides most of Egypt\u2019s military equipment \u2014 allows the administration to waive those conditions in the interests of national security.The waiver gives Mr. Kerry an opening to continue rewarding the Egyptian government for bad behavior. He should not invoke it. He should agree to restructure the aid package eventually to eliminate cash flow finance. Egypt is an important partner in Middle East peace and the fight against extremists, but it does not serve American interests to funnel aid, without question or account, to a government that is ruthless and self-destructive \u2014 a government whose treatment of people like Ms. Dunne will discourage the tourism and development Mr. Sisi needs to revive his country\u2019s economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Costly and Outrageous Tax Break", "Date": "2014-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 INDIVIDUAL taxpayers aren\u2019t supposed to claim shady deductions on their taxes. But between 2008 and 2013, Congress allowed many business owners to do just that. This year congressional Republicans have tried to make this audacious dishonesty permanent, and a number of Democrats have gone along.This license to steal goes by the sunny moniker \u201cbonus depreciation.\u201d Shorn of its mind-numbing complexity, bonus depreciation allows a business to pretend that its buildings and equipment wear out far faster than they actually do. Even without bonus depreciation, businesses routinely receive large deductions for their capital investments long before they have used up those investments \u2014 and often before they have even finished paying for them. Republican senators nonetheless insisted on including, in the 2008 fiscal stimulus, a huge extra, or bonus, deduction for businesses in the year they make a capital expenditure. The idea was to give businesses an incentive to accelerate their capital spending, putting more money into the economy when it was most needed. The deductions allowed can easily be greater than what the business actually spent on the investment that year.The bonus-depreciation provision expired at the end of 2013, after several extensions. House Republicans, however, are fighting to revive it retroactively for the 2014 tax year and make it permanent. This makes no sense.By definition, retroactive tax cuts provide no incentive at all. Reasonable people can differ over lowering rates of taxation on income, honestly calculated; allowing one set of affluent entities to misstate their incomes encourages cynicism. And why should we artificially favor spending on capital assets over spending on employee salaries?The cost would be staggering: nearly $300 billion over the next decade, more than three times what we spend on nutrition supplements for pregnant women, infants and young children. That would wipe out roughly one-third of the deficit reduction from higher tax collections from the wealthy as a result of last year\u2019s \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d deal. As economic stimulus, bonus depreciation does not work. Studies of a similar measure enacted to combat the 2001 recession found that only a tiny minority of businesses even considered the new tax benefit as an important factor in making investment decisions. A recent Bloomberg BNA survey found that 83 percent of top tax and accounting executives reported that the timing of the expiration of bonus depreciation did not have a significant impact on their companies\u2019 expenditures. President George W. Bush and his Republican Congress, who were hardly shy about granting expensive tax breaks to business, allowed bonus depreciation to expire in 2004.Perhaps worst of all, it breaks the agreement in 2009 that deficit increases to stimulate the economy would be temporary. When the expiration dates for the Democrats\u2019 programs arrived, the spending stopped. Spending on aid to state jobs programs and teacher hiring ended on time, even though the economy was still deeply depressed; local school districts cut 324,000 jobs. Congress extended unemployment benefits for a while but then allowed them to end. It even accelerated the expiration of the stimulus package\u2019s temporary food assistance benefits.Europe\u2019s dogged pursuit of austerity has left it mired in the doldrums. Recent reports from Japan and even China suggest serious economic weakness. Although recessions in other major economies do not guarantee a recession here, they would at a minimum dry up demand for our exports. That would make strong domestic demand even more important and a prompt, strong bipartisan response to any signs of recession all the more critical. The Democrats did their part in allowing temporary spending increases to lapse; it is the Republicans\u2019 turn to show their good faith by accepting the end of bonus depreciation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Economic Unknowns of 2015, From Unemployment to Oil", "Date": "2014-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewI wish I knew where the economy will be heading next year. If I did, I might become rich. But, alas, I don\u2019t \u2014 and even if we don\u2019t always acknowledge it, no economists do.Too much uncertainty clouds the crystal ball to be confident that any particular course of events will play out in the real world. But we do know something about the sources of that uncertainty, and in a season for sharing, I\u2019d like to offer six questions whose eventual resolution will shape the economic year ahead:The unemployment rate stands at 5.8 percent. If it continues on its current trajectory, it will have fallen an additional half a percentage point by mid-2015, putting it at a level that some economists see as effectively full employment.Higher interest rates could slow the economy. That leads to my third question:Typically, an oil price decline is like a tax cut, leaving more money in consumers\u2019 pockets to spend elsewhere. That should spur growth. But since the shale boom, the United States is not only a leading oil consumer but also a leading producer. So lower oil prices also spell smaller revenue for some of our energy companies. And our producers have particularly high costs, so further investment in them may become unprofitable if prices fall too far.This leads us back to the inherent uncertainty afflicting economics:I wish I could offer clearer guidance about next year, but an honest account focuses on the limits of our knowledge. We\u2019re not sure how much further the economy can improve next year, or even if it will actually do so, and we don\u2019t know what might drive it off course. So instead of a forecast, I\u2019ll offer advice: Prepare for the worst, hope for the best and count on being surprised.JUSTIN WOLFERS is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.

Dr. Horvitz and his wife, Mary Horvitz, agreed to fund the initiative, called the \u201cOne Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence.\u201dIn an interview, Dr. Horvitz said he was unconvinced by recent warnings that superintelligent machines were poised to outstrip human control and abilities. Instead, he believes these technologies will have positive and negative effects on society.\u201cLoss of control of A.I. systems has become a big concern,\u201d he said. \u201cIt scares people.\u201d Rather than simply dismiss these dystopian claims, he said, scientists instead must monitor and continually evaluate the technologies.\u201cEven if the anxieties are unwarranted, they need to be addressed,\u201d Dr. Horvitz said.He declined to divulge the size of his gift to Stanford, but said it was sufficient to fund the study for a century and suggested the amount might be increased in the future.Dr. Horvitz will lead a committee with Russ Altman, a Stanford professor of bioengineering and computer science. The committee will include Barbara J. Grosz, a Harvard University computer scientist; Deirdre K. Mulligan, a lawyer and a professor in the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley; Yoav Shoham, a professor of computer science at Stanford; Tom Mitchell, the chairman of the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University; and Alan Mackworth, a professor of computer science at the University of British Columbia.Dr. Horvitz said that progress in the field of artificial intelligence had consistently been overestimated.Indeed, news accounts in 1958 described a neural network circuit designed by Frank Rosenblatt, a psychologist at Cornell University. The Navy enthusiastically announced plans to build a \u201cthinking machine\u201d based on the circuits within a year for $100,000. It never happened.Still, Dr. Horvitz acknowledged, the pace of technological change has accelerated, as has the reach of artificial intelligence. He cited Stuxnet, the malicious program developed by intelligence agencies to attack Iranian nuclear facilities, as an example.\u201cMy grandmother would tell me stories about people running outside when they saw a plane fly over, it was so unusual,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, in a relatively few decades, our worry is about whether we are getting a salt-free meal when we take off from J.F.K. in a jumbo jet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Waitress, Your Professor", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 ON the first day of the fall semester, I left campus from an afternoon of teaching anxious college freshmen and headed to my second job, serving at a chain restaurant off Las Vegas Boulevard. The switch from my professional attire to a white dress shirt, black apron and tie reflected the separation I attempt to maintain between my two jobs. Naturally, sitting at the first table in my section was one of my new students, dining with her parents.This scene is a clich\u00e9 of the struggling teacher, and it surfaces repeatedly in pop culture \u2014 think of Walter White in \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d washing the wheels of a student\u2019s sports car after a full day teaching high school chemistry. Bumping into a student at the gym can be awkward, but exposing the reality that I, with my master\u2019s degree, not only have another job, but must have one, risks destroying the facade of success I present to my students as one of their university mentors.In class I emphasize the value of a degree as a means to avoid the sort of jobs that I myself go to when those hours in the classroom are over. A colleague in my department labeled these jobs (food and beverage, retail and customer service \u2014 the only legal work in abundance in Las Vegas) as \u201csurvival jobs.\u201d He tells our students they need to learn that survival work will not grant them the economic security of white-collar careers. I never told him that I myself had such a job, that I needed our meeting to end within the next 10 minutes or I\u2019d be late to a seven-hour shift serving drunk, needy tourists, worsening my premature back problem while getting hit on repeatedly.The line between these two worlds is thinner here in Las Vegas than it might be elsewhere. The majority of my students this semester hold part-time survival jobs, and some of them will remain in those jobs for the rest of their working lives. About 60 percent of the college freshmen I teach will not finish their degree. They will turn 21 and then forgo a bachelor\u2019s degree for the instant gratification of a cash-based income, whether parking cars in Vegas hotels, serving in high-end restaurants or dealing cards in the casinos. In a city like Las Vegas, many customer-service jobs generate far more cash (with fewer work hours) than entry-level, office-dwelling, degree-requiring jobs. It can be hard to convince my 19-year-old students that the latter is more profitable or of greater personal value. My adjunct-teaching colleagues have large course loads and, mostly, graduate-level educations, but live just above the poverty line. In contrast, my part-time work in the Vegas service industry has produced three times more income than my university teaching. (I\u2019ve passed up the health benefits that come with full-time teaching, a luxury foreign to the majority of adjuncts at other universities, to make time for my blue-collar work.) Indeed, for a young academic like myself, the job market is bleak. I\u2019m pursuing advanced degrees and a career in the academy despite the lack of employment prospects, because my first and true love is learning. However, it will take earning a doctorate \u2014 and thus several more years of work \u2014 before I can earn a sustainable income in my chosen pursuit.Living these two supposedly different lives, I\u2019ve started to see their similarities. Whenever I\u2019m trying to meet the needs of my more difficult guests (\u201cDo you have any smaller forks?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t carry wheat bread? What kind of restaurant doesn\u2019t carry wheat bread?\u201d), I recite, along with my colleagues, the collective restaurant server mantra: \u201cI need a real job.\u201d The same thought gets passed among adjuncts in my department: \u201cI need a real teaching position. I need to publish a book.\u201dI know this path takes time, and I\u2019m trying to do it right. So why do I still experience a great feeling of shame when clearing a student\u2019s dirty plate? Embarrassment is not an adequate term to describe what I felt when those parents looked at me, clearly stupefied, thinking, \u201cThis waitress teaches my child?\u201dIt is a shame I share with many of my blue-collar colleagues, a belief that society deems our work inferior, that we have settled on or chosen these paths because we do not have the skills necessary to acquire something better. It is certainly a belief I held for the majority of my undergraduate experience.But not all my restaurant co-workers are college dropouts, and none are failures. Many have bachelor\u2019s degrees; others have real estate licenses, freelancing projects or extraordinary musical and artistic abilities. Others are nontraditional students, having entered the work force before attending college and making the wise decision not to \u201cfind themselves\u201d and come out with $40,000 in debt, at 4.6 percent interest. Most of them are parents who have bought homes, raised children and made financial investments off their modest incomes. They are some of the kindest, hardest-working people I know, and after three years alongside them, I find it difficult to tell my students to avoid being like them.My perhaps na\u00efve hope is that when I tell students I\u2019m not only an academic, but a \u201csurvival\u201d jobholder, I\u2019ll make a dent in the artificial, inaccurate division society places between blue-collar work and \u201cintelligent\u201d work. We expect our teachers to teach us, not our servers, although in the current economy, these might be the same people.If my students can imagine the possibility that choosing to work with their hands does not automatically exclude them from being people who critically examine the world around them, I will feel I\u2019ve done something worthwhile, not only for those who will earn their degree, but for the majority who will not.Brittany Bronson is an English instructor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

{"Headline": "When Regulators Are Blind to Rules", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceWhat happens when you turn over regulatory responsibilities to people who think there is really no need for regulation?The United States, and much of the world, tried that for a large part of the last quarter-century. Along the way, a series of crises sent out warning signals that were not heeded.After the economy recovered from the stock market crash of 1987, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman who had poured money into the market to stem the damage, was celebrated as a hero. He believed in what came to be derided as \u201cmarket fundamentalism,\u201d holding that markets were far smarter than governments and would produce optimal results if only there were no interference from politicians.That analysis certainly seemed reasonable through much of the 1990s. The economy grew without a recession for 10 years, the longest such stretch in United States history. A few people worried that bad things could happen as a result of the explosive growth in derivative securities, but they were largely marginalized by the obvious fact that only good things were happening.That was exactly what was happening in the late 1990s, but Mr. Greenspan saw no reason to be concerned about rapidly rising asset prices. Was it not clear that markets were efficient?Starting in 1997, a series of crises appeared to be unrelated. Each was viewed as an extraordinary event.It went largely unnoticed that those crises had something in common: destabilizing factors caused by financial innovation and the lack of regulation.That was true in Asia, where countries had followed the advice of groups like the International Monetary Fund and done nothing to control huge flows of capital into their economies. When the news turned bad, that capital tried to flee. Currencies collapsed and bailouts ensued. Then came the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund. It had used too much leverage as it traded derivative securities with strategies that assumed some market relationships were sure things. The Fed had to step in to persuade \u2014 some might say force \u2014 the big banks to bail out the fund.As share prices rose in the 1990s, many concluded that the stock market was a sure thing, at least in the long run. A book called \u201cDow 36,000\u201d became a best seller. People quit good jobs to join start-ups, hoping that stock options would make them rich when their new employer went public. Silicon Valley won a bitter battle to keep company books from having to reflect the real value of the options being handed out, arguing in essence that the party might end if that happened.Executives at more than a few companies \u2014 Enron and WorldCom being the most notable \u2014 cooked the books to allow themselves to share in the riches.When share prices of high-flying technology and telecommunications companies collapsed in 2000 and 2001, the scandals led to passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley law, which for the first time created a regulator to pay attention to the auditors, whose work had been woefully inadequate. Wall Street analysts faced new rules on the theory that they had promoted stocks they knew were worthless.But few wanted to mess with the financial engineers. Instead, their standing only grew. Bank capital rules came to allow the banks to use their own \u2014 presumably sophisticated \u2014 models to calculate how much capital was needed for any asset they owned. Countries like Ireland and Iceland developed large banking systems and were hailed for finding high-paying, nonpolluting jobs.But did that mean Washington needed to act? Far from it. \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Mr. Summers said in a speech to the Futures Industry Association. \u201cIt is the private sector, not the public sector, that is in the best position to provide effective supervision. Market discipline is the first line of defense in maintaining the integrity of our financial system.\u201dAnd it was to be the only line. Later that year, with bipartisan support, Congress passed, and President Bill Clinton signed, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. That act barred the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives.Had there been such regulation, it is at least possible that the financial crisis might have been less severe than it was. To a significant extent, derivatives enabled risk to be shifted from those who understood it to those who did not. Securities deemed risk-free by the rating agencies turned out to be worthless. Much of the financial innovation that so impressed Mr. Greenspan had been designed to let banks find ways to reduce their capital levels without the regulators noticing.\u201cI hear about these wonderful innovations in the financial markets and they sure as hell need a lot of innovation,\u201d Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman, said in late 2009. He said two of them \u2014 credit-default swaps and collateralized debt obligations \u2014 had nearly destroyed the economy.\u201cThe most important financial innovation that I have seen the past 20 years,\u201d he added, \u201cis the automated teller machine.\u201dThere is still good reason to think that markets are better at allocating capital than are governments. But if the events leading up to the financial crisis proved anything, it is that markets freed of meaningful oversight did a horrible job. After the crisis, financial regulation was stepped up around the world. Significantly, the countries that seem to have been the most vigilant in raising bank capital standards are the United States, Britain and Switzerland. They are the countries that have the biggest financial sectors \u2014 and thus the most to lose if their banks again teeter on the brink of collapse.Perhaps the standard Walter Lippman set in 1933 \u2014 that a good crisis is one that leads to solutions of the problems that caused the crisis \u2014 was met. But the new reforms have not been tested. It could be that the test is beginning in Russia, where the ruble has collapsed to the point that Russian merchants are reluctant to accept it. Capital is fleeing, and Russia appears to be hesitant to use its vaunted foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. The government says it will not impose capital controls, but such promises only serve to increase fears they will be broken.In the 1960s, when exchange rates were fixed \u2014 at least until a crisis forced action \u2014 there was a saying: \u201cHe lied like a finance minister on the eve of devaluation.\u201dThe important issue for the world\u2019s financial system is the extent to which the crisis can be contained. Russian companies owe a lot of euros and dollars, and the lenders \u2014 banks and bondholders \u2014 could suffer substantial losses. Such losses could force them to sell other assets, spreading the crisis. Already stock markets and currencies in other emerging markets are losing value, reflecting the fear of contagion. We can hope that Western banks really do have enough capital cushion to weather any storm that may develop.In normal times, a country in trouble can turn to the I.M.F. for a bailout, albeit one with strings. Russia probably cannot do that on terms it would be willing to accept, given Western anger over its actions in Ukraine. Indeed, wags are already suggesting a title for a book to be written about the crisis: \u201cCrimean Punishment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Phoenix Rediscovers Historic Face Worth Saving", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Michelle Dodds bounded through a downtown that to the untrained eye seemed to be dominated by gleaming skyscrapers and sports arenas, the kind of shimmering modern structures that lend credence to the stereotype of this being a young city devoid of history.But Ms. Dodds, the city\u2019s historic preservation officer, knows better.On this day, she pointed out the old City Hall, where the police interrogation of Ernesto Miranda in 1963 led to the landmark Supreme Court decision requiring officers to inform criminal suspects of their rights. A few blocks away was Barrister Place, where Alfred Hitchcock filmed the opening scene of \u201cPsycho.\u201dMs. Dodds could also spot the ghosts of downtown: the buildings that no longer stood and the decrepit spaces long past their glory. Too often, she said, the structures were lost because the case for preservation was unpersuasive, or because too few people knew of their significance.\u201cYou can\u2019t win everything,\u201d said Ms. Dodds, a longtime city employee who, in three years at her current job, has become a student and defender of Phoenix\u2019s history. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everything. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u201cWe need to do a better job of being proactive and making people aware,\u201d Ms. Dodds said. \u201cOur office spends a lot of time reacting to things \u2014 demolitions, or someone doing something to a building. To a certain extent, that will always be true.\u201dOne problem is that the funding for most of the city\u2019s preservation efforts is nearing depletion. In 2006, voters approved a $13.1 million bond issue to pay for grants to property owners who say they will restore historic buildings. Less than $1 million is left. \u201cWe\u2019re driving on fumes right now,\u201d said Mark Briggs, a lawyer and member of the city\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission.A century ago, Phoenix was a frontier outpost in the northern Sonoran Desert that had only recently become the capital of the new state of Arizona. It had just over 11,000 residents. By 1940, that figure had climbed to about 65,000.\u201cPhoenix was just so intent on building a name for itself and being seen as something new and different, it didn\u2019t see a need to preserve the old examples,\u201d said Jennifer Boucek, director of Preserve Phoenix, a nonprofit.That many of the buildings under threat are not all that old \u2014 they are mainly midcentury modern structures, often built after 1950 \u2014 has complicated recent efforts. \u201cHistoric?\u201d Ms. Dodds said, repeating the common reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s younger than I am!\u201dBut lately, there has been a reconsideration of the changing face of downtown. For one thing, the economic downturn stalled the type of major developments that had threatened historic sites. But it is more than that: The millennial generation has drifted back to the city\u2019s core and has shown an attachment to older buildings. And the generation behind the city\u2019s explosive growth is starting to reconsider its legacy.\u201cIt\u2019s insane what has been lost,\u201d said Will Novak, president of the Phoenix Historic Neighborhoods Coalition. \u201cIf you don\u2019t respect your own history \u2014 if you don\u2019t value your city \u2014 how is anyone supposed to value it?\u201dAs Ms. Dodds gave a tour of downtown, she noted positive signs: The Gold Spot, a building that was nearly demolished several times, has become a gathering place \u2014 complete with a hip coffee shop \u2014 in the Roosevelt Row Arts District, known as \u201cRoRo.\u201d And a warehouse district in the shadow of downtown that was once dead is now growing.Dudley Ventures, a financial services company, was among the first to arrive in the warehouse district, leaving behind a traditional office for an old supply store that had been neglected for years. When it bought the building five years ago, the company was practically the only business around. Renovating a 10,000-square-foot space that had no air conditioning and limited plumbing was tougher than its executives had imagined.\u201cWe were just fortunate that it worked out,\u201d said James D.

{"Headline": "Rapprochement With Russia?", "Date": "2014-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe ruble\u2019s dramatic decline threatens to plunge Russia into a full-scale economic crisis. President Vladimir Putin has attempted to minimize the difficulties and deflect blame toward the West, but the problem is serious and no one is to blame but Mr. Putin himself. His efforts to destabilize Ukraine have brought painful sanctions upon Russia, reinforced its dependence on oil and isolated its economy.Yet Russia\u2019s crisis holds both risk and opportunity. The risk is that an economic collapse might lead the Kremlin to lash out more severely against Ukraine and the West. But there is an opportunity to be seized if the ruble\u2019s fragility increases Russia\u2019s readiness to de-escalate the war in Ukraine in exchange for relief on sanctions and revitalized economic ties with the West.The roots of the ruble crisis are twofold, brought on by the decline in global oil prices, which sharply cut Russian state revenues and made the national budget untenable, and by the impact of sanctions that the United States and the European Union have imposed in response to the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to undercut Ukrainian independence. While the sanctions have had some economic impact, more importantly, they have made it harder for Russian banks and companies to refinance maturing debt, and have led private citizens to send their funds abroad. All this makes an already risky business climate much worse.The collapsing economy adds serious risk to an already tense standoff with Russia. Mr. Putin is well aware that his popularity rests on economic, social and political stability. A severe downturn could erode his domestic support. To save himself, he may again resort to the dual levers of nationalism and foreign adventurism to shore up his popularity at home. While this strategy would not be sustainable in the long term, in the near term it would guarantee that the animosity between Russia and the West spirals to dangerous new lows. The most severe consequences would surely be felt by Ukraine, but the Baltic states could also be targeted.\u2022 Russia would fully comply with the September Minsk agreement on Eastern Ukraine: After Russia\u2019s invasion in August, an accord was reached promising the disputed Donbass region more autonomy in exchange for a cease-fire and restoration of Ukrainian control of its borders. The cease-fire has been continuously violated, and the Kremlin bears the brunt of the blame. To get sanctions relief, Russia would first have to withdraw all remaining Russian forces from Ukrainian territory and fully support border monitoring by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Europe and the United States would need to operate on a mutual understanding that if Russia reneged on its promise, sanctions would be immediately reimposed. For its part, Kiev would have to redouble its efforts to bring pro-Ukrainian militias operating in the east under control and prepare to implement the elections and aid efforts called for by the agreement.\u2022NATO would continue to strengthen its deterrent posture in Eastern Europe to hedge against increased risk to its members. There has been reticence in some capitals to implement NATO\u2019s new Readiness Action Plan. That must change. Reinforcement of the alliance\u2019s eastern flank is essential insurance against another breakdown in its relationship with Russia. Washington should commit to a persistent presence of ground forces in the Baltic states and Poland. But for deterrence to work, forward deployments must be more multinational. Small numbers of European forces need to be deployed in Baltic states and Poland and hold regular exercises to reinforce deterrence.\u2022As part of a broader deal, Ukraine would have to recognize publicly that it is not currently prepared for NATO membership. Russia has longstanding objections to the possibility that Ukraine might join NATO. While it is crucial that Kiev make its own decisions about membership, and NATO must maintain its longstanding open-door policy, the fact is that Ukraine today is still far from meeting the necessary membership requirements. Recognition by Kiev that it will not attain membership in the near term would simply be an acknowledgement of this reality. Nevertheless, Ukraine could still have an enhanced partnership with NATO.\u2022Russia would have to accept a closer Ukrainian relationship with the European Union \u2014 as well as deepen its own. It was Ukraine\u2019s interest in moving closer to the union that sparked the initial crisis. Better and closer ties are in the interests of both countries. Russian concerns with being cut off from access to Ukrainian markets, however, should be taken into account. (Access to the Russian market for Ukraine\u2019s exports is important to the Ukrainians, too.)\u2022The West would have to make a firmer commitment to supporting internal reforms in Ukraine. Though it has committed funding and advisory support to help strengthen Ukraine\u2019s political, economic and military institutions, a larger, longer-term commitment is needed. Ukraine must do its share by tackling corruption, raising domestic energy prices, reforming its energy sector, and undertaking other structural reforms.Even as the Minsk talks collapsed, Russia agreed to continue providing Ukraine with coal and electricity, a sign that Moscow may still be seeking a deal. We think this package would offer Russia a brighter economic future along with recognition of Russia\u2019s enduring importance to the West. It would also stabilize Ukraine. But it still may be a hard sell. Reviving the Group of 8, NATO-Russia Council and other channels as part of a comprehensive deal would help. So would high level E.U.-Eurasian Union meetings.Mr. Putin may still choose to escalate the confrontation in spite of the economic storm ahead. But American and European diplomats must use the crisis to offer him an alternative path.

{"Headline": "Amazon Not as Unstoppable as It Might Appear", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThanks to its ugly spat with book publishers, Amazon has lately been cast as the abominable boogeyman of American commerce.But there\u2019s another theory about Amazon\u2019s future, one for which evidence began to mount this year: Despite fears of Amazon\u2019s growing invincibility, the company\u2019s eventual hegemony over American shopping is not assured. It might not even be likely.Amazon may face a deeper problem. Like many of the local and big-box retailers it has displaced over the last decade and a half, Amazon could itself become increasingly vulnerable to the threat of technological upheaval.The key to its vulnerability is the smartphone, a device whose scope and significance Jeff Bezos, the chief executive, has not yet managed to corral.Phones have already radically altered both the way Americans shop and how retail goods move about the economy, but the transformation is just beginning \u2014 and it is far from guaranteed that Amazon will emerge victorious from the transition.As local retailers adopt such mobile innovations, customers will be able to search stores\u2019 inventories, purchase goods for same-day delivery, and navigate and search for help and reviews inside a crowded store. None of these technologies pose an existential threat to Amazon, but by giving physical stores some of the conveniences that Amazon has long had, they may limit its potential reach.\u201cWe want to use the city as our warehouse instead of building a warehouse outside the city,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said. \u201cWe want to be part of a city versus saying, \u2018Here\u2019s a way that you can save $2 on an item, but nobody in your city earns a dime, but now you have a cheap DVD player \u2014 congratulations!\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe Bay Area has become a hotbed for some of the most innovative retailing start-ups.These services all have in common speed and convenience: Because they route purchases from stores, they can often shuttle goods to buyers faster than they are available from Amazon. The prices are even competitive with Amazon, which delivers most of its products, even groceries, from warehouses that are a few hours away.And speed changes everything.I used to buy just about everything from Amazon; in 2012, my household recorded 141 purchases from the retailer, not including digital items like Kindle books. Many of these were for staples like paper towels and baby diapers. But when you run out of diapers, you can\u2019t really wait a day or two to get them.Now, with Instacart and Google Express, I can search for these staples at nearby stores, and get them within just a few hours of my purchase. The more I used these faster services, the less I used Amazon.In 2013, my Amazon orders slipped to 115, about 20 percent down from the previous year. This year, my Amazon purchases will be down again \u2014 I\u2019m at 90 for the year, down by about a third from my 2012 peak.Am I an outlier? Almost certainly, given that Amazon\u2019s overall sales have continued to grow at a fast clip over the last two years.And none of the start-ups that are challenging Amazon expect to meaningfully slow its growth in its core categories. But they do see opportunities in new areas, like food, medicine, apparel and other categories where Amazon is not yet indomitable. So far, these new ideas have seen rapid growth.Instacart is poised to generate more than $100 million in revenue in 2014, 10 times what it did in 2013, according to the company. \u201cWe believe we started with the hardest vertical, and we\u2019ll expand from there,\u201d said Mr. Mehta, who used to work at Amazon as a logistics expert. \u201cOnce you know how to pick avocados, picking towels is a lot easier.\u201dTo Mr. Mehta, the biggest advantage of Instacart\u2019s model is that it co-opts local retailers rather than turning them into enemies. Stores that use Instacart have seen sales go up by 10 percent annually, he said; that\u2019s huge in the grocery business, where sales increases are often measured in the single digits. \u201cWe\u2019re the retailer\u2019s best friend,\u201d Mr. Mehta said.Maybe so. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that about half of the people who are buying with us via Instacart said they would not have shopped with us if they did not have this option,\u201d said Jackie Donovan, the vice president for marketing at Fairway Market, the New York-based specialty grocery store. \u201cIt\u2019s been extraordinarily successful for us.\u201dBut the challenge for Amazon is that it may not be able to do all that it wants to do to take over the nation\u2019s retail landscape.More than a decade later, Mr. Harinarayan and his partner sold another company, Kosmix, to Walmart Stores, where he then worked to improve that company\u2019s digital efforts. Having seen both retail giants from the inside, Mr. Harinarayan pointed out one big difference between the two: Walmart\u2019s investors have long expected it to show profits; Amazon\u2019s have not.\u201cWall Street has given them a lot of leeway in prioritizing growth over profitability, and they\u2019ve taken full advantage of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to get harder and harder to get that license, and when that happens, we\u2019ll see how their business starts to look, and how they respond to challenges.\u201dA picture caption on Thursday with the State of the Art column, about Amazon.com\u2019s vulnerability to technological advances, misidentified the manager of a courier fleet in San Francisco in some copies.

{"Headline": "Greek Patience With Austerity Nears Its Limit ", "Date": "2014-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 PhotosNEA IONIA, Greece \u2014 Alexandra Nikolovieni, 55, lost her job escorting young children on a school bus four years ago and has not been able to find another one since. To help financially, her daughter and her son-in-law, who have two children, moved into her house. But now they have lost their jobs, too.Ms. Nikolovieni, who volunteers at a food pantry in this suburb of Athens, says that every month she sees more and more people like her, qualifying for bundles of groceries and picking out used shoes for themselves or their children.\u201cAre things getting better?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dBut at the street level in Greece, there is little debate anymore, if there ever was. The images of suffering here have not been that different from the grainy black and white photos of the United States in the 1930s. Suicides have shot up. Cars sit abandoned in the streets. People sift garbage looking for food.About 900,000 of the more than 1.3 million who are out of work have not had a paycheck in more than two years, experts say.Kostas Polychronopoulos, who runs a volunteer soup kitchen in Athens and has been out of a job since 2009, said he had seen many shocking things in recent years, including an old woman in a fur coat who watched from a distance for a long time before finally approaching to accept food.When he insisted on taking her home, he found she was living in an empty apartment. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even have water,\u201d he said.It is unclear where such an act of defiance might lead, whether Greece\u2019s creditors would be willing to change their approach or whether Greece even might find itself in the unprecedented position of facing expulsion from the eurozone, or even the European bloc altogether.Yet for many Greeks who have lost everything, rebellion may be a choice they cannot resist, even if it is a scary one.Michalis Mitsopoulos, an economist who has written two books on the crisis, says many of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s ideas are unworkable. But, he adds, many Greeks are desperate, saying to themselves: \u201cI have no job. I am going to lose my house. My children have no future. What more can happen to me?\u201dEven if more recent optimistic projections are to be believed, and a steady rate of growth can be expected, it would take Greece perhaps 15 years to regain the jobs it has lost, said Panagiotis Liargovas, the director of the Greek Parliamentary Budget Office.\u201cThe mix was not right,\u201d Mr. Liargovas said of the austerity measures. \u201cIt was a cure that has almost killed the patient.\u201dThe three international lenders \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank \u2014 were initially seen in Greece as saviors, and the austerity program has had some notable successes. When Greece was forced to ask for help, its deficit was more than four times the 3 percent of gross domestic product allowed under European Union rules. The financial markets had lost confidence in the country. Greece desperately needed money to pay its bills, but the cost of borrowing on the financial markets had become prohibitive.Now, Greece is no longer spending far more than it receives, when debt payments are excluded, its officials say. It has remained in the European Union, and can again borrow in the bond markets, though at interest rates that have been creeping up again, indicating investors\u2019 concern about the nation\u2019s path.But the failures have been striking, leaving millions of Greeks baffled and angry as their lives disintegrated while the elite often escaped, untaxed and unbothered, experts say.Lefteris Pantazopoulos, 60, used to own three hardware stores that employed six people. Today, only one store remains open in Nea Ionia, with Mr. Pantazopoulos behind the counter and hardly any profit.Looking back, the I.M.F. concluded that many errors had been made, including too much emphasis on raising taxes instead of cutting expenses. In addition, the monetary fund overestimated the ability of the government to deliver the changes it was demanding \u2014 because they were proving politically unpopular and because Greek institutions were far weaker that anyone understood.Over the last four years, the three lenders have demanded more than 800 actions a year, Greek officials say, requiring hundreds of new laws, sometimes changed and readopted within weeks or days.Experts say that even now the Greek tax collection system does not truly function. Investigations into the Greek elite and their secret foreign accounts have foundered even in the face of public exposure of the accounts.And some new measures instituted to collect taxes \u2014 for instance, the ability to take the money from someone\u2019s bank account, or to assume a level of income because of the size of a house or the sale of a property \u2014 have led to all sorts of Kafkaesque situations.One economist said that almost his entire salary went to property taxes, though he could not sell his property without incurring an even larger tax bill. If he sells, he must pay tax on the assessed value as a result of a measure intended to keep people from taking cash under the table. But the property is no longer worth that much. On top of that, one of his properties has two ruined buildings on it, so selling it within the calendar year would lead the tax authorities to treat him as a real estate broker and demand taxes on a projected salary that he does not have.The one bright spot in the economy has been tourism. But even on Greece\u2019s most famous islands, such as Corfu, there is little sense of relief. Many tourists come on cut-rate or all-inclusive packages. The wages of hotel workers have been cut severely, and many are not paid for months, if at all, according to union officials and Corfu\u2019s mayor, Kostas Nikolouzos.Mr. Nikolouzos said he was worried that drastic budget cuts could affect the islands\u2019 ability to attract tourists. The municipality once had a budget of 13 million euros a year for capital repairs. This year, it will be one million euros, though roads are buckling and some villagers can no longer drink their tap water.Eleni Alexaki, 56, has worked as a hotel maid for more than 20 years. She was cleaning 20 rooms a day at the beginning of the crisis and now cleans 35, while her pay has gone from 1,600 euros a month to 985. She receives no holiday pay and fewer days off.\u201cAnd they terrorize us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say, \u2018There, the door is there.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPericles Mastoras, 59, a cook in a different hotel, needs an M.R.I. for a kidney problem, but he has not been paid since October. As he sat in his union office recently, his cellphone rang, but the conversation with his boss was brief.\u201cHe said, \u2018Call back tomorrow,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Mastoras said. \u201cThat means I won\u2019t get the money for months.\u201dDimitris Bounias and Nikolas Leontopoulos contributed reporting from Athens, and Nikolia Apostolou from Corfu, Greece.Advertisement"}

At its best, the movie suggests some obvious questions about money, materialism and social class. Seeing the film provides an opening to start the sort of meaningful conversations we all want to have at this time of year, when family is often close at hand.Cue the rolling of the children\u2019s eyes, you say to yourself. Must grown-ups turn everything fun into a teachable moment?Look, our job is to answer their questions and explain the world to them, even if in this case it\u2019s fictional. And if we think they aren\u2019t noticing the Daddy Warbucks character\u2019s space-age bachelor pad in the sky or wondering about the grand pronouncements about money and yearning by the group-home housemother Miss Hannigan, then we are probably mistaken.Sure enough, they noticed plenty. Like many children their age and younger, they are capable of incredible nuance on these topics. So much so that drawing children out can be a learning experience for grown-ups too.Here is what we talked about \u2014 and the things you might discuss with your younger moviegoing companions as well:In the movie\u2019s first scene, Annie presents a report to her classmates about the New Deal, which happened when everyone was poor, and offhandedly declares that the same thing is true today. The half-dozen students I spoke to said that felt true to them and that they identified more with the poor than with the middle class or rich. Still, they defined the lowest rung on the social class ladder in different ways, even among themselves.But the word can also be an insult, hurled as a weapon meant to wound. \u201cPoor means not good enough,\u201d said Fariha Ahmed, 13, an eighth grader. \u201cThat people are not living up to expectations and they\u2019re different from you.\u201dThat may be true. But real children who yearn for things they can\u2019t afford (or things their parents will not buy for them) feel the absence anyway. \u201cI get jealous,\u201d said Sheyra Perez, 12, a seventh grader. \u201cIf I want the type of sneaker that just came out, and another person got it, I\u2019ll think that they have more money.\u201dThere is a fairness angle to this, too, and the children said they felt it, while trying not to let it affect how they see their luckier classmates. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that we have to work for things and other people don\u2019t. But at the same time, I\u2019m not jealous,\u201d Kiersten said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for what I have, and I don\u2019t have to hate on you.\u201dBut they listed other dreams when I asked them to conjure up some personal ones that seemed reasonable to them \u2014 to be a doctor or an astronaut. And Fariha dismissed the idea that money should be the central driving force. \u201cSometimes even money gets tedious,\u201d she said. Instead, she wants power. \u201cIf you have power, that means nobody can intimidate you.\u201dThe film ends with a truly modern, weaponless chase scene, after Annie is kidnapped and driven toward New Jersey in a Subaru. As she moves about, her pursuers track her through social media. Other children who recognize her on the highway and see her waving desperately through the car window take her picture. They tag her on Instagram and Twitter with their locations, and her rescuers eventually catch up with her.\u201cIt felt for me like a commercial for cellphones,\u201d Kiersten said. \u201cSocial media is a competition. Who has the most \u2018likes.\u2019 The most friends. The best pics. The most comments. The most emails. The most emojis.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to our world?\u201d Fariha wondered aloud. \u201cI honestly feel like the world has become corrupt with technology. It\u2019s O.K. to have something for its better uses, but sometimes you have to have limits.\u201d\u201cStacks was doing his job,\u201d said Shah Mazhar, a 12-year-old seventh grader. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t even have any fun. Money can\u2019t bring you happiness.\u201d\u201cHe had no one to share it with,\u201d Kiersten added.Mediocre singing and dancing aside, what \u201cAnnie\u201d can teach with just a bit of prompting and a few open-ended questions is this: We get the greatest joy from our relationships and shared experiences with those people we love, not from the things we own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Battle Over Spending Bill Exposes Democratic Rift", "Date": "2014-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren once famously said that she was willing to see \u201cplenty of blood and teeth left on the floor\u201d in her fight against Wall Street excess.And the Massachusetts Democrat finally found the perfect moment to throw a punch. Ms. Warren, who entered Congress with a liberal halo of anti-Wall Street credibility, took her most high-profile and tenacious Senate stand last week over a single provision in a $1.1 trillion spending bill, one that would roll back portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, the financial industry regulatory law. Taking to the Senate floor, Ms. Warren implored her Democratic colleagues not to support the deal \u2014 and in the process threatened the entire bipartisan spending package that would avert a government shutdown. Though the bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday evening and appeared headed for passage in the Senate, Ms. Warren\u2019s relentless fight to defeat it elevated her status as the leader of her party\u2019s liberal base.Her effort to lead that revolt exposed emerging rifts between the progressive wing and the centrist middle in a Democratic Party struggling to find its footing after losing its majority in the Senate and falling further into the minority in the House in the midterm elections.It also put Ms. Warren at odds with President Obama, who supports the compromise bill despite his criticism of the provision, and other Democrats, including Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader.Many in the party believe that their losses in November can be attributed to the lack of a muscular, coherent message about how Democrats would address economic anxieties, particularly among working-class whites. That void offers new opportunity for Ms. Warren, whose populist leanings and fiery, us-versus-them speeches resonate well with organized labor and other workers left struggling since the financial crisis. The groundswell that Ms. Warren helped stoke last week offered an early glimpse of the complicated 2016 presidential dynamics that the Democratic Party is now facing.Hillary Rodham Clinton is considered such a prohibitive favorite in the Democratic race \u2014 if she runs \u2014 that she has almost cleared the field of strong challengers. And that has created a vacuum on the left that many liberals, who believe the party is not being sufficiently bold or aggressive in its efforts to connect with middle-class America, are desperate to fill.Ms. Warren has repeatedly said she is not planning to run for president. Her goal, said an aide, is to influence policy debates and negotiations on any Dodd-Frank rollbacks, and to show that the party\u2019s base will fight to protect Wall Street regulation. But she is also proudly claiming what Howard Dean once called \u201cthe Democratic wing of the Democratic Party\u201d \u2014 a left-leaning constituency that many politicians are nervous to cultivate. And the affection is mutual. The liberal group MoveOn.org is preparing to spend $1 million to persuade Ms. Warren to enter the presidential race. And more than 300 former Obama campaign staff members Friday released a letter calling on Ms. Warren to run.\u201cRising income inequality is the challenge of our times, and we want someone who will stand up for working families and take on the Wall Street banks and special interests that took down our economy,\u201d the letter reads.However, some Democrats said that the party had always fought against the scaling back of big bank regulation and that the recent fight was more indicative of the current governing climate than any new progressive wave.\u201cI\u2019m not sure this creates an enormous amount of precedent for next year,\u201d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. The government spending bill, with its rollback of some provisions of the Dodd-Frank law, would let big banks trade in certain risky financial instruments while having access to federal assistance if something goes wrong. Similar conditions several years ago helped create the recession, when the government was forced to bail out Wall Street banks seen as \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d As she denounced the bill last week, Ms. Warren warned that a vote for it \u201cis a vote for future taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street.\u201d\u201cThis is about preventing another financial collapse that could again wipe out millions of jobs and take down our whole economy,\u201d Ms. Warren said. One of the ways senior Democrats tried to placate some of their restless colleagues after the elections was to install Ms. Warren to a newly created position within Senate leadership, a perch from which she will be able to help shape policy and messaging.In an interview, Mr. Reid said that one of the lessons of the midterm elections was that voters wanted to know that officials were listening to them. And from his new but shrunken position as the minority leader in the next Congress, he said he planned to take the fight to Republicans on issues like Wall Street regulation and health care.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious to me what the fights are going to be about,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cWe feel it\u2019s time that middle America gets a little help here.\u201dThe simple math of where Democrats on Capitol Hill stand today versus six years ago, when they had commanding majorities, is something many liberals see as a startling reminder of the need to make more enduring connections with voters. Democrats held 257 seats in the House after Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 election. When the new Congress convenes in January, they will have 187. (One race in Arizona is still in a recount.) The Senate picture is just as stark. In 2009, Democrats controlled 60 seats \u2014 a filibuster-proof majority. In the next Congress they will have 46.Representative James P. Moran, Democrat of Virginia, said that in the wake of the recent elections, some of his colleagues were especially skittish and were \u201cnot going to let Elizabeth Warren get to the left of them necessarily.\u201d And a senior Democratic aide, speaking anonymously in order to offer a more candid assessment, warned, \u201cIf this party can\u2019t accommodate both its Clinton-era folks and its Warren-ites, we\u2019re headed for trouble.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Falling prices for oil, Russia\u2019s main export commodity, and Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis have battered the currency and economy.Some economists say Russia is now trapped in the insidious economic quicksand of stagflation, or high inflation and low growth, with few good policy options. The bank said it would continue raising rates, if inflation and by extension the ruble decline did not come under control.But the central bank is fighting an uphill battle, as the economy continues to deteriorate.The increase in the bank\u2019s base rate on Thursday to 10.5 percent from 9.5 percent should have encouraged Russian individuals, companies and banks to hold savings in rubles, rather than shift them into dollars. Instead, the ruble continued its plunge on Thursday.The central bank has also tried to defend the currency, by spending $75 billion since the beginning of the year in an effort to prop up the ruble. But it has been a fruitless task.The currency has weakened preciptiously since the start of the year, falling more than 40 percent to around 55 rubles to the American dollar. The bulk of the drop has taken place since September.Officially, the Russian central bank has decided to let the ruble float freely, so that a decline against the dollar might actually help domestic manufacturers and farmers, while rising prices of imports in ruble terms crimp demand for them, helping the trade balance. The bank has largely switched from setting a target for exchange rates, to setting a target for inflation.But it is a difficult balancing act. And because a large portion of consumer goods, including food, is imported, the bank cannot cap inflation without controlling the ruble slide.The bank had been striving to keep rates low, to bolster business activity and growth, rather than steepen the economic slowdown with higher rates, but pivoted to raising rates last spring after the Ukraine crisis put more pressure on the ruble.The pressure has only mounted. A week ago, the Russian government conceded for the first time that the economy was facing a recession. The government said the economy will contract by 0.8 percent in 2015, while inflation is now running at 9 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Split Over Congressional Budget Office Head", "Date": "2014-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo it is one of the stranger surprises of the midterm election fallout that the question of whether to reappoint him to his post has become a hot topic of debate \u2014 among Republicans.Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, agreed. \u201cIt would be absurd for a Republican-controlled Congress to keep Elmendorf at the helm of the C.B.O.\u201d he said. \u201cFor a party looking to change the culture in Washington, this would be a good place to start.\u201dThe budget office wields enormous power in its proclamations over legislative cost and effect; working the referee has been time-honored since the office\u2019s creation in 1974. But the hand-wringing over the changing of director has almost always been partisan, not intraparty.In 1981, officials in the Reagan administration wanted to oust the C.B.O.\u2019s founding director, Alice M. Rivlin, when they took over Washington, but they were thwarted by senior Republicans in Congress who said that was a Hill prerogative. Republicans lamented the fate of the budget office when Democrats picked Peter R. Orszag, whom they viewed as the Democratic Party\u2019s go-to economist. Democrats were aghast when Republicans picked Douglas Holtz-Eakin to move from President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers to the director\u2019s office.The decision rests in the hands of Republican leaders, including the new chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees as well as the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees. Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican and a strong conservative, will be writing the House\u2019s budget next year, while Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin moves to the Ways and Means Committee, which originates tax bills and has the dominant role in health care legislation.Both men argue that the budget office should use more \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d when assessing the cost of tax cuts, saying the impact on the Treasury would be mitigated greatly by the additional economic growth they contend the cuts would engender.Such a change in scorekeeping, based on the supply side theory popular among conservatives, would ease the push to overhaul the tax code and produce an ostensibly balanced budget while lowering top individual and corporate tax rates.That has Democrats worried.\u201cIf they\u2019re bringing in a C.B.O. director with the intention of getting someone who\u2019s going to apply voodoo economics to the budget, that\u2019s a real problem,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cIf they\u2019re looking for someone who is going to cook the books, that\u2019s a real problem.\u201dSo far, no director has taken the C.B.O. down a partisan rabbit hole.\u201cEvery time, people worry about politicization,\u201d said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, who has become increasingly aligned with conservative politics since leaving the budget office. \u201cIt is in the statute that it be nonpartisan, and I generally don\u2019t fall out of bed wanting to break the law. And it\u2019s in the DNA of the staff.\u201dMs. Rivlin said it was possible for a director to warp the institution, asserting more partisan leadership, prompting staff departures and replacing them with more partisan appointments.But, she said, \u201cIt never has, because both parties have appointed directors who understand the mission of C.B.O. is to be very nonpartisan and have made an effort to not inject their own views into the picture.\u201dThis transition has been more perilous than most. Mr. Elmendorf has told congressional leaders and committee chairmen that he wants another term. But aides close to the budget committees say the incoming leadership is looking at a host of new names.The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call has already floated possible replacements. Some, like Jeffrey R. Brown of the University of Illinois and Katherine Baicker of Harvard University, are respected Republican academic economists. Others are more partisan, such as Warren Payne, the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s Republican policy director; J. D. Foster, the deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, formerly of the Heritage Foundation; and James C. Capretta, a frequent contributor to National Review.\u201cDynamic scoring is more realistic, because the path of the economy responds to changes in tax policy,\u201d Mr. Mankiw said in an email response to questions last week. \u201cThe problem is that there is substantial disagreement about which models are most appropriate for estimating those responses. Static scoring makes the clearly wrong assumption that tax policy does not influence the economy, but it has the virtue of being less model-dependent and thus more easily understood.\u201dStill, like his counterparts in the House, the incoming Senate Finance Committee chairman, Orrin G. Hatch, also believes the C.B.O. should be taking another stab at dynamic scoring. Currently, the budget office and the White House Office of Management and Budget use \u201cstatic scoring\u201d on most bills, assessing the cost of tax cuts and spending bills primarily as simple subtraction from revenue or addition to spending totals.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with C.B.O. and O.M.B. doing both a static report and a dynamic report?\u201d Mr. Hatch asked. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid to do the one and not do the other.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Food Program\u2019s Struggle to Feed Millions ", "Date": "2014-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIf the term \u201cinternational community\u201d is to have any meaning, it should denote the shared responsibility of all nations to assist people forced to flee their countries and lose their livelihood through no fault of their own. The 3-and-a-half-year-old Syrian conflict has created one of the largest such populations in the world: 3.2 million people who have taken refuge in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt severely straining the resources of these countries. More than half of them rely for basic sustenance on vouchers from the World Food Program, the food-assistance arm of the United Nations. On Monday, after months of warnings that it\u2019s running out of money, the W.F.P. announced that it had been forced to suspend the critical program. The vouchers are exactly what help from the international community should be all about, and the program should promptly get the funds it needs to carry on as the winter months make the plight of the refugees even more miserable. The impact could be most devastating in Lebanon, where more than 1.1 million refugees are scattered across some 1,700 locations.The W.F.P. said it needs $64 million right away to restore the program through the end of the year, a piddling sum by global economic standards. It is essential that donors deliver the money they have already pledged, and that they now pledge \u2014 and actually deliver \u2014 enough financing so that the W.F.P. does not need to scramble for money month by month.The value of the vouchers was already reduced this fall for lack of funds, as were rations of flour, cooking oil and other basic foods for delivery to millions of people displaced inside Syria. The United States provided the agency with $70 million for the vouchers last week, and another $55 million toward food deliveries in Syria. But that is not enough.The vouchers are similar to debit cards, which recipients can use to buy food in local shops. An advantage of the system is that it injects money into the economies of countries hosting the refugees, helping them with the enormous burden of supporting so many refugees. The W.F.P. says about $800 million has been dispensed since the start of the operation; if the refugees cannot buy food, they will be even less welcome among Syria\u2019s neighbors.Syria is only one of a spreading plague of crises around the world that have placed heavy demands on all international relief organizations, and have compelled them to compete ever more urgently for the donors on whom they depend. W.F.P., for example, has had to feed more people in the West African countries where the rapid spread of Ebola has closed down food markets.It is imperative that the richer members of the international community recognize the rapidly growing need and respond promptly and generously. Many organizations have cut back on programs or have threatened to, but W.F.P. is the first agency that has actually been forced to suspend a vital program, and the thing about food, as one W.F.P. official said, \u201cis, you can\u2019t not have it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Signs of a Tightening Labor Market, but Still Room for Improvement", "Date": "2014-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday's EconomistThough it still has a long way to go, the American job market improved a lot more in 2014 than in 2013.In both years, the jobless rate fell by 0.9 of a percentage point: from 7.9 to 7 percent in 2013 and from 6.7 percent to 5.8 percent in 2014. So why is an identical almost-one-point decline so much better news this year than last?The answer has to do with one of 2014\u2019s more important, if somewhat overlooked, positive economic developments: The rate at which people participate in the labor force stopped falling.This matters because of the way the federal government\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics defines unemployment. To be counted as jobless, you have to be looking for work. If you give up looking, whatever the reason, as far as the B.L.S. is concerned, you\u2019re out of the labor force.But ever since the deep recession that began in late 2007, one reason people had been dropping out of the labor force was precisely because they couldn\u2019t find work. That had the paradoxical effect of making the unemployment rate fall not because more people were finding work but because they were giving up the search for work.In 2013, the share of the working-age population in the labor force fell 0.7 tenths of a percent, accounting for most of the decline in the unemployment rate. What appeared to be a tightening labor market was driven more by people dropping out than getting jobs. This year, the participation rate was nearly flat \u2014 up 0.1 tenth of a point \u2014 revealing a truly tighter labor market.The movement of related indicators completes the story. Employers added jobs in both years but did so faster in 2014. The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is drawn also asks respondents about job growth. Monthly changes from this survey are too erratic to trust, but averaging over the year so far, the economy added 246,000 jobs per month in 2014 compared with 112,000 last year. (If you use the less volatile establishment survey, that same comparison yields 241,000 average jobs gained per month this year versus 204,000 in 2013.)The number of part-timers wanting full-time jobs, another key measure of labor market slack, also fell faster this year than last, a decline of about 900,000 people in 2014 compared with a decline of about 200,000 in 2013. The B.L.S.'s most encompassing measure of slack \u2014 one that includes involuntary part-timers \u2014 fell faster this year than last, 1.7 percentage points versus 1.3 points.The labor force participation rate was about 66 percent before the recession; now it\u2019s about 63 percent. Economists argue about how much of the decline is because of more benign forces, like retirement of baby boomers, as opposed to labor force dropouts who gave up looking for work, but the consensus is that at least half may be a function of weak job growth.I wholeheartedly agree, and would argue that the labor force stabilization we\u2019ve seen is evidence that Ms. Yellen is right. If the economy keeps generating stronger job growth, labor participation should do more than just stay flat; it should tick up a bit.Which brings us to the important caveat with which I began: There\u2019s still a lot of slack left to be squeezed out of the system. For all the actual tightening in the 2014 job market, what is perhaps the most important indicator from the perspective of working families \u2014 wage growth \u2014 has hardly budged. Though commentators made a big deal out of the bump in pay from the last jobs report, the yearly trend in nominal hourly wage growth remains at about 2 percent, where it has been since 2010.Under the assumption that the job market continues to tighten at its recent pace, it will be years before wage growth threatens to be inflationary and the Fed has to hit the brakes by raising rates. That would be late 2018, according to my model, and that\u2019s assuming that the next few years\u2019 labor market gains are more like 2014 than 2013.So the message for policy makers both in Congress and at the Fed: steady as she goes. The labor market is finally tightening up, and that trend has the potential to pay real dividends to both the macroeconomy and the paychecks of working families.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Job Gains and Rising Pay in Labor Data", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEver since the recovery from the Great Recession began more than five years ago, the most crucial missing pieces of the economic puzzle were the lack of consistently strong gains in hiring and better wages for most working Americans struggling to make ends meet. Now, at last, those pieces are starting to fall into place.Even more significant was that the improving job market finally delivered a sharp jump in average hourly earnings for ordinary workers that was double the anticipated 0.2 percent increase.The jobless rate itself stayed at 5.8 percent.The pickup in wage growth comes as gasoline prices are plunging, providing a double boon for consumers and retailers with the holiday shopping season underway.With one month still to go, the total increase in payrolls of 2.65 million is already the best annual figure since the late 1990s.\u201cIn one line: spectacular and, more to the point, believable,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\u201cWe\u2019ve had strong hiring indicators in a number of surveys, and lower jobless claims, so sooner or later, we were going to get a blockbuster number.\u201dIn economics most things cut both ways, however, and Friday\u2019s report was no exception. The steadily improving labor market makes it more likely the Federal Reserve will start raising short-term interest rates sooner rather than later, which could lead to some turmoil in financial markets in the months ahead.Most economists expect the central bank to increase interest rates in mid-2015, after leaving them near zero since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008. Some experts now argue that the Fed may move to raise its key interest rate lever as early as March next year, but most are still sticking with midyear.In addition, some of the worrisome signs that have haunted the monthly jobs report for years have not gone away.The proportion of people in the labor force was unchanged last month and is stuck near multidecade lows, an indication that few of the workers who gave up the search for work during the lean years are likely to be hired anytime soon.In addition, about 6.9 million Americans are working part time because they cannot find full-time positions. The broadest measure of unemployment, which includes these workers, dropped to 11.3 percent, down 0.1 percent from October.Mr. Shepherdson cautioned that he wanted to see the stronger hourly wage gain in November \u2014 up 0.4 percent after an anemic 0.1 increase in October and no gain in September \u2014 continue for several months before he would be convinced higher wages were here to stay. \u201cI\u2019ve had my fingers burned before,\u201d he said.The November data alone isn\u2019t enough to shift the Fed\u2019s thinking, said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. \u201cIn all likelihood, we will see faster wage growth over the next six months, but as far as the Fed is concerned, one month alone could be noise,\u201d he said.\u201cOur view now is that the first rate hike will come in June.\u201dIn particular, Mr. Berger noted that there was a risk the jump in hourly earnings represented a catch-up from the weak readings the previous two months.\u201cThe coming months will tell us whether November was a fluke or the beginning of a sustained pickup from the 2 percent annual wage gains we\u2019ve had over the past four years,\u201d he said.Although the prospect of higher interest rates tends to make investors more cautious, both stocks and bonds rose modestly on Friday, with traders figuring a better job market and better-paid consumers outweighed whatever cooling effect higher borrowing rates could have. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 3.45 points, to 2,075.37, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 58.69 points, to 17,958.79.Although government number crunchers try to adjust for seasonal swings like hiring by stores ahead of the holiday, retailing still showed unusual strength, adding 50,000 workers in November. That was more than twice the average monthly gain of 22,000 retail workers over the last year.Manufacturers, often seen as a bellwether of swings in the broader economy and a source of good blue-collar jobs, particularly for men, hired 28,000 workers in November.One sector that will be watched for signs of weakness in the months ahead is the energy patch. It has been one of the best-performing industries in terms of job growth in recent years, but that could quickly reverse if low oil prices persist. Last month, the number of workers involved directly in drilling and extraction inched up by 200, to 215,200, but support positions in the oil and gas industry shrank by 2,400, to 327,000. This category is still up by more than 20,000 in 2014, but November was the first time this year that the number of energy industry support workers actually fell.Government statisticians also revised upward the number of jobs added in September and October by 44,000, another good sign.Despite the deep economic frustration many Americans express, evident in everything from public opinion surveys to water cooler chats to last month\u2019s congressional elections, the American economy has made significant progress this year. In November 2013, for instance, the unemployment rate was 7 percent, and the jobless rate five years ago this month was 9.9 percent.Last month, average gasoline prices in the United States fell below $3 a gallon for the first time since 2010, as crude oil prices plunged. Crude oil has continued to drop since then, to about $66 a barrel, which suggests prices at the pump have further to drop.If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates next year, the real estate sector could be dealt a setback, especially in more affluent areas where home prices have surged. So why the persistent gloom, not to mention anger?Until now, wage gains for most Americans who kept their jobs throughout the downturn and recovery have been very modest. The 2.1 percent wage increase over the last 12 months is barely enough to keep up with inflation. For wages to show meaningful gains over a sustained period of time, as was the case in the 1990s, the unemployment rate will have to drop further, perhaps below 5 percent, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial.Just how low unemployment can go without stoking inflation is set to become the next big economic argument in Washington as well as on Wall Street. On Capitol Hill, some Republicans say the Fed should move more aggressively to tighten its monetary stance. \u201cAs the job market improves, the Federal Reserve must begin to normalize monetary policy,\u201d said Representative Kevin P. Brady, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.But Ms. Swonk, like many other economists, says it is critical that the central bank not move too quickly now that the recovery finally seems to be settling into higher gear.\u201cWe are still regaining ground lost by many households, and we don\u2019t want to squander that,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cWe\u2019re not back to the 1990s, nowhere near it. But the good news is that we\u2019re making progress.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opting to Avoid a Detour, Passengers Brave a War Zone\u2019s Skies", "Date": "2014-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySyria JournalABOARD MIDDLE EAST AIRLINES FLIGHT 312, OVER SYRIA \u2014 From a plane wheeling east at 30,000 feet, leaving behind the hills and patchwork farms of Lebanon, the Syrian desert ripples to the horizon like a tide-sculpted beach.Somewhere off to the south is the capital, Damascus, where government warplanes bombard rebellious suburbs and insurgent mortar shells fly toward the city center. To the north is Homs, its center crushed to rubble from years of fighting, and further ahead lies Deir al-Zour, the desert province where American fighter jets bomb oil wells run by Islamic State militants.None of this chaos below appears to faze the passengers aboard this flight from Beirut, Lebanon, to Amman, Jordan. Middle East Airlines, a Lebanese carrier, is one of the few that still routinely cross Syrian airspace. Many regulars, this reporter included, choose the flight because, even detouring slightly from its prewar path to avoid Damascus, it takes just 70 minutes, 40 less than other airlines\u2019 roundabout routes.Passengers lucky enough to have a row of seats to themselves lie down for catnaps, ignoring the flight attendants bearing cheese sandwiches and olives. Children peer over the seats, and businessmen and United Nations officials shuffle through paperwork. Syrian passengers exiled by war track the plane\u2019s path across the map on their seat-back monitors, and on clear afternoons peer wistfully out the window as if hoping to catch glimpses of home.Recently, on a night flight, the pilot declared, \u201cWe are now flying over an unstable area. Please return to your seats.\u201d He was referring not to politics or military maneuvers below, but to air turbulence.Last month, the United States Embassy in Beirut issued a warning exhorting American citizens to avoid commercial flights over Syria, and prohibited its own staff from taking them \u2014 an understandable concern after the downing in July of a Malaysian airliner by a missile over another conflict zone, Ukraine.Yet for many of Middle East Airlines\u2019s frequent fliers, such warnings tend to fade into the background noise of the region\u2019s perennial conflict.The Beirut terminal is nothing like the one in the 1980s. It sparkles with Christmas lights and shops selling Chanel cosmetics, jeweled slippers and baklava. Passengers wait at gates for flights to the southern Iraqi city of Najaf, to Dubai, to Riyadh, many of which also fly over Syria without ado.Taking off for Amman, the plane flies north along the Lebanese coast, then turns east over green mountains clustered with villas and apartment buildings. It crosses the Bekaa Valley, from which Hezbollah fighters entered Syria to help the government retake the town of Qusayr, and over Syria\u2019s Qalamoun mountains, which still shelter insurgents.The seat-back screens play a montage promoting an advertiser\u2019s version of Lebanese attractions: cedar forests and pistachio sweets, yes, but also lavish wedding venues and plastic surgery clinics, where clients can recover in rooms decked out like hotel suites. Passengers flip through complimentary newspapers for the latest Lebanese news. (\u201cSix Soldiers Martyred in Jihadi Ambush.\u201d)On one recent flight, Joseph Kmid, an interior designer, was heading to decorate a new duty-free shop at Amman\u2019s gleaming and expanding airport. Furman al-Shukri was traveling for his clothing business. Asked if they had any fears of flying, both seemed almost surprised.\u201cMy problem is that business is bad,\u201d Mr. Shukri said, complaining that three years of conflict had shuttered Syrian textile factories and dampened the market.The risks of the flight, and the hardships of those who can afford a $250 round-trip ticket, seem insignificant compared with those facing Syrians stuck on the ground: cities and economies in ruins; more than 200,000 killed; and more than three million refugees, one million of them in Lebanon, another 620,000 in Jordan.The war in Syria and the hair-raising consular travel advisories for Lebanon include risks of rocket attacks, suicide bombs, clashes between the authorities and \u201ccriminal elements,\u201d and hostilities that could erupt at any time between militant groups and Israel, just to name a few.All of those dangers exist on the ground, and yet the list of potential calamities belies the day-to-day experience in Lebanon of noisy construction sites and traffic jams, shiny shopping malls and muddy farms. It is a country where, despite the refugee crisis and conflict on the border, rich and poor commute to work and school, rarely coming into direct contact with anything more menacing than a police checkpoint.After landing in Amman one recent evening, a flight attendant opined that the safety warnings were \u201call political, to make Syria look bad,\u201d and that the airline\u2019s Saudi, Emirati and Jordanian competitors avoided Syrian airspace because they feared government warplanes might take revenge for those countries\u2019 support for the insurgency against President Bashar al-Assad.\u201cWe are not going to waste our lives and the pilot\u2019s life,\u201d added the flight attendant, who makes two runs over Syria daily and declined to give her name because she was not authorized to speak for the airline. She said passengers often asked, \u201cIs it safe?\u201d But she doubts they are that scared, she said, or they would not be on the plane.Indeed, Irina Prentice, a United Nations official who regularly takes the flight, said that when Syrian insurgents began shooting down helicopters and the occasional low-flying warplane two years ago, she had second thoughts about her itinerary. But they lasted only until it was time to buy her next ticket.United Nations officials shuttling to and from Damascus, where their hotel, the Four Seasons, has been shelled, think of the flight as the least of their worries.On a recent flight, looking down at the dry land striped with the gray lines of roads and occasional clusters of cube-like houses, Ms. Prentice recalled, her main emotion was sadness. She said she looked forward to the day she could look down from the air \u201cknowing that the war came to an end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Success Draws Competition for Luxury E-Retailer Yoox", "Date": "2014-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOLOGNA, Italy \u2014 In an unmarked warehouse at a vast industrial park on the outskirts of Bologna, a three-story-tall robot is mining for a gem: a $980 sleeveless cocktail dress from Armani, in French size 42.This is how things work, behind the scenes, in the global electronic-commerce market for luxury goods \u2014 one of the last retail industries to drop the merchant\u2019s veil of mystery and bow to digital efficiency.From this warehouse, the Yoox Group, an Italian company that has emerged as a global leader in online luxury, fulfills three million orders a year. Many of those will ship in the next few weeks, during gift buying\u2019s high season, to customers in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and Asia. Helping fulfill those orders will be Yoox distribution centers in the New Jersey city of Clifton, Tokyo and Shanghai.As the giant machine here speeds on rails at 20 feet per second, its mechanical arm swoops and jerks as its radio-frequency tag reader scans one of 46 shelves packed floor to ceiling with around five million items \u2014 including Ralph Lauren jackets, Jimmy Choo shoes and Lanvin purses \u2014 from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious designers.When it locates the dress \u2014 a V-necked silk, with a ribbon of pink chiffon cascading off each shoulder \u2014 the machine plucks the packaged garment from its shelf and deposits it onto a conveyor belt. The belt snakes nearly three miles before reaching a packing station, where products are boxed by hand in eco-friendly packaging and dispatched for delivery.In the past, the inventory inside these drab walls could only be found on the racks of glittering boutiques of Fifth Avenue in New York, the Ginza district in Tokyo, Avenue Montaigne in Paris or Bond Street in London. But Yoox, through years of persistence, persuaded the luxury designers that there could be an online market for their last-season lines and overstocked items, without cannibalizing their in-store retail businesses.\u201cBasically, we are bridging two worlds,\u201d Federico Marchetti, 45, the chief executive of Yoox, said in an interview at its headquarters in Milan. \u201cE-commerce is a very analytical and process-driven business, while luxury is very visual \u2014 it\u2019s all about creativity, the content and image.\u201dCompared with book publishers, music labels and toy makers, luxury goods were slow to go digital. The markers feared \u2014 besides a loss of cachet \u2014 that customers might doubt the authenticity of designer wares sold online. Even now, the websites of many top brands, like Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s, remain little more than digital billboards.But the fashion world\u2019s digital wariness is fading fast.Although online sales still generate less than 5 percent of the $270 billion in annual luxury revenues today, global e-commerce in luxury is growing at a 30 percent rate a year, according to Altagamma, a Milan-based trade association for the luxury industry. By the end of the decade, Altagamma predicts, e-commerce could represent as much as one-fifth of luxury revenue \u2014 on par with retailers of consumer electronics, gardening supplies and home appliances.\u201cWe are at an inflection point,\u201d said Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London. \u201cLuxury goods companies still have quite a way to go in terms of reach and customer experience and integrating their online and physical offer. But in the next few years, you are probably going to see a very significant surge in digital engagement by luxury brands.\u201dThe e-luxury sites have grown by serving as online merchants for the designer brands. But Yoox also makes about one-third of its revenue \u2014 which totaled 456 million euros, or about $563 million last year \u2014 by providing the back-end technology for the designers\u2019 own websites, including Valentino, Alexander Wang, Dolce & Gabbana and Jil Sander. The pickup in luxury e-tailing could enable Yoox to grow and prosper. The risk, though, is that as more luxury brands recognize the possibilities of online commerce, they will elect to take that business in-house, rather than farm it out to Yoox.\u201cYoox was a shortcut for luxury brands to go online at a time when online was seen as something exotic and separate,\u201d Mr. Solca said. \u201cThe more that the large brands realize that this is strategic, the risk is that they become less willing to accept the powered-by-Yoox offer.\u201dFounded in 1999 by Mr. Marchetti, Yoox was one of the earliest entrants to the online luxury market. At the time, Mr. Marchetti \u2014 the son of a Fiat warehouse manager and a telephone operator \u2014 was a recent graduate of Columbia Business School in New York with a previous background in investment banking and a passion for technology and beautiful things.He was also very busy.\u201cThe definition of luxury is so different to many people,\u201d Mr. Marchetti said. \u2018'For me it\u2019s time, I was buying luxury, but I didn\u2019t have time to go around to the shops. I wanted this kind of a store, to be able to find everything I wanted in one place.\u201dThe result was Yoox \u2014 the name refers to the Y and X chromosomes, with the \u201cOO\u201d meant to evoke binary digital code \u2014 which made its debut with just over $1.5 million in venture capital funding. Ten years later, in 2009, the company listed on the Milan Stock Exchange.Yoox has a stock market value of just over \u20ac1 billion. But the share price is down more than 40 percent this year, slumping along with many European retailing stocks, in light of the region\u2019s flagging economy. Still, Yoox remains one of the few online luxury players to turn a consistent profit throughout the downturn. Its net earnings rose 24 percent in 2013, to 12.6 million euros, and the company expects both sales and operating profit to increase by 20 percent for full-year 2014.One key to that profitability is maintaining a tight lid on costs, Mr. Marchetti said, which Yoox seeks to do through its highly automated Bologna operation. Next door to its robot-driven warehouse is a mechanized studio, where employees continually dress and photograph a parade of plexi-glass mannequins as they glide along rails. Two-thirds of the images for Yoox.com\u2019s catalogue are produced this way \u2014 up to 200 images per hour. By 2016, nearly all of Yoox.com\u2019s catalogue photos will come from this assembly line.Given the breadth of its inventory and distribution network \u2014 the company has sent more than 30 million items to more than 100 countries \u2014 Yoox is sometimes referred to as the Amazon of high fashion. And with 14 million fashionistas trawling through its stores each month, Yoox also sits on a global gold mine of information about its customers, who spend an average of $250 per order.Those databanks might reveal, say, which colors or skirt lengths are most popular in Shanghai or S\u00e3o Paulo, or track a fading taste in Germany for low-rise skinny jeans. During the recent Black Friday and CyberMonday sales pegged to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend in the United States, Yoox said shoes were by far the most popular item in North America, with high-heeled ankle boots and stiletto sandals at the top of women\u2019s most wanted lists.\u201cThe sheer amount of data they have really puts them in a superior position,\u201d said Philip Guarino, a Paris-based luxury consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge asset for them.\u201dSome Yoox executives say they are flattered by any comparisons to Amazon \u2014 up to a point.\u201cWe are one-one thousandth of their size,\u201d said Alberto Grignolo, Yoox\u2019s general manager, who helped write the roughly 500,000 lines of software code that drive the company\u2019s stores. \u201cWe are similar in that we keep in mind that the customer is the key person on the other side of the screen. And we exploit the same kinds of numbers and processes to the benefit of the customer.\u201dBut in terms of the shopping experience, Mr. Grignolo said, the companies could not be more different.\u201cIf you go and search \u2018Bottega Veneta\u2019 on Amazon, it might come up with a book, an off-brand handbag or maybe some razor blades,\u201d Mr. Grignolo said. \u201cThere is very little way to bridge Amazon with fashion without drastically changing both.\u201d(A recent search of \u2018'Bottega Veneta'\u2019 on Amazon.com returned more than 600 hits \u2014 mainly lower-value items like branded perfumes and sunglasses \u2014 as well as dozens of purses that claimed to be \u201cinspired\u201d by the Italian brand\u2019s signature woven leather bags.)Yoox also tries to distinguish itself from the fashion e-tail pack by acting as a behind-the-scene contractor. Since 2006, it has quietly run the websites, order fulfillment, logistics and customer service operations of more than three-dozen different designers. Yoox provides these services in exchange for a commission of about one-third of the retail sales value of each online purchase.\u201cYoox already had critical mass, rich expertise and rich teams,'\u2019 said Stefano Sassi, chief executive of Valentino, which enlisted Yoox to run its online store in 2008.Valentino \u2014 whose products are also sold on the websites of high-end department stores like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue \u2014 has seen its e-commerce transactions grow to as much as 8 percent of its sales, up from less than 1 percent five years ago, Mr. Sassi said.Two years ago, Yoox landed its most prominent e-commerce partnership to date: a seven-year deal with the French luxury conglomerate Kering to manage the online stores of seven of its most popular labels, including Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney. The arrangement is structured as a joint venture, and Kering has said it is open to letting Yoox drive the online stores of its other brands, which include Gucci, Christopher Kane and Boucheron jewellery. Kering hopes the venture with Yoox can bolster its online sales to as much as \u20ac1 billion by 2018 \u2014 equivalent to around 10 percent of its revenue last year.Yet despite this recent momentum, some analysts worry that Yoox risks losing its early advantages. Generalist e-tailers like Amazon and T-Mall in China are eager to grab a slice of the lucrative luxury pie. That shift could force companies like Yoox to adjust their strategy to confront a more crowded digital marketplace.It might also mean that Yoox, which has spent so many years courting luxury companies, may one day wind up being pursued by one itself.\u201cI could foresee interest from one of the big groups, maybe even Kering itself \u2014 much in the same way that Richemont bought Net-a-Porter,\u201d in 2010, said Mr. Guarino, the Paris analyst. He noted that even Amazon itself has hinted that it may consider entering higher-margin sectors like fashion.Mr. Marchetti would not comment on such speculation, saying he remained focused on expanding Yoox into new markets and new product categories, including accessories like sunglasses and jewelery, and even perfume. This year, the company began operating the online stores of the Italian interior design brand Kartell.But Mr. Marchetti said he had no illusions about the rapidly changing dynamics of luxury retail. To try to keep a step ahead, he said Yoox was already adapting in response to expectations of web-savvy brands by offering consulting services that now include digital marketing, social media strategy and advanced customer analytics.\u201cWe are someone to leverage on,\u201d Mr. Marchetti said. \u201cWe provide the car, but for us the best thing is if we have a great driver. And the driver is the brand.\u201dAn article on Monday about the Yoox Group, an Italian company that has emerged as a global leader in online sales of luxury goods, misstated the company\u2019s net earnings in 2013. It was 12.6 million euros, not EUR12.6 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Reconversion\u2019 of Religious Minorities Roils India\u2019s Politics ", "Date": "2014-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Every other month or so, someone calls the Rev. Phil Oswald and asks if he would be willing to baptize Hindus so they can become Christians.Mr. Oswald said he always referred such callers, whom he assumes to be Hindu nationalists, to native Indian pastors who cannot be deported, an offer that is invariably declined. Even so, Mr. Oswald, who is from the Midwest, said his visa applications had faced unusual delays.Hindu nationalists here claim that Muslims and Christians have been forcing Hindus to convert to their religions for centuries. So there is deep sensitivity to proselytizing by non-Hindus, particularly foreigners. Visas for religious professionals are strictly limited, some missionaries are instructed not to proselytize openly and, now that a Hindu nationalist has become India\u2019s prime minister, hard-line Hindu groups have begun a long-dreamed campaign to claw back some of those conversion losses.The same group has announced plans to convert thousands of Christians to Hinduism on Christmas Day.\u201cWe will bring back those who have lost their way,\u201d Mr. Bhagwat said Saturday. \u201cThey did not go on their own.\u201dAbout 80 percent of India\u2019s 1.2 billion people are Hindus, but nearly 15 percent are Muslims and most of the rest are Christian, Buddhist, Adivasi (indigenous tribes) or Zoroastrians, known as Parsees. Jawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first prime minister, made secularism a central part of his governing philosophy, but religious violence has convulsed India repeatedly, and religious identity often shapes voting patterns. Hindu groups accuse centrist parties of pandering to minorities to win the support of \u201cvote banks.\u201dOpposition lawmakers, denouncing the Hindu conversions as divisive and politically motivated, have united to paralyze India\u2019s upper house of Parliament until Mr. Modi publicly condemns the conversions.\u201cThis is far too serious a national issue for anyone but the prime minister to address in Parliament,\u201d Abhishek Singhvi, a spokesman for the Indian National Congress party, said in an interview.With the parliamentary session scheduled to end this week, the paralysis has stymied Mr. Modi\u2019s modest agenda of change, dealing a serious blow to efforts to revive India\u2019s stalled economy.That Mr. Modi has refused to call for an end to the conversions despite the legislative paralysis has begun to worry political analysts here.In an interview, Nalin Kohli, a spokesman for the Bharatiya Janata Party, noted derisively that India\u2019s previous prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had rarely spoken publicly at all.\u201cWe should leave it to the prime minister\u2019s discretion to choose the time, place and message that he believes are important to the country for him to address,\u201d Mr. Kohli said of Mr. Modi.Shekhar Gupta, a political commentator, said he was surprised that Mr. Modi had so far refused to denounce the conversions \u2014 a seemingly easy price to pay to get his legislative agenda moving.\u201cSo either the prime minister is not strong enough to stop these guys from doing these conversions, or he thinks like them,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know which one of those options is worse.\u201dBut hard-line Hindu groups, impatient with Mr. Modi\u2019s refusal to champion their causes, have shaken off months of quiescence and begun to speak out. Some insist that they are doing so with Mr. Modi\u2019s tacit approval.On Sunday, about 30 Christians were converted to Hinduism in a four-hour ceremony conducted by a chapter of the Vishva Hindu Parishad in a small temple in a village near Kochi, on India\u2019s southern coast, an area where Christianity arrived early and is widespread.Venkateswaran Narayanan, a top Vishva Hindu Parishad official in Kerala, the state where Kochi is, explained that the conversions resulted in part from a crisis in the state caused by \u201cSemitic Abrahamic religious intolerance.\u201d\u201cHindus are facing a lot of problems, and we are trying to address that,\u201d Mr. Narayanan said in an interview.But Cardinal George Alencherry, major archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church in Kerala, said in an interview at his rectory that the recent conversions were unusual and divisive in a state in which different religions have long lived in harmony.\u201cWhy do they do it now, which they did not do one year back?\u201d he asked.Neha Thirani Bagri contributed reporting from Kerala, India.Advertisement"}

Her smudgy rendering is now held up as a profound pop art icon.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a story of faith,\u201d said Andrew Flack, the opera\u2019s librettist who traveled to Borja for research on the production, which is still in the works. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle how it has boosted tourism.\u201d\u201cWhy are people coming to see it if it is such a terrible work of art?\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a pilgrimage of sorts, driven by the media into a phenomenon. God works in mysterious ways. Your disaster could be my miracle.\u201dSince the makeover, the image has attracted more than 150,000 tourists from around the world \u2014 Japan, Brazil, the United States \u2014 to the gothic 16th century Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mercy on a mountain overlooking Borja.Visitors pay one euro, or about $1.25, to study the fresco, encased on a flaking wall behind a clear, bolted cover worthy of the Louvre\u2019s Mona Lisa.The church\u2019s original \u201cEcce Homo\u201d (\u201cBehold the Man\u201d) portrait of a mournful Jesus dated to the 1930s, when El\u00edas Garcia Mart\u00ednez, a Zaragoza art professor, painted it on the church wall.Borja residents did not much notice the painting because the church is dominated by a gilded 18th century baroque altar. But over the years, it bothered Mrs. Gim\u00e9nez to see the bottom third of the fresco vanish, crumbling in the humidity of the dank church.Today, in her home in Borja \u2014 in a living room lined with landscapes she has painted \u2014 Mrs. Gim\u00e9nez recounted that she spent her summers in an apartment by the church.She said she touched up the portrait repeatedly over the years \u2014 with the knowledge of the parish priest and the caretakers, a family that has lived there for generations.But eventually, she said, it required major work, which was abruptly halted after someone complained after the first stage of her brushwork. The story appeared in a local newspaper, then all over the world.In the beginning, after the news broke, her relatives said she cried and refused to eat.\u201cI felt devastated,\u201d Mrs. Gim\u00e9nez said. \u201cThey said it was a crazy, old woman who destroyed a portrait that was worth a lot of money.\u201dToday her celebrity has grown. She hands out prizes for a competition of young artists, who paint their own \u201cEcce Homo\u201d portraits. Children, she said, come by her apartment near the medieval arch of San Francisco and cry: \u201cLook, Cecilia. That\u2019s Cecilia!\u201dMeanwhile, the longtime parish priest, who insisted that he did not formally authorize the touch-up, has been exiled to Zaragoza.In an unrelated case, he has been accused of embezzling 168,000 euros in church funds in a criminal investigation that alleges he was the target of an extortion plot by a Roma clan. In recent months, the judge in charge of the case appealed to the pope to intercede, with the Vatican conducting its own civil investigation.This Christmas, the image of her \u201cEcce Homo\u201d is stamped on the town\u2019s lottery tickets. The portrait also plays a bit part in a popular Spanish movie, with a couple of thieves trying to steal it.\u201cI can\u2019t explain the reaction. I went to see \u2018Ecce Homo\u2019 myself, and still I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d said Borja\u2019s mayor, Miguel Arilla, from his art-filled office.In the economic crisis of the last six years, 300 jobs vanished, he said, but with the tourism boom, restaurants remained stable. Local museums, he added, also benefited. The nearby Museum of Colegiata, housed in a 16th century Renaissance mansion, experienced a rise in annual visits to 70,000 from 7,000 for its religious, medieval art.But fame has also provoked bickering. The grandchildren of the original artist ceded any share of their rights to benefit a hospital foundation that manages the church, the mayor said.But, he said, the great-grandchildren sent a letter through a Valencia lawyer seeking to erase the portrait entirely because the work \u201cdamages the honor of the family.\u201dThe city already commissioned a professional study that concluded it was impossible to restore the piece.As president of the hospital foundation, Mr. Arilla is also involved in final negotiations to sell the rights for the exact image to the Aragonesas winery in neighboring Magall\u00f3n.The winery moved within hours after the news of the failed restoration broke to secure rights to the image, according to Fernando Cura, commercial director for Aragonesas winery. \u201cThe opportunity is that suddenly there is this news that marks this region on the map for the entire world,\u201d he said.But four hours later, the Ruberte Brothers winery also tried to register the mark, provoking a legal struggle.To settle it, Susana Ruberte said her company commissioned an original work by Mrs. Gim\u00e9nez for their special label that finally allowed her to create her own version of \u201cEcce Homo,\u201d demonstrating that she could actually paint.Jos\u00e9 M. Baya, the owner of La B\u00f3veda, in Borja\u2019s market plaza, freely credits her artistry for helping his business flourish.His restaurant in an old stone cellar attracts high-spending tourists, including, he said, a Japanese film crew that ordered the entire two-page menu to sample dishes like rabbit and morcilla.\u201cThe impact of \u2018Ecce Homo\u2019 has been really great for businesses,\u201d said Mr. Baya, who fared well enough to open a second restaurant. \u201cSadly, everyone heads to look at a painting that, frankly, is ugly.\u201dBecause of an editing error, the Borja Journal article on Monday, about the odd celebrity enjoyed by an amateur painter in Spain after she botched the restoration of a church fresco showing Jesus with a crown of thorns, gave an incorrect translation for the fresco\u2019s title, \u201cEcce Homo,\u201d which refers to the words spoken by Pontius Pilate when he presented Jesus to his accusers. It means \u201cbehold the man\u201d \u2014 not \u201cbehold man.\u201d Because of another editing error, a picture caption with the article misspelled part of the title of the fresco as \u201cEcco Homo.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Are the Best Jobs Numbers in Months, Maybe Years", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Jobs ReportMerry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah from your friends at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The November jobs numbers from the federal agency, released Friday morning, are the best all-around news about the state of the American economy in months, and maybe years. Indeed, it is in the details of what make this report a good one that you find evidence for momentum in the economy.In short, for the last couple of years, there has been great progress in reducing the unemployment rate, but it was accomplished in part because people left the job market, and it was not accompanied by any meaningful gains in wages.There have been anecdotal hints for months that employers are facing new pressure to raise workers\u2019 wages as the job market has gotten tighter. And Friday\u2019s report is the first piece of real evidence in the official government data that it\u2019s happening.In November, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.8 percent, but almost all the other measures of the labor market pointed to an improving composition of the job market: Employers added more positions, and at higher hourly wages. If the November trend is sustained, the unemployment rate may not fall much in the months ahead, but Americans will be a lot happier.The numbers are these: The 321,000 payroll jobs added represent the best monthly result since January 2012. Revisions to September and October counts add a net 44,000 positions, boosting those months\u2019 results from \u201csolid\u201d to \u201cpretty good.\u201dOver the last three months the nation has added an average of 278,000 jobs a month, the best result since the 2008 recession except for a brief boom caused by census hiring in 2010.But what was warming the hearts of many jaded economy-watchers on Twitter Friday morning were the numbers on wages.Average hourly wages rose 0.4 percent, and the average length of the workweek for private-sector workers ticked up to 34.6 hours, from 34.5. Add it all up, and an index of weekly payrolls rose a whopping 0.9 percent in November, which is the kind of monthly swing that rarely happens.The usual caveats have to come into play here. It\u2019s one month. It will be revised multiple times. There is a wide error band around these numbers, and all this may turn out to be an aberration. Average hourly earnings are still up only 2.1 percent over a year earlier, just barely faster than inflation.And, lest we get too cheery, it\u2019s worth at least pointing out a weaker spot in the report. The survey of households on which the unemployment rate is based painted a more stagnant picture of the economic situation, with the proportion of the population in the labor force and the proportion of the population with a job both unchanged.It will take many more months of above-trend gains in hourly wages to conclude that workers are finally starting to accrue the benefits of an expansion that is in its sixth year. But the November data is a nice start that should make people feel better about the state of the economy heading into 2015.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the location of the L.L.

{"Headline": "Obama Defends Actions on Cuba and Promises Some Compromise With Congress", "Date": "2014-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Friday rejected criticism that he should not have reopened American relations with Cuba because of the nation\u2019s human rights record, saying the historic thaw would give the United States more sway over the Cuban government.\u201cI share the concerns of dissidents there and human rights activists that this is still a regime that represses its people,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a wide-ranging news conference after a period of extraordinary domestic and foreign policy changes at the White House.But even as he acknowledged that Cuba might take actions the United States opposes, Mr. Obama said, \u201cThe whole point of normalizing relations is that it gives us a greater opportunity to have influence with that government.\u201d\u201cChange is going to come to Cuba,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to.\u201dAs in previous years, the president used his annual late-December news conference to make the case that his policies had helped the economy and burnished the United States\u2019 reputation around the world. \u201cWe\u2019ve set the stage for this American moment,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to spend every minute of my last two years making sure that we seize it.\u201dMr. Obama was upbeat in the nearly hourlong exchange with the news media, in which he called only on women. It was his last public event before departing Friday for a vacation with his family in Hawaii. He said he had shown that he could tackle steep challenges, including the fight against the Islamic State militant group, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and a mass migration of unaccompanied minors from Central America across the border. Mr. Obama vowed to seek compromise with Republicans in Congress where possible, such as on a tax overhaul and rebuilding infrastructure, but pledged to veto efforts to roll back his health care law and financial regulations.\u201cI intend to continue to do what I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people, and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, I\u2019m going to do it.\u201dStill, the president acknowledged that he would have to work with Congress on contentious issues, including lifting the 54-year-old American trade embargo against Cuba. \u201cWe cannot unilaterally bring down the embargo,\u201d he said, although his administration is undertaking a major effort to loosen key elements.\u201cUltimately, we need to go ahead and pull down the embargo, which I think has been self-defeating in advancing the aims that we\u2019re interested in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t anticipate that that happens right away.\u201dWhile he said he had no plans to visit Cuba in the near term, he recounted friendly moments during a telephone call this week with President Ra\u00fal Castro. He said the two had joked about being long-winded and about Fidel Castro, Ra\u00fal\u2019s brother.After Mr. Obama apologized for speaking for so long during the call, he said, Mr. Castro told him, \u201cYou\u2019re still a young man, and you have still the chance to break Fidel\u2019s record: He once spoke seven hours straight.\u201dThen, Mr. Obama added, the Cuban president proceeded to speak for twice as long as he had.Closer to home, Mr. Obama told reporters he was eager to compromise with the new Republican-controlled Congress, including on revamping the nation\u2019s tax system, which he said he would push to make simpler and fairer. \u201cI want to work with this new Congress to get things done,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to disagree on some things, but there are going to be areas of agreement, and we\u2019ve got to be able to make that happen, and that\u2019s going to involve compromise once in a while.\u201dMr. Obama said he would push to change rules that allow \u201ccorporate inversions,\u201d when American companies move their headquarters \u201con paper\u201d to another country in order to avoid taxes.He reminded Republicans that they would also have to consider his priorities. \u201cIn order for their initiatives to become law, I\u2019m going to have to sign off,\u201d he said, \u201cand that means they have to take into account the issues that I care about, just as I\u2019m going to take into account the issues that they care about.\u201dMr. Obama refused to say what he would do if Congress tried to force his hand on approving the Keystone XL pipeline, saying only, \u201cI\u2019ll see what they do.\u201dBut he played down the advantages of the pipeline and said he wanted to make sure it would not accelerate climate change. \u201cThere\u2019s been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula to what ails the U.S. economy, and it\u2019s hard to see on paper where exactly they\u2019re getting that information,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama said he would seek to carry out quickly the recommendations of a task force he named this week on law enforcement and race relations, some of them by executive order and some by legislation. The public conversation set off by the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of white police officers in places like Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island is healthy, he said, adding that he was willing to take on big problems.\u201cMy presidency is entering the fourth quarter,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cInteresting stuff happens in the fourth quarter, and I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dMichael D.

These new services let you use your own mobile devices, like tablets, laptops and phones, to either stream free content like TV, music or games, or to rent movies and TV without having to pay for a Wi-Fi plan.Delta Air Lines\u2019 new Delta Studio service, for example, relies on Gogo. The service, released in August, is available to all passengers on any flight over 90 minutes, letting them stream satellite TV, music and video games on a personal device without paying for a Wi-Fi plan. When you open a browser window on your laptop, tablet or phone, you\u2019ll see a menu that offers movies and TV to stream or rent.What you see is based on where you\u2019re sitting. (You\u2019ll be asked for your name and seat number when you sign in.) So-called premium movies and TV are free for first, business and upgraded economy class, but Delta said coach passengers get at least something free, and can pay $6 for additional movies and $1 for TV shows.If you want to surf the web or check email, though, you\u2019ll still have to pay for Wi-Fi. And be aware that to get the free streamed content, you must download Gogo\u2019s video player app before boarding the flight.Alaska Airlines this week announced a similar service, also powered by Gogo, that will let fliers rent movies and TV even if a separate Wi-Fi subscription isn\u2019t available on the flight.The airline is still deploying the faster Wi-Fi throughout its fleet; it said just under half its planes offer the faster Internet options. A JetBlue spokeswoman said the rollout would be complete in spring 2015. If you\u2019re on a flight with Fly-Fi, you can get basic web access free, or upgrade to even faster Internet access for $9 an hour. Those prices may change after the entire fleet has the technology.That\u2019s expensive, but I\u2019ve paid as much or more for Gogo\u2019s in-flight Wi-Fi and had it work at a crawling pace. If you really wanted to stream a movie from Netflix, the cost might be worth it.Personally, I\u2019d rather watch the live TV on the seat back, but maybe a Fox series would suffice if the TV signal became choppy.Many airlines are finding that offering better in-flight Wi-Fi and a few free content options is easier and cheaper than upgrading expensive seats to include seat-back TVs. And a few free offerings go a long way, especially in coach.\u201cOther than pouring us endless martinis, that\u2019s just about the only thing they can do to keep us happy in flight,\u201d said Jack Plunkett, chief executive of Plunkett Research, a market research firm based in Houston.Mr. Plunkett said airlines were slow to jump into in-flight technology after the industry\u2019s first major attempt \u2014 the seat-back telephone \u2014 proved a \u201cdismal failure.\u201d\u201cIt added a lot of weight to the airplane, drew a lot of power and required a communications system connecting the airplane to a comm system on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that failure, it was hard to talk them into trying Wi-Fi on board.\u201dBut as personal devices like phones, tablets and laptops became more and more common, and third-party Wi-Fi providers offered to shoulder the cost of in-flight Internet access, airlines realized that the \u201cbring your own device\u201d model of in-flight entertainment could be cheap and easy.And instead of replacing entire seats to add entertainment, airlines are adding welcome niceties like power outlets and USB plugs in every row. So, using in-flight Wi-Fi to stream a movie to a plugged-in tablet becomes a better way to fly.Southwest Airlines, always bare bones in terms of its actual planes, offers Wi-Fi on about 80 percent of its flights. While the company said its smaller aircraft would not be retrofitted for Wi-Fi, any new jets that come into the fleet will have it.Southwest also includes live Dish satellite TV and Beats Music playlists without requiring passengers to pay for a Wi-Fi plan, and said it was the only airline that offered wireless Internet access during taxiing, before takeoff and after landing.In the coming years, expect in-flight Wi-Fi to continue to get faster \u2014 and hopefully cheaper. Virgin America announced this week that it had upgraded its in-flight Wi-Fi, provided by Gogo Inflight, to up to 10 megabits per second, close to a typical home broadband connection. The connections in-flight will probably be slower, because everyone is sharing the Wi-Fi, but that is still an improvement.And Gogo said that it was testing satellite-based Wi-Fi, instead of the current ground-to-air system, and that could provide a plane with a connection of 70 megabits per second. Even shared among passengers on a plane, that would be speedy Internet.A few carriers are, of course, slower to upgrade than others. United, for example, offers Wi-Fi access on only about half of its jets, although it just announced plans to bring Wi-Fi and Gogo-powered personal device streaming to some of its smaller United Express planes starting early next year. About 200 of its 700 planes offer seat-back entertainment.American Airlines offers Wi-Fi on all its big jets, but only on 12 percent of its regional planes, and it has some kind of seat-back entertainment in 58 percent of its wide-body jets, the company said.And then there\u2019s the domestic in-flight dream: Virgin America, often lauded as having the best domestic in-flight system of them all. Yes, every flight has (newly upgraded) Wi-Fi, power outlets and USB ports.But every plane also has seat-back TVs that stream live television and offer on-demand movies and TV (free to Main Cabin Select and first-class passengers). The TVs serve as touch-screen ordering systems for food and drinks, which are then delivered directly to your seat. You can use them to play games and chat with other passengers, and Virgin America just introduced a new feature that lets you send a drink to another passenger on the plane.Such seat-back amenities might not be practical to maintain forever, especially as personal devices and faster in-flight Internet access become cheaper and easier to deploy. But for now, the best of all worlds is still the best option.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Onetime Dropout Crashes the Small, Sedate Midsize Truck Party", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel9 PhotosAutomakers routinely try to create new segments, hoping an unusual vehicle will find a fresh set of customers. But with the 2015 Chevrolet Colorado, General Motors is aiming at an old segment that\u2019s been largely abandoned and forgotten: the midsize pickup. And G.M. is betting there are buyers who want the utility of a pickup in a somewhat smaller package than the full-size Chevy Silverado.It is a disruptive move, threatening the friendly complacency that has lately characterized the segment, inhabited of late by only two elderly, genteel competitors: the Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier. The Tacoma and Frontier were new for the 2005 model year, and there hasn\u2019t been much incentive to modernize since in 2011 Ford stopped building the Ranger and Chrysler discontinued the Dakota. \u201cHere we are, crashing their party,\u201d said Brad Schreiber, the engineer responsible for the ride and handling of the new Colorado and its sibling, the GMC Canyon.The last-generation Colorado, a disappointing vehicle with such a poor structure that the pickup bed waggled, was developed largely by Isuzu. Introduced as a 2004 model, it was discontinued after the 2012 model year and is only now being replaced.The 2015 model is available as either an extended cab or crew cab with either 5-foot-2 or 6-foot-2 bed lengths.Engine choices are a 200-horsepower 2.5-liter 4 cylinder or a 3.6-liter V6 rated at 305 horsepower. A 6-speed manual is available on the least expensive models; everything else gets a 6-speed automatic.There are rear-wheel and 4-wheel-drive models. But the 4-wheel drive is a part-time system designed for use only on slippery surfaces.The least expensive \u201cBase\u201d model has an extended cab, the shorter bed, rear-wheel drive and the 6-speed manual transmission. It is $20,995 including the $875 shipping charge. Consumers seeking a less plain but fiscally conservative approach can choose the LT trim. With an extended cab, the longer bed, rear-wheel drive, the 4-cylinder engine and 6-speed automatic, the price is $26,045. Four-wheel drive adds $4,050, which means that for $30,095 the Colorado buyer still gets a 4-cylinder engine. The V6 costs $1,235 more. I tested a Crew Cab LT with the long bed, 4-wheel drive, V6 and automatic transmission, for a starting price of $33,260. Options included heated seats, 18-inch wheels, leather interior, upgraded stereo, remote start, navigation system, lane departure alerts and collision warning as well as a fully automatic locking rear differential. The total came to $38,870. That may seem like a big window sticker for a midsize pickup. But it is easy to miss how expensive full-size pickups have become. A comparably equipped Chevy Silverado V6 can easily cost $7,000 more.In addition to price, there is quite a difference in size. The largest Colorado is the Crew Cab with the long bed and an overall length of 224.9 inches \u2014 nearly 15 inches shorter than a comparable Silverado. All Colorados are 5.7 inches narrower than the Silverado. So, unlike a full-size pickup, the Colorado feels tidy, maneuverable and piece-of-cake easy to place in its lane. It is also eager, by truck standards, to head into a turn. The steering has a nice weight, and when the Colorado is going straight there is none of the truckish on-center looseness that can undermine driver confidence. Indeed, the Colorado can be aimed through a turn, and it follows directions without any fiddling corrections. The feel of the brake pedal is so good it would be appropriate in a sport sedan.The ride is comfortable for a body-on-frame truck, and even on broken roads the Colorado feels incredibly solid, a tremble-free zone. That reflects the extensive use of high- and ultra-high-strength steel.The Colorado is based on new underpinnings, including an independent front suspension and solid rear axle. \u201cEverything from the suspension to frame to body structure is new,\u201d said Mr. Schreiber, the ride-and-handling engineer. The engines and transmissions are borrowed from elsewhere in the G.M. family. The automatic transmission was a disappointment. It was often slow to react, as if trying to figure out what it was supposed to do. At times, it wasn\u2019t clear why it shifted gears; occasionally, a shift was harsh.When a quick response was needed, the V6 didn\u2019t help much partly because its peak torque \u2014 269 pound-feet \u2014 wasn\u2019t reached until 4,000 r.p.m. But once the correct gear was selected \u2014 after the automatic\u2019s pause for deliberation \u2014 the engine dealt adequately, if noisily, with the truck\u2019s 4,450 pounds of bulk.The fuel economy for the tested version isn\u2019t great. The government rating is 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 m.p.g. on the highway. A Silverado with a 5.3 liter V8, 4-wheel drive and 6-speed automatic is rated only 1 m.p.g. lower in town and 2 lower on the highway.The 4-cylinder doesn\u2019t provide much improvement. A Colorado with 4-wheel drive and 6-speed automatic is rated at 19 m.p.g. city and 25 highway. Next year, G.M. will offer a 2.8-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel rated at 181 horsepower with 369 pound-feet of torque at an accessible 2,000 r.p.m. The automaker has not offered fuel-economy estimates for that engine. For the tested truck, General Motors rates the payload , which is the maximum recommended weight of passengers and cargo, at 1,520 pounds. That\u2019s only 190 pounds less than a 4-wheel-drive Silverado Crew Cab with a 5.3 liter V8, 6-foot-6 bed and 4-wheel drive. The Colorado I tested was rated to tow 7,000 pounds because it was equipped with the optional $250 trailering package, which also requires the locking rear differential for an additional $325. The standard rating is 3,500 pounds.Whether carrying or towing, pickups are all about practicality, and that emphasis continues with the Colorado\u2019s interior. There are plenty of trays and storage bins, and G.M. has embraced the simplicity of the knob for some controls. But there are also hard plastic surfaces one would not expect in a truck that costs almost $39,000. Also, even in the Crew Cab, a 6-foot adult seated in back is likely to be cramped. One nice feature is a standard backup camera even on the least expensive model.While flawed by the transmission and so-so fuel economy, the Colorado, and the identical-performing Canyon, offer satisfying handling, relative affordability as well as adequate towing and cargo capacity.And it appears there are plenty of people who still like midsize pickups: About 8.3 million are still registered in the United States, according to an analysis by Experian Automotive. About 528,000 of those are the old Colorado, suggesting that the previous version was less than a sales success.\u201cThat truck was less than what we hoped it would be,\u201d said Mr. Schreiber, the engineer. \u201cI think we want to put the previous generation behind us and distance ourselves from that truck.\u201dIndeed, G.M. has put light years between the old and new Colorados. The latest truck should be a bombshell in the midsize pickup segment.Some of those shock waves are already embarrassing a full-size competitor, the all-new 2015 Ford F-150. Last week, Motor Trend magazine picked the Colorado as its Truck of the Year, an honor that many in the industry had expected to go to the aluminum-body F-150, which Ford has been promoting as a breakthrough model. The editors at Motor Trend praised the Colorado for features including versatility, handling, fuel economy and value.\u00a0But Chevrolet shouldn\u2019t get too cocky; the midsize game isn\u2019t over, and it may just be starting to get interesting. Toyota will introduce a new Tacoma next month at the Detroit auto show.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edith Ramirez Is Raising the F.T.C.\u2019s Voice", "Date": "2014-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The New England Journal of Medicine is not a common venue for antitrust debates. But it was in that academic journal that Edith Ramirez, chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, warned this month that mergers of physician practice groups could stifle competition.The essay was vintage Ramirez: precise, astute and quietly forceful, particularly when expounding on the commission\u2019s authority. The essay was also the latest example of Ms. Ramirez flashing the agency\u2019s regulatory teeth.\u201cExtensive evidence that consolidation of health care providers leads to higher prices without corresponding improvements in quality,\u201d she wrote, \u201csupports the F.T.C.\u2019s continued vigilance over these markets.\u201dMs. Ramirez\u2019s efforts could lead to more turf battles, including with the F.C.C. and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which see their mandates as covering much of the same enforcement territory. The agencies say publicly that they are working well together and just divvying up the spoils. Behind the scenes, though, more than a little tension has developed.Ms. Ramirez, described by colleagues as a reserved yet diligent litigator, will be at the center of that turf battle, her calm demeanor masking an aggressive negotiator.\u201cWe are engaging in a conversation with folks in the industry, academics, technologists and consumer advocates so we can keep abreast of emerging challenges,\u201d Ms. Ramirez said in a recent interview, one of the few she has granted since she became chairwoman in March 2013. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure we are where consumers are, so we can have an impact.\u201dIn person, Ms. Ramirez, 46, is soft-spoken, and can sometimes be slightly stilted in addressing a large audience. At early appearances after taking over as chairwoman, she was often whisked away by staff members, smiling nervously but refusing to answer questions from news media.A recent news conference that featured both Ms. Ramirez and Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., was a study in contrasts. Mr. Wheeler\u2019s remarks seemed entirely impromptu, with minimal looking at notes, while Ms. Ramirez read a prepared three-page statement.\u201cShe may be quiet but she\u2019s extremely strategic and dedicated,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group. \u201cShe is very aware of the central role that consumer protection will play as the U.S. is transformed by the digital economy.\u201dMs. Ramirez grew up in Southern California, in one of a few nonwhite families in her small beach town of San Clemente. Her parents immigrated from Mexico and the family spoke Spanish at home. High expectations were the rule, she said in the interview, in her typically understated manner. Her parents, she said, \u201calways wanted us to do our best, let\u2019s say.\u201d\u201cAt home, I was always conscious of having a culture different from mainstream culture,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it made me more conscious of others who might be outside the mainstream.\u201dShe thrived, however, at Harvard, earning a degree in history magna cum laude before entering law school, where she served on the staff of The Harvard Law Review with Barack Obama. She returned to California, clerking at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals before beginning a career as an appellate and antitrust lawyer in Los Angeles.Since being appointed as one of five F.T.C. commissioners in 2010, she has often spoken about the particular importance for low-income families of consumer protection and competition. At a competition forum in the Dominican Republic in 2012, she noted that while the poor, like everyone else, benefited from competition, \u201cthe underprivileged may benefit even more because they spend a greater proportion of their income on basic goods and services.\u201dAs an example, she cites mobile phone service. Low-income consumers are far more likely than more affluent Americans to rely on cellphones for their only telephone connection. And in recent months, the F.T.C. has put a particularly strong focus on the mobile companies.The evolution of digital services is one that holds both promise and peril for consumers, Ms. Ramirez said, from mobile phones that constantly track users\u2019 whereabouts to the so-called Internet of Things, a world where most every home device and appliance will have some type of Internet-connected sensor.\u201cToday\u2019s currency is data,\u201d Ms. Ramirez said. \u201cWe want to see all this innovation that is giving us these marvelous services. But in order to achieve what those types of services can offer us, we need to have consumer protections in place so consumers can feel confident when using those products.\u201dUnder Ms. Ramirez, the F.T.C. also has cracked down on companies that allowed minors to make in-app purchases without a parent\u2019s permission. Apple agreed to refund $32.5 million and Google $19 million; Amazon is contesting similar F.T.C. charges.Still, Ms. Ramirez knows the uphill climb she faces to raise the commission\u2019s profile. In her 2010 confirmation hearing, Ms. Ramirez said \u201cmost everyday Americans really don\u2019t know much about what the F.T.C. does.\u201dIt is a problem, she said recently, that continued to be a work in progress.\u201cOne of our principal aims,\u201d she said, \u201cis to make sure we are active in areas where we can have the greatest impact for consumers, that we address the problems that affect them in their day-to-day lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Robots Grow Smarter, American Workers Struggle to Keep Up", "Date": "2014-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonemployedAlthough fears that technology will displace jobs are at least as old as the Luddites, there are signs that this time may really be different. The technological breakthroughs of recent years \u2014 allowing machines to mimic the human mind \u2014 are enabling machines to do knowledge jobs and service jobs, in addition to factory and clerical work.Economists long argued that, just as buggy-makers gave way to car factories, technology would create as many jobs as it destroyed. Now many are not so sure.Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at M.I.T., said, \u201cThis is the biggest challenge of our society for the next decade.\u201dMr. Brynjolfsson and other experts say they believe that society has a chance to meet the challenge in ways that will allow technology to be mostly a positive force. In addition to making some jobs obsolete, new technologies have also long complemented people\u2019s skills and enabled them to be more productive \u2014 as the Internet and word processing have for office workers or robotic surgery has for surgeons.More productive workers, in turn, earn more money and produce goods and services that improve lives. \u201cIt is literally the story of the economic development of the world over the last 200 years,\u201d said Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and an inventor of the web browser. \u201cJust as most of us today have jobs that weren\u2019t even invented 100 years ago, the same will be true 100 years from now.\u201dYet there is deep uncertainty about how the pattern will play out now, as two trends are interacting. Artificial intelligence has become vastly more sophisticated in a short time, with machines now able to learn, not just follow programmed instructions, and to respond to human language and movement.Self-driving vehicles are an example of the crosscurrents. They could put truck and taxi drivers out of work \u2014 or they could enable drivers to be more productive during the time they used to spend driving, which could earn them more money. But for the happier outcome to happen, the drivers would need the skills to do new types of jobs.The challenge is evident for white-collar jobs, too. Ad sales agents and pilots are two jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects will decline in number over the next decade. Flying a plane is largely automated today and will become more so. And at Google, the biggest seller of online ads, software does much of the selling and placing of search ads, meaning there is much less need for salespeople.IBM, like many tech companies, says Watson is assisting people, not replacing them, and enabling them to be more productive in new types of jobs. It will be years before we know what happens to the counselors, salespeople, chefs, paralegals and researchers whose jobs Watson is learning to do.Perhaps the most worrisome development is how poorly the job market is already functioning for many workers. More than 16 percent of men between the ages of 25 and 54 are not working, up from 5 percent in the late 1960s; 30 percent of women in this age group are not working, up from 25 percent in the late 1990s. For those who are working, wage growth has been weak, while corporate profits have surged.\u201cWe\u2019re going to enter a world in which there\u2019s more wealth and less need to work,\u201d Mr. Brynjolfsson said. \u201cThat should be good news. But if we just put it on autopilot, there\u2019s no guarantee this will work out.\u201dSome say the nature of work will need to change. Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, recently suggested a four-day workweek, so as technology displaces jobs, more people can find employment. Others believe the role of the public sector should expand, to help those struggling to find work. Many point to education, in new technologies and in the skills that remain uniquely human, like creativity and judgment.\u201cThe answer is surely not to try to stop technical change,\u201d Mr. Summers said, \u201cbut the answer is not to just suppose that everything\u2019s going to be O.K. because the magic of the market will assure that\u2019s true.\u201dNonemployed: Articles in this series examine the\ndecline of work in the United\nStates and its consequences for individuals\nand society.Advertisement"}

Days after the 17-year-old received the Nobel Peace Prize for advocating girls\u2019 right to education, the Taliban launched the deadliest attack in Pakistan\u2019s history, killing at least 148 people, including 132 children, at a school in Peshawar.The people of Pakistan are shaken, angry, confused and fearful. The government just lifted the moratorium on the death penalty. And yet the attack in Peshawar will not be Pakistan\u2019s 9/11 moment. Terrorist attacks against schools in tribal areas are an old story. Muhammad Khorasani, the spokesman of the Pakistani Taliban (also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban), said the Peshawar attack was retaliation for the deaths of civilians killed in Operation Zarb-e-Azb, an anti-militancy campaign the Pakistani military started in June. Whatever measure the government takes, the militants seem undeterred. Another, and greater, problem is that the Pakistani government is fundamentally ambivalent about the need to eradicate all militant groups. The National Counterterrorism Authority, the agency tasked with coordinating the government\u2019s antiterrorism policy and its implementation, has been largely ineffectual. Just this week a court granted bail to Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the suspected mastermind behind the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Although Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Gen. Raheel Sharif, the army chief, have promised to go after all types of terrorists, no such consensus actually exists within the government. Rather, Pakistan\u2019s leaders want to keep at least some militants around to fight India and re-establish some influence in Afghanistan. Even as the Pakistani military was conducting its anti-Taliban offensive in North Waziristan in recent months, it refrained from going after the Haqqani Network, an insurgent group that staged several attacks in Afghanistan this summer, or the thousands of militants in Punjab and Sindh who the military thinks might one day serve as proxy fighters against India.One popular narrative distinguishes these various terrorist groups according to three broad categories: those fighting other sectarian groups in Pakistan, those fighting in Afghanistan and those fighting in India. But these differences are illusive. Lashkar-e-Taiba, whose primary purpose is to challenge India\u2019s control over Kashmir, also calls for jihad generally: Its supporters leave graffiti in streets throughout Pakistan calling for war against the United States and the West. Sipah-e-Sahaba, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jaish-e-Muhammad are revivalist Sunni groups that call for the establishment of a Shariah-based political system, but they multitask, too. All are tolerated by the government. Jaish-e-Muhammad, which is known to cultivate links with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, is allowed to run madrasas in South Punjab and to produce literature that calls for killing religious minorities and burning alleged blasphemers. Hafiz Saeed, the leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba, has appeared on television advocating jihad against India.The party of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the PML-N, is accused of maintaining close ties with the leaders of Punjab-based militants. The opposition PTI is seen as a Taliban sympathizer: Its leader, Imran Khan, said at a political rally earlier this year that the Taliban \u201cdid not want to enforce Shariah in the country at gunpoint,\u201d but \u201cwanted to liberate it from the U.S. war,\u201d according to Dawn, a Pakistani newspaper. The power base of the PPP, the social-democrat party of the Bhutto-Zardari clan, includes right-wing politicians and their militant partners in the southern province of Sindh.More important, none of these political actors has the strength to challenge the military\u2019s policy of tolerating terrorist groups that are hostile to India. The army\u2019s position seems not to flag even after Taliban attacks against the children of military personnel: It is simply too apprehensive of India\u2019s growing contacts in Afghanistan, and thinks that having militant proxies in Afghanistan is the only way to influence Kabul\u2019s political future. (Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the former military dictator and president, has even blamed India for the killings in Peshawar.) But this run-with-the-hare-and-hunt-with-the-hounds approach has allowed Al Qaeda to reinvent itself in the region. The head of Al Qaeda in the Indian subcontinent reportedly is an Indian who trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan with terrorist groups friendly with the military. When Pakistan\u2019s leaders profess helplessness in the face of the country\u2019s militancy problem, they tend to bemoan institutional limitations: Pakistan\u2019s judiciary and law enforcement are not designed, equipped or prepared to fight extremism. But that argument skirts the central issue, which is that the attitude of the power elites toward terrorist groups is opportunistic. If Pakistan wants to save its children from death and destruction, its leaders will first have to agree that the primary threat to the state is militancy, in any version. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lower Economic Growth Forecast in Texas May Keep Billions From State Budget", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 An obscure committee of state lawmakers met at the Texas Capitol this week to approve an arcane measure with big consequences.With no debate, the Legislative Budget Board selected 11.68 percent as its forecast of how much the Texas economy will grow over the next two years, even though several economic analysts have predicted the figure could be as high as 16 percent. The number is significant because under the Texas Constitution, the official growth rate sets the limit on how much a portion of the budget for the next two years can increase from the current one. By selecting the lowest figure among multiple estimates, the Budget Board may have cut off budget writers from billions of dollars in available revenue. \u201cWe may very well end up this session with more revenue than what the state could spend under the cap,\u201d said Dale Craymer, president of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more revenue thanks largely to what\u2019s going on in the oil and gas industry.\u201dThe Budget Board\u2019s decision quickly drew criticism from both ends of the political spectrum, but for opposite reasons. Yet for Dick Lavine, a senior fiscal analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, the Budget Board\u2019s pick was shortsighted and may not allow the state to pay for necessary services or improvements. \u201cThey could have left themselves the room,\u201d Mr. Lavine said. \u201cNow you\u2019ve already set the cap low enough that you may not be able to do what you want to do six months from now.\u201dThe spending cap is more complicated and less comprehensive than its simple name suggests. According to the Texas Constitution, spending from state tax revenue that is not mandated by the Constitution cannot \u201cexceed the estimated rate of growth of the state\u2019s economy.\u201d Federal spending, which makes up more than a third of the budget, is not subject to the cap. Neither are big pots of revenue like the state gas tax. In all likelihood, less than half of the budget lawmakers approve next year will fall under the cap. Yet the part of the budget that is subject to the cap generally overlaps the portion over which lawmakers have the most discretion, and includes most state spending on public schools. A majority of the House and Senate can allow budget writers to spend beyond the cap, but Republican lawmakers in particular are loath to support such a vote. Democrats have warned that a lower cap could make it difficult for the Legislature to tackle high-profile shortfalls in some areas, including transportation and education.\u201cThose are all big-ticket items, and the question will be whether we will have sufficient dollars to meet the state\u2019s priorities under the spending cap we have set,\u201d said Representative Sylvester Turner, Democrat of Houston.Mr. Turner, one of two Democrats on the 10-member Budget Board, said the board should have approved a higher spending cap, though he voted with the board\u2019s majority because the outcome was inevitable.\u201cThis was not the time for a person like me to wage my battle,\u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cIf I choose to engage in a battle, I want to engage in a battle that realistically I think I can win.\u201dA similar focus on the spending cap could unfold during next year\u2019s session, as a strong Texas economy is expected to once again keep state coffers full.\u201cWe\u2019ve had sort of a perfect storm of an incredibly deep recession with an incredibly robust recovery,\u201d Mr. Craymer said. Many conservative lawmakers and groups are hopeful that the spending cap will become more restrictive. They have called for amending the Constitution to peg the cap to the combined rates in inflation and population growth rather than the current approach, which uses the growth in average state personal income as a proxy for the overall growth in the state economy.Mr. Heflin said the Consumer Price Index was an appropriate metric to use because it is one most voters could comprehend.\u201cWe want it to be as understandable and as transparent as possible, and that\u2019s one of the reasons we stay with C.P.I.,\u201d Mr. Heflin said. \u201cI know the argument can be made that that is not the best indicator.\u201dThe focus on state population growth could also be misleading, said Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities.\u201cWhat population are we talking about?\u201d she said. \u201cThe school-age population? The 65-and-over population? The inmate population? There\u2019s growth in some populations that affect the budget more than others.\u201dBoth Mr. Perry and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst have previously called for tightening the state\u2019s spending cap. Their successors, Gov.-elect Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov.-elect Dan Patrick, have similar positions.The strong showing by Republicans during this year\u2019s elections suggests that tightening the spending cap could gain traction, Mr. Heflin said. Along with changing the way the cap is calculated, there is a growing interest in broadening the cap so it affects more of the budget.\u201cWe think to have a true cap on growth, it would need to apply to all funds, or at a minimum, all state funds,\u201d Mr. Heflin said. \u201cI think there is a good chance we will see some movement in that area this session.\u201dabatheja@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

It could be a cultural game changer in a city crowded with four significant private museums, two more on the way and three public ones all focused on contemporary art.With Mrs. Braman as co-chairwoman of its board, the plan is to build the museum on a lot in the Miami Design District donated by the real estate developer and fellow art collector Craig Robins, occupying 37,500 square feet across three floors. It will also have an adjoining 15,000-square-foot sculpture garden created by the Bramans\u2019 purchase (and imminent razing) of three neighboring homes. Its opening is timed for the Art Basel Miami Beach fair in December 2016, with the promise of significant art loans from the Braman collection. Just don\u2019t ask to see an actual budget.\u201cWe haven\u2019t even priced out the fire extinguisher system yet, because it doesn\u2019t use water so it won\u2019t damage the art,\u201d Mrs. Braman said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a bit of flying blind.\u201dThis might be cause for taxpayer alarm, but Mr. Braman, a fixture on Forbes\u2019s \u201c400 Wealthiest Americans\u201d list \u2014 which estimates his current net worth at nearly $2 billion from his auto dealerships, his former ownership of the Philadelphia Eagles, and one of the most impressive art collections in the country \u2014 insisted that \u201cnot one cent of taxpayer dollars are going into the construction, or the acquisition of properties for the sculpture garden, or anything.\u201dWith estimated annual operating expenses of $5 million, the Bramans say they already have commitments from other private backers to ensure the museum\u2019s first decade of operation. Mr. Braman waves off concerns about funding an endowment. \u201cIf an institution has not made it after 10 years, it shouldn\u2019t be around anymore,\u201d he said.The Bramans\u2019 insistence on footing the bill contrasts starkly with the shaky fiscal health of several local museums. While the P\u00e9rez\u2019s attendance and museum memberships have exceeded initial projections, according to Michael Spring, director of Miami-Dade County\u2019s Department of Cultural Affairs \u2014 who called the museum\u2019s first year \u201ca rip-roaring success\u201d \u2014 its endowment stands at $14 million, well below its announced target of $70 million. The museum operates with a reduced staff and a permanent collection often seen as lackluster.This fall, the P\u00e9rez museum requested additional county funds to raise its annual subsidy to $4 million from its current $2.5 million, a request that fell on deaf ears amid a county budget crunch that saw both public librarians and the police facing layoffs. Critics noted the $100 million in construction money already provided by the county, as well as the marquee site donated by the City of Miami. Wasn\u2019t that enough?\u201cThe vast majority of cultural institutions in this community are supported through a blend of public and private funds,\u201d countered Thom Collins, the museum\u2019s director. \u201cThis is because they offer a broad public benefit, and people understand that.\u201dTo be sure, money continues to pour into Miami\u2019s real-estate-focused economy, as do prominent art world figures, including the New York \u00fcber-dealer Larry Gagosian and the Russian art patron Maria Baibakova, who both have homes here.Yet while many arrivals are quick to pose for Art Basel photographers, some museum trustees say these newcomers turn shy when it comes to writing checks to public museums. \u201cThe wealth in Miami, by and large, is used more for self-aggrandizement than civic support,\u201d observed Lang Baumgarten, a Miami Beach developer and former Miami Art Museum trustee who said that he donated $400,000 and artwork before its renaming. \u201cI wish the real money would step up to the plate.\u201dA lack of financial support led to the creation of the Institute of Contemporary Art, whose board previously managed the Museum of Contemporary Art, owned by the City of North Miami. After voters in the largely Haitian-American community rejected a $15 million bond issue to expand the Museum of Contemporary Art in 2012, its director, Bonnie Clearwater, left to head the Nova Southeastern University Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale. The fight over naming her successor mushroomed into bitter turmoil between museum board members and City Hall. A legal settlement last month ended with an entirely new city-appointed board at the museum.\u201cThe team that\u2019s reconstituted itself at MOCA seems to be going in a good direction,\u201d said Mr. Robins, who is providing the Institute with temporary rent-free exhibition space while doing double duty as a P\u00e9rez trustee. \u201cI hope the I.C.A. will motivate the people behind PAMM to do even better,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped to see more donations to support world-class art purchases.Mr. Spring denied any disappointment with the pace of fund-raising. \u201cThey\u2019re hitting their marks,\u201d he said.Still, the P\u00e9rez may be in danger of being overshadowed: Art lovers craving an encounter with contemporary masterworks mostly absent from local museums \u2014 where even 1980 often feels like ancient history \u2014 may find the Institute more to their liking. The P\u00e9rez recently trumpeted a donation of a Jasper Johns print. The Bramans own his seminal 1962 painting \u201cDiver,\u201d as well as blue-chip works by de Kooning, Rothko, Warhol and what is called the finest array of Calders still in private hands.The Bramans said that they look forward to lending many of their works to the institute. \u201cIf the curator and director of the museum want to have a show on the New York School of Artists, we\u2019d be very happy to cooperate,\u201d Mr. Braman said, referring to a hallowed era of Abstract Expressionists they\u2019ve avidly collected. He also dangled the possibility of donating some paintings \u201cin the future.\u201dNow 82, Mr. Braman recalled that he and his wife \u201csaid to ourselves: \u2018What\u2019s success all about? What\u2019s philanthropy all about? Let\u2019s think of our legacy, following in the footsteps of some great Americans like the Carnegies and the Mellons who used their wealth for quality purposes.' \u201dMr. Collins was asked if the P\u00e9rez had sought its own modern-day Mellon. Why not tap Ms. Baibakova, whose recent Art Basel party featured white truffles, which fetch roughly $200 an ounce? \u201cIf you could make those introductions for me, it would certainly take a lot of pressure off,\u201d he replied.Advertisement"}

Housing stock runs the gamut from one-bedroom apartments to five-bedroom homes on large plots.When Jasleen Monga, a manager for a Chase bank branch in the village of Ardsley in lower Westchester, was searching for a home for herself \u201cin a quiet and private neighborhood,\u201d she said she never expected to find anything affordable within easy reach of her job.She found it in Hartsdale, a hamlet some 20 miles north of Manhattan, known by many for its main commercial strip of Central Park Avenue. She stumbled on an area known as \u201cPoet\u2019s Corner,\u201d a cluster of Capes and other homes, some dating to the 1920s, arrayed on a grid of streets with names like Chaucer and Keats. Earlier this year, Ms. Monga bought a four-bedroom two-bath house for slightly below the asking price in the mid-$400,000s.It has a small yard, and more important, room for her two grown daughters to visit. \u201cI love the easy access to highways and to the city,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you want to take a walk in the woods, that\u2019s steps away.\u201dThe real estate stock, a mix of single-family homes and city-style co-op and rental apartments, is \u201cvery versatile in terms of what you can get for your price range,\u201d said Caryn Balamaci, an associate real estate broker at Julia B. Fee Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in Scarsdale. Buyers can find a condominium or co-op for around $250,000 or luxury homes in the $800,000-to-$900,000 range. One draw for newcomers is the row of apartment buildings near the train station, which range from stately brick buildings to modern condo complexes with amenities like swimming pools and terraces. Even so, the downtown area has suffered some setbacks in recent years, including major flooding from a nor\u2019easter in 2007 as well as the aftershocks of the economic meltdown.Paul J. Feiner, the town supervisor for Greenburgh, said that the East Hartsdale Avenue business district had a 50 percent vacancy rate at one point during the downturn; now, nearly all storefronts are occupied, and include a recently opened yogurt shop, a half-dozen restaurants, and a New York Sports Club fitness center.The turnover in retail leases has been positive for the community, he said. \u201cSome of the old businesses were really tired, and when 5 p.m. came around, they were closed.\u201d Now, though, merchants \u201ccan\u2019t be in a local downtown area and close up shop at 5 o\u2019clock,\u201d he said.A 20-year comprehensive plan by the Greenburgh town government is aimed at bringing more businesses to the area without clogging streets with unnecessary traffic, Mr. Feiner said.One sign that the local economy is picking up is the development of a 51-unit luxury rental complex on a rise overlooking the Scarsdale Golf Club. The developer, the Ted Weinberg Building Company, said the complex is expected to open by the summer of 2015.What You\u2019ll FindHartsdale straddles Central Park Avenue, part of a main north-south artery in lower Westchester that is known for car dealerships and big chain stores, although the stretch in Hartsdale includes Trader Joe\u2019s, the Asian grocer H-Mart and Mrs. Green\u2019s Natural Market. Off this main drag lies a variety of neighborhoods, each with a distinct feel, such as the parklike settings of Manor Woods or Windsor Park, and College Corners, a mix of older Tudors and colonial homes on winding streets bearing names like Harvard and Yale.The housing stock runs the gamut from one-bedroom apartments to five-bedroom homes on nearly an acre. Many of the apartment buildings are along a stretch of East Hartsdale Avenue between Central Park Avenue and the train station.What You\u2019ll PayAs of Dec. 1, there were 31 single-family homes and 13 condos on the market in the Hartsdale 10530 ZIP code in the Greenburgh school district, according to Adi Tamir, an associate broker with the Houlihan Lawrence real estate agency in Irvington. Single-family homes ranged from a four-bedroom 1956 ranch in need of renovation on a quarter of an acre for $385,000 to a renovated 1947 three-bedroom ranch with a heated swimming pool on nearly one acre for $1.2 million. Condos listed ranged from $219,000 for a one-bedroom one-bath apartment to $649,000 for a two-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath townhouse.The average sales price year to date was $550,000 for a single-family and $354,000 for a condo. There were 58 co-ops on the market, with an average sales price year to date of $178,999.\u201cYou can definitely get a lot more value for your money in Hartsdale\u201d than in many other neighboring towns, Ms. Tamir said.Average sales prices of single-family houses increased 9.1 percent from December 2013 to December 2014; condos increased 8.1 percent and co-ops 3.1 percent.As for rentals, a two-bedroom two-bath unit would range from $1,795 to $3,400, Ms. Tamir said.What To DoHartsdale has several parks and recreational centers, including the 123-acre Hart\u2019s Brook Park and Preserve off Ridge Road, with an array of walking trails, and the county\u2019s 236-acre Ridge Road Park nearby. Recreational facilities in the area that are open to residents include tennis courts and outdoor and indoor pools.A farmers market is held Saturdays from June through November at the train station, and Hartsdale also has one of the few working farms in lower Westchester, Westchester Greenhouses and Farm, at the corner of Secor Road and West Hartsdale Avenue, which during December does a brisk business in Christmas trees and holiday decorations.A restaurant row stretching up a hill from the station has places offering Turkish, Mexican, Chinese and Japanese cuisines; Harrys of Hartsdale, a bistro on East Hartsdale Avenue, is a local hangout.

Monthly passes are $249, and a one-way peak ticket, $11.25. Parking is available at a lot adjacent to the station.The HistoryHartsdale\u2019s origins date to before the Revolutionary era, when it was part of the manor of Philipsburg, the estate of the Dutch merchant Frederick Philipse. It was an important site in the Revolutionary War, evidenced by a 1732 house on Ridge Road that was the setting for strategic meetings between George Washington and the French general Rochambeau. The house was deeded to the Sons of the American Revolution by descendants of the former owner John Odell, an aide to Washington.An earlier version of a picture caption with this column misstated the telephone number for the property listing at 81 Rockledge Road, #81M. It is (917) 553-4889.Because of an editing error, the Living In column last Sunday, about Hartsdale, N.Y., omitted one school district serving the hamlet.

{"Headline": "Boardroom Quotas Won't Help Women", "Date": "2014-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s coalition government adopted a draft law two weeks ago requiring corporations to allocate at least 30 percent of supervisory board positions to women, starting in 2016. The bill will go to Parliament on Thursday and is widely expected to pass.Yet those cheering this decision as a major coup should hold the schnapps. Although the quota may somewhat improve corporate diversity in Europe\u2019s leading economy, there is little reason to think it will make any real difference for German women.At present, men occupy about 80 percent of boardroom positions in Germany\u2019s largest corporations; women hold only 22 percent of nonexecutive board positions in the 30 companies on its DAX stock exchange.One might assume that Chancellor Angela Merkel, the first female head of state of a country where women hold 37 percent of the seats in Parliament, would be a natural champion of boardroom quota laws. But Ms. Merkel has long opposed them; in 2011 she rejected a quota proposal, saying she wanted a more \u201cpragmatic solution.\u201dIndeed, it is political pragmatism, rather than ideology, that seems to underlie her change of heart: It wasn\u2019t until 2013, facing fierce opposition from members of her own party and seeking a united front ahead of elections, that Ms. Merkel\u2019s position shifted.The chancellor\u2019s initial skepticism was not unfounded. German corporations have a two-tiered board system: Nonexecutive (and less influential) \u201csupervisory bodies\u201d are staffed by outside advisers; full-time management boards oversee daily operations. The proposed quota will be restricted to supervisory bodies on which there is employee representation, which is the case at only about 100 of Germany\u2019s listed corporations. Thus the policy will affect only a modest share of the work force (though a further 3,500 midsize companies will be required to set their own board quotas).It\u2019s hard to see how this narrow mandate will significantly improve the prospects of the average female worker.Many European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, have adopted variations of a corporate board quota, albeit too recently to rigorously assess. A better test case is Norway, whose board quota law, passed in 2003, has required qualifying publicly listed companies to meet a 40 percent threshold for women since 2008. Studies of the Norwegian mandate offer little cause for optimism, however.One study by two University of Michigan economists, published in 2012 in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, concluded that, while Norway\u2019s quota policy raised female representation on the corporate boards to which it pertained, it ultimately \u201cimposed significant and costly constraints on Norwegian firms.\u201d The women who were brought on to corporate boards were younger and less experienced than their male colleagues; the economists found that those firms forced to increase women\u2019s representation experienced a statistically significant loss in market value compared with other companies that year.The German automakers Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler and Opel have threatened to move production out of the country rather than comply with the quota. Norway\u2019s experience suggests they might not be bluffing: According to the 2012 study, numerous Norwegian corporations changed their legal structure or incorporated outside the country to avoid compliance. In 2009, the number of public limited firms in Norway was less than \u201c70 percent of the number in 2001,\u201d the economists found, while the number of private limited firms, which were exempt from the quota, had increased by more than 30 percent.Similarly, conclusions presented in a more recent review, conducted by researchers in the United States and Norway, hardly make a ringing endorsement. Although women in the highest echelons of Norwegian firms were found to have benefited from quotas, there was \u201cno evidence that these gains at the very top trickled down.\u201dThe researchers also reported no narrowing of the wage gap or improvement in female representation in other leadership positions, and saw nothing to suggest that younger women had modified their education or career plans because of perceived new opportunities. (The study did note that women appointed to boards as a result of the quota were generally more qualified than their female predecessors.)Quota advocates may counter that it is far too early to condemn these policies as failures and that focusing on short-term results misses the point: The symbolism of raising women\u2019s corporate profiles justifies the regulation.But, as Katrin Albsteiger, a 31-year-old German legislator, has argued, quotas may actually \u2014 if unintentionally \u2014 send a damning message that outweighs the benefits of increased visibility: that women can\u2019t successfully compete in the workplace without government intervention. No one wants \u201cto be labeled the \u2018token woman,\"\u2019 Ms. Albsteiger wrote last month in a German political magazine; women \u201cknow that they can succeed\u201d on their own.No matter how skilled or hardworking, women admitted to boards in order to fulfill a quota are unlikely to be seen as equals whose presence at the table is merited. Indeed, it is impossible to know whether some Norwegian corporations lost money following the imposition of quotas because their new female hires were unqualified \u2014 or if fears that they might be were bad enough for investors. Worse, the placement of a few women in high-visibility roles could amount to little more than window-dressing that enables companies to sidestep more sustained reforms.Where gender parity in Germany is concerned, there are legitimate reasons for optimism. Across the country, more women ages 25 to 34 are earning higher degrees (30 percent in 2011, from 20 percent in 2000); the work-force participation rate for German women increased from 56 percent in 1990 to 72 percent in 2012, according to World Bank estimates.Board quotas may seem like a convenient shortcut to workplace equality, but they are not \u2014 nor are they a long-term solution. A distraction at best, they may undo women\u2019s historic gains by suggesting that we cannot succeed on our own. Surely that\u2019s not a legacy Ms. Merkel wants to leave behind.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Crisis Saps Economy, Belarus Replaces Premier", "Date": "2014-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus dismissed his prime minister and the head of the country\u2019s central bank on Saturday as part of a sweeping and unexpected government reorganization. The reorganization was announced in a statement posted on the website of the presidential administration, but it offered no official explanation. Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s chief of staff, Andrei V. Kobyakov, who had run the presidential administration since 2010, was named the new prime minister, replacing Mikhail Myasnikovich. Pavel Kallaur, one of the central bank\u2019s deputy chairmen, was named its head.In recent weeks, Belarus has been the most aggressive of any former Soviet republic in trying to fence off its economy from the problems in Russia, in part by imposing capital controls that include hefty fees on foreign currency purchases. Currencies throughout the former Soviet Union, including those in Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia, have come under pressure as a result of Russia\u2019s problems. And on Thursday, Mr. Lukashenko demanded that Russia settle all transactions with Belarus in dollars or euros. \u201cWe should have long ago demanded Russia pay us also in hard currency,\u201d the official government news agency, Belta, quoted Mr. Lukashenko as saying. Mr. Lukashenko is a strongman and former collective-farm boss who has been in office since 1994, and Belarus is generally ruled by his whim, backed up by occasionally heavy-handed use of the country\u2019s security services. In remarks quoted on Belta, Prime Minister Kobyakov said the new government would focus on addressing the financial challenges. \u201cWe should secure the progressive development of the Belarussian economy in order to prevent living standards of our people from worsening,\u201d he said. The new prime minister added: \u201cThe tasks that the Belarussian economy faces are obvious. The situation in the world is complicated, while, unfortunately, our economy depends a lot on foreign markets.\u201d Before becoming chief of staff, Mr. Kobyakov, 53, had served as ambassador to Russia. While Mr. Lukashenko had long been ostracized by the West because of his erratic nature and apparent disregard for human rights and civil liberties, his country has emerged in recent months as a useful neutral ground amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Minsk, the capital of Belarus, has served as the meeting place for negotiators seeking to forge a settlement among Russia, separatist leaders from eastern Ukraine and the Ukrainian government in Kiev. Since then, Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s relationship with Moscow has grown more tense. In recent months, as Russia barred the import of many European goods in retaliation for Western sanctions, some Russian officials accused Belarus of capitalizing on the dispute and repackaging European products for resale as if they were Belarussian.

Russia has been sending patrols of military aircraft over the Baltic Sea recently in what Lithuanians interpret as an attempt to intimidate them. Lithuanian growth, while still well above the eurozone average, has suffered.The euro, which Lithuania will officially adopt on Thursday, will not solve all those problems. But analysts and political leaders say it should grease commerce, eliminate money-changing costs and help develop new markets to the West.The new currency may even provide an extra measure of geopolitical security. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia may be more cautious in provoking a country that is a member not only of the European Union and NATO, but also the eurozone.The euro gives the country more freedom in negotiating business with Russia, said Valdas Adamkus, who was president of Lithuania for about a decade until 2009.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to accept the pressure of being a small country with a little currency,\u201d Mr. Adamkus said. \u201cNow we are members of the eurozone.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether such arguments will help the euro win more adherents in other eastern European countries that have yet to join, like Poland, whose relatively fast-growing economy would provide some badly needed dynamism to the currency bloc. In line with public opinion, Polish leaders are in no hurry to sign up. The eurozone\u2019s prestige could suffer further now that political turmoil in Greece is unsettling financial markets.Although most of the European Union\u2019s 28 member countries are obliged to adopt the euro, no additional countries are expected to join the currency bloc for at least several years.Even in Lithuania, enthusiasm about becoming the 19th country in the eurozone is not overwhelming. Recent polls show a majority in favor of adopting the euro, and as recently as September, polls showed most Lithuanians were against membership.From the start, the euro was the brainchild of political elites and has rarely been greeted with acclaim. Among the most enthusiastic adopters were the Greeks in 2001, when nearly two-thirds were in favor of joining. Especially now, when the currency bloc is still trying to overcome chronically meager growth, the advantages of membership are not always obvious.Many Lithuanians believe that \u201cwe are joining the losing club,\u201d said Ruslanas Irzikevicius, the pro-euro editor in chief of The Lithuania Tribune, an English-language news website. \u201cWe are joining the losing club and the problems in the eurozone will affect Lithuania\u2019s prospects.\" Mr. Irzikevicius emphasized that he was describing a widely held sentiment with which he personally disagrees.Euro membership is also costly. A study by Lithuania\u2019s central bank found that the changeover would cost 600 million euros, or about $731 million, through 2020 in contributions to the European Union budget, costs to commercial lenders and other expenses.That is a substantial sum in a country with three million people. \u201cBut if you compare with the benefits, the benefits are higher,\u201d Vitas Vasiliauskas, the chairman of the central bank, said in an interview on Tuesday. He predicted that popular support would rise as people get used to the new currency, as happened in neighboring Latvia and Estonia, which are already eurozone members.Mr. Vasiliauskas and other economists and political leaders argue that there are plenty of reasons for a country like Lithuania to join the common currency, despite the eurozone\u2019s stubbornly slow growth and waning prestige.The country\u2019s current currency, the litas, has been pegged to the euro for more than a decade. Lithuania tried to join the eurozone in 2007 but was rejected because its inflation rate was too high. Now that Lithuania will be in the eurozone, its banks can borrow money at favorable rates from the European Central Bank, and the country could resort to the eurozone bailout fund in a crisis. Those sources of emergency aid would have come in very handy in 2009, when international credit dried up and Lithuania suffered a severe recession.\u201cIf we had been accepted in 2007, this crisis of 2008 and 2009 would have been much easier,\u201d said Andrius Kubilius, leader of the Christian Democrat party in Lithuania, who was prime minister at the time.Lithuania will also gain a voice in eurozone monetary policy. Like all heads of national central banks in the eurozone, Mr. Vasiliauskas will become a member of the European Central Bank governing council, which will grow to 25 members.Lithuania will also join the Eurogroup, the gathering of eurozone political leaders. The Lithuanians \u201cwant to be ideal European citizens,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a former Swedish diplomat who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington. \u201cIf you\u2019re an ideal European citizen, you want to be at every table, not only the E.U. and NATO, but also the Eurogroup and E.C.B.\u201dFor Lithuanian business, adopting the euro removes the administrative burden and cost of money changing, estimated at \u20ac40 million a year, and eliminates any residual risk of a currency crisis. The country can use the boost.Growth is expected to be 2.9 percent for 2014, while the rest of the eurozone is practically stagnant. Still, Lithuania has arguably been hit harder than any other country by the plunge of the Russian ruble and economic sanctions, which have closed off Russia to Lithuanian food products, an important part of the economy. The euro should make it easier for Lithuania to develop substitute markets in countries like Germany.Lithuanians are already benefiting from low interest rates, another byproduct of euro membership. Virginijus Sinkevicius, a 26-year-old project manager for the government who has been looking for an apartment to buy, said that banks had told him he would qualify for loans with a variable rate of less than 2 percent.Many Lithuanians have yet to be convinced of the benefits and worry about higher prices. They equate the litas with stability after a series of economic crises and currency overhauls since the country declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. \u201cA country without a currency is nothing,\u201d said Miroslawa Korwel, who was selling inexpensive perfumes at an outdoor market in Vilnius on Monday, when the temperature was far below freezing.For many ordinary Lithuanians, the euro represents an unsettling change in a country that has had more than its share of upheaval in the last century. Juozas Ruzgys, a 36-year-old Vilnius resident who works in public relations, said he was in favor of the euro, but that his wife\u2019s parents \u2014 farmers near the border with Latvia \u2014 were nervous about giving up a currency they trust. \u201cFor them it\u2019s important that the value doesn\u2019t change,\u201d Mr. Ruzgys said, speaking at a local pub.In Vilnius, covered with a frosting of snow this week, there was little sense that a momentous change was about to take place. Stores displayed signs in the old and new currencies. At the National Museum Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, Tadas Balza was one of three guides on staff at an exhibition on the new currency. He said that Lithuanian visitors were often reassured to learn that there will be euro coins imprinted with the Lithuanian national symbol, a knight on a horse.The changeover to euro bills and coins will be a subdued affair. On Thursday, just after midnight, Mr. Vasiliauskas and other top officials will withdraw the first euro bills from an A.T.M. on Vilnius\u2019s main thoroughfare.In the Seimas, the Lithuanian parliament, a large majority supported membership in the eurozone. A right-wing party, Order and Justice, has tried to exploit anti-euro sentiment, but has attracted limited support.Lithuanians who are in favor of the euro equate it with easier travel and commerce, the surveys show. They do not equate it with national security. But Marius Laurinavicius, a senior analyst at the Eastern Europe Studies Center in Vilnius, said he thought that Lithuanians underestimate how much joining the euro will protect them from aggressive moves by Russia, which has recently staged military drills over the border that Lithuania shares with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.\u201cJoining the core of the European Union would make Lithuania much safer from Russian influence and even Russian aggression,\u201d Mr. Laurinavicius said. He added, \u201cWe have no other choice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Imitation of Marriage", "Date": "2014-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIN the last two weeks, my colleagues at The Times\u2019s data-driven project, The Upshot, have offered two ways of looking at the most important cleavage in America \u2014 the divide, cultural and economic, between the college educated and the struggling working class.The core idea here is that working-class men, in particular, need to let go of a particular image of masculinity \u2014 the silent, disciplined provider, the churchgoing paterfamilias \u2014 that no longer suits the times. Instead, they need to become more comfortable as part-time homemakers, as emotionally available soul mates, and they need to raise their children to be more adaptive and expressive, to prepare them for a knowledge-based, constantly-in-flux economy. Like most powerful ideas, this argument is founded on real truths. For Americans of every social class, the future of marriage will be more egalitarian, with more shared burdens and blurrier divisions of labor, or it will not be at all. And the broad patterns of upper-class family life do prepare children for knowledge-based work in ways that working-class family life does not.But the idea that progressive attitudes can save working-class marriages also has some real problems. First, it underestimates the effective social conservatism of the upper-class model of family life \u2014 the resilience of traditional gender roles in work and child rearing, the continued role of religion in stabilizing well-educated family life, and the conservative messages encoded even in the most progressive education. Meanwhile, as cohabitation and churchgoing trends suggest, many working-class Americans \u2014 men very much included \u2014 have gone further in embracing progressive models of identity and behavior than many realize, and reaped relatively little reward for that embrace. Cherlin, working from progressive premises, sees this as potentially good news: a sign that these men are getting over Gary Cooper and preparing to embrace the more egalitarian and emotionally open patterns of the upper class. But given that this shift has coincided with lost ground for blue-collar men, another interpretation seems possible. We may have a culture in which the working class is encouraged to imitate what are sold as key upper-class values \u2014 sexual permissiveness and self-fashioning, spirituality and emotivism \u2014 when really the upper class is also held together by a kind of secret traditionalism, without whose binding power family life ends up coming apart even faster.If so, it needs to be more widely acknowledged, and even preached, that what\u2019s worth imitating in upper-class family life isn\u2019t purely modern or progressive, but a complex synthesis of new and old.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protecting a Home Where the Puffer Fish Roam in Biscayne National Park", "Date": "2014-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBISCAYNE NATIONAL PARK, Fla. \u2014 For 15 years, officials, environmentalists, fishermen and boaters have struggled to put together a plan to protect one of South Florida\u2019s jewels \u2014 a national park, almost entirely underwater, where a part of the largest reef tract in the United States lures throngs of divers and anglers who fish its once-abundant grouper and snapper.Now, with a plan almost in place to tackle decades of deterioration that has left coral sick and fragile, sea grass stripped clean in places by boats, and the fish population dangerously depleted, one bitter issue remains vexing.Bubbling over the disagreement, however, is a larger question of fairness and consistency in park policies, federal park officials said. Strict rules designed to protect resources and ecosystems in the most cherished national parks \u2014 no hunting in Yosemite, for example \u2014 seem to get short shrift when applied to the fish and coral reefs here in the country\u2019s largest marine park, they said.\u201cBiscayne is a national park,\u201d said Brian Carlstrom, the park\u2019s new superintendent. \u201cIf this were national park land\u201d \u2014 as opposed to national park water \u2014 \u201cthere would be no question of what resources can be extracted from here.\u201dMr. Carlstrom said the habitat across the 173,000 acres of the park, just off the shore of metropolitan Miami, had visibly deteriorated in the past 15 years, which is why officials have been developing a new general management plan. \u201cIf you go out there right now, you won\u2019t see the large predatory fish, because they are not out there,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce they reach the legal size limit, they get caught and harvested at that point in time.\u201dThe fish have come under pressure not only from South Florida\u2019s booming population but also because fast boats, GPS devices and other high-powered gear make finding and catching fish much easier than it was a couple of decades back. Increasingly, though, anglers return with nothing but grunts, which were once considered to be \u201creject\u201d fish, park officials said.Closing the 10,522 acres to fishing \u2014 a section of the park that the federal government controls alone \u2014 is one of several options on the table, Mr. Carlstrom said. It has been shown, in some cases, to be an effective and quick way to replenish fish stocks, scientists said. The larger that a fish is allowed to grow, the more eggs that are released. In Dry Tortugas National Park, off Key West, this approach has helped fish rebound not just in the reserve but also beyond it, the scientists added.A \u201cno-take\u201d zone, Mr. Carlstrom said, would also simplify layers of complex fishing rules for overtaxed marine patrols and anglers who have trouble keeping track of ever-changing regulations. No fishing, he said, simply means no fishing.Other options under consideration by federal park officials include strengthening restrictions on the size and number of fish that can be taken and tightening controls on which times of the year people can fish, all approaches the state prefers. Numerous public meetings on the plan have been held over the years.State officials bristle at the idea of a no-take reserve. They said the proposed section is one of the park\u2019s most popular areas and covers about 30 percent of the reef tract. In their view, shutting down fishing should always be a last resort, and in this case it is not, they argued.\u201cThere are lots of other fishery management tools out there that need to be tried first,\u201d said Jessica McCawley, the director of the marine fisheries management division for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \u201cOnce you have to close down an area, it\u2019s almost like fisheries management has failed.\u201dAgency officials added that they wanted firmer science behind the no-take alternative and better estimates of the fish population in the 10,522 acres.\u201cSome of the data we don\u2019t necessarily agree with,\u201d Ms. McCawley said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that overall fishery resources are in as good a shape as they were 20 years ago,\u201d but the state commission and the National Park Service disagree on the extent of the decline, she added.Many recreational anglers and the industries that support them agree with the agency\u2019s position. Nobody wants to see the fish vanish altogether, but reaching for the most extreme solution does not make sense, they said.\u201cThis would take 30 percent of the best reef fishing away from the fisherman,\u201d said Carl Liederman, the president of Captain Harry\u2019s Fishing Supply in Miami and a member of several fishermen\u2019s and conservation groups. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can fix it before we close 10,000 acres in one of the largest boating areas in the country.\u201d He added that he always finds grouper in the park to catch.The state and federal governments are not completely at odds; each understands that fish do not recognize artificial boundaries. In July, the two agencies completed a separate fishery management plan that set goals for the entire park. (The federal government solely controls only two-thirds of the park.) They agreed to increase the fish population by 20 percent, create tougher restrictions on spearfishing gear, phase out commercial fishing and end a two-day lobster season for recreational users. Now state regulators must figure out how to put the goals into effect.The larger question of the no-take reserve, though, still poses a hurdle for overall management. Gil Muratori, who is part of a coalition of recreational fishermen pushing to ban fishing, said anglers, including himself, are to blame for the situation. For decades, Mr. Muratori said, they have needlessly packed coolers with too many fish.The park should be treated with the respect it deserves, he said.\u201cEveryone feels that, as an American citizen, they can fish wherever they want, but people accept that you can\u2019t shoot buffalo or deer at Yellowstone and Yosemite,\u201d Mr. Muratori said. \u201cThere is a lack of understanding, in my opinion. What people accept on land they have a problem accepting on water.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growth vs. What Really Makes Life Good", "Date": "2014-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyCan people have a good life without economic growth?Merely raising the question challenges the conventional wisdom that a society\u2019s prime goal should be to increase its income. But it is one that the West, especially Western Europe, may have to confront. Europe is not just suffering the aftereffects of a nasty cyclical downturn. It has probably entered an era of low growth.Trend growth \u2014 the long-term rate of economic expansion \u2014 is likely to be lower than it was in the past. Part of this is because the European population is aging rapidly. Part may be because of increasing competition from developing countries, whose growing prowess puts many Western businesses and workers under pressure. Part may also be because of environmental constraints: measures to slow down global warming, for example, are pushing up energy prices.In countries where populations are aging especially rapidly and entrepreneurialism is subdued, like Italy, trend growth may now be practically zero. Even Britain, which is aging less rapidly and enjoys a vibrant entrepreneurial culture, is probably looking at trend growth of below 2 percent a year.It is easy to see how a low-growth economy could become a dystopia: high youth unemployment could lead to a wasted generation; government debt burdens could prove unsustainable, forcing further cuts in public services; sections of society could be trapped in poverty; politics could become increasingly embittered.Is there an alternative way of living with low growth? The beginning of an answer is to recognize that the economy should serve society, rather than vice versa. What this means is providing the conditions in which people can lead good lives.The question then becomes: What is a good life? Here, it may be useful to go back to Aristotle, who thought a good life involved acting well in accordance with our nature. The Greek philosopher also thought that we have two natures, animal and human. One way of rephrasing Aristotle\u2019s doctrine is to think of the good life as having two components: the life of the body (which we share with animals), and the life of the mind (which is distinctly human).So a good life certainly requires a certain amount of basic stuff: most obviously food, shelter and clothing, but many other things, too, in particular health. Modern societies are paying increasing attention to doctors and fitness regimes. But we only have to look around and witness phenomena like the obesity epidemic to realize that all is not well as far as the life of the body is concerned.Meanwhile, the life of the mind can be viewed as encompassing a broad array of human preoccupations: values, creativity, appreciation of beauty, intellectual curiosity and struggling to make sense of our lives. Consuming more stuff doesn\u2019t necessarily help us do any of this. Indeed, studies by economists like Richard Layard show that beyond a certain point, more income does nothing to promote happiness.Economic growth in the West has been accompanied by growing loneliness and depression. This suggests that a materialistic-only philosophy is not in accord with deeper human nature. In pursuing growth, other precious things can get damaged. This includes our social environment \u2014 our communities and networks of friendship and family \u2014 as well as our physical environment.One could imagine that the West\u2019s rich societies ought to be able to create the conditions for a good life without much more growth. They would focus more on quality than quantity. They would value dynamism but not view success primarily through the lens of making money. And they would take care of the social fabric.But there are still vexed questions, like how to deal with unemployment and public debt without growth. One place to look for answers might be the Green movement, which has been advocating zero or negative growth for decades. But a recent volume of essays by Green House, a British research group, suggests that it has yet to come up with compelling solutions.For example, Green House advocates \u201csharing\u201d work as a way of solving unemployment. The idea is that people who are overworked should cut their hours, making room for the unemployed to get jobs.If only it were that simple. For a start, people working long hours may not want to work less. Even if they were forced to (and such compulsion would prima facie be contrary to the good life), that might not lead to more jobs for unemployed workers, many of whom would lack the necessary skills. Rather than sharing work, the emphasis ought to be on training and education.Even if the Green movement does not have the answers, one thing is clear: it won\u2019t be possible to find them without a change of mind-set that values the good life over economic growth for the sake of itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin, Amid Stark Challenges, Says Russia\u2019s Destiny Is in Hand", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The defining event of Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s initial rise to power was the crushing of an Islamist insurgency in Chechnya, at the cost of human rights abuses and years of dictatorial rule there.On Thursday, Mr. Putin was forced to contend with trouble on both fronts, as insurgents mounted a deadly attack in the Chechen capital of Grozny, and he was compelled in his yearly address to reassure Russians that his assertive foreign policy would not bring economic ruin.Mr. Putin sought to portray himself as a leader with Russia\u2019s glorious destiny firmly in hand, a viewpoint echoed by his supporters. His critics, however, called the speech way off the mark, if not delusional, with Mr. Putin acknowledging neither the scope of the problems nor his role in creating them. \u201cHe thinks that overall the situation is under control \u2014 the problems with the foreign currency reserves, oil, the budget, the ruble, the economy, inflation and so on \u2014 but the situation is not under control,\u201d said Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, an opposition politician. \u201cThe country needs surgery, and he proposed therapy.\u201dStanding in the Kremlin\u2019s glittering white marble St. George Hall before more than 1,000 members of the country\u2019s political elite, Mr. Putin acknowledged that Russia was facing hard times, but reaffirmed the combative foreign policy course he set earlier this year.In the first part of the 70-minute speech, Mr. Putin adopted the angry, aggrieved tone toward the West that he has used since Russia annexed Crimea in March, blaming the United States for starting the trouble by fomenting a coup in Ukraine. He used a more professorial tone in the second, economic part of the speech, but it proved to be a laundry list of small adjustments, many of them recycled.In one striking passage, Mr. Putin compared Crimea to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, saying the peninsula held sacred importance for Russians because the Russian Orthodox Church was born there. Grand Prince Vladimir, considered the ruler who converted the tribes to Christianity, was said to have been baptized near today\u2019s modern city of Sevastopol. Mr. Putin said the West used the annexation as a pretext to continue its historical attempts to restrain Russia.\u201cThe policy of containment was not invented yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been carried out against our country for many years, always, for decades, if not centuries. In short, whenever someone thinks that Russia has become too strong or independent, these tools are quickly put into use.\u201dEvoking World War II history, a favorite device, Mr. Putin suggested attempts to dismember Russia through sanctions and other means would fail just as Adolf Hitler had failed to conquer Russia.Mr. Putin also stressed that Russia did not want to restore the Iron Curtain, that the country was open to the world and that it would never \u201cpursue paranoia, suspicion and looking for enemies.\u201dBefore moving on to economic policy, Mr. Putin made a passing reference to the attack in Chechnya, but contended that local law enforcement officers could handle it. Still, even as he tried to brush off the most brazen attack there in many years, it was clear Mr. Putin\u2019s determination to restore stability was being challenged on yet another front. With his budget already strained, Mr. Putin was again confronted with dedicating resources to Grozny even as he is committed to supplying a not-so-stealth campaign in eastern Ukraine.While Mr. Putin\u2019s resolve appeared strong, his treasury\u2019s health was not.The problems have set off an extended fight in the Kremlin, which was already divided over Ukraine. \u201cOne school says that Putin will keep the mobilization among the people, the society and the elite despite the economic crisis,\u201d Mr. Ryzhkov said. \u201cIf he prolongs the policy of greatness, of expansion, of confrontation with the West, he will be popular and supported by the people despite any economic crisis.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t believe the Russian people\u00a0will support him if they lose their medicine, their health benefits, their education and their good standard of living,\u201d Mr. Ryzhkov said.Economists describe the enormous Russian corporate debt, with about $650 billion owed to Western banks, as the worst problem. The sanctions block access to any new Western capital, and it is not clear how the debts can be repaid.Mr. Putin said Thursday that billions of dollars salted away in one of the government\u2019s sovereign wealth funds should be used to prop up domestic banks. Some of Russia\u2019s largest banks, including VTB and Gazprombank, have already asked for handouts from the roughly $81 billion sitting in the National Wealth Fund, out of total foreign currency reserves of $420 billion.Mr. Putin did not say how Russia would close the huge gap between the corporate debts and the reserves. Analysts suggest that the government thinks the sanctions will be lifted in a year so they will not have to find a solution.Mr. Putin said his country should use the confrontation with the West to try to overhaul its economy, and to depend more on itself for food, medicine and technology. He said there should be a four-year freeze in the business tax rate and proposed that honest small and medium businesses get a reprieve from constant government inspections, a font of corruption.Over all, analysts said the speech would probably not achieve its main purpose: That is to assure the\u00a0so-called budgetniki \u2014 people like teachers, doctors and government workers who depend on the federal budget for their salaries \u2014 that growing inflation and the dropping ruble would not undermine their standard of living.\u201cThere are people totally oriented toward the government \u2014 I think that he calmed them down, but they were already calm,\u201d said\u00a0Aleksei V.\u00a0Makarkin, an analyst at Moscow\u2019s Center for Political Technologies.Everyone else will face a different reality, he said, \u201cFrom the businessman thinking about how he can continue working under the new conditions to the simple man who goes to the store and sees that prices have risen \u2014 I think that this speech could not have answered all these questions.\u201dAndrew Roth contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

The Palestinian cause is the key issue to be settled.\u201dAn American State Department spokesman called the action \u201ccounterproductive,\u201d arguing that it would only push the two sides further apart.\u201cIt is an escalatory step that will not achieve any of the outcomes most Palestinians have long hoped to see for their people,\u201d Jeff Rathke, the spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cActions like this are not the answer. Hard as it is, all sides need to find a way to work constructively and cooperatively together to lower tensions, reject violence and find a path forward.\u201dMr. Abbas, whose popularity plummeted after the battle between Israel and Hamas over the summer, has been pressed by other Palestinian leaders and the public to sign the statute and then use the court to pursue cases against Israel\u2019s settlement policy and its military operations. But the step could have major repercussions, not least because Palestinian officials could also be charged by the court. Israel and the United States have promised to respond harshly to the move.\u201cThey have to take some meaningful steps to recover anything of their really shredded credibility,\u201d Nadia Hijab, executive director of Al-Shabaka: The Palestinian Policy Network, said of Mr. Abbas\u2019s team. \u201cThat fig leaf of action is growing steadily more tattered. They keep saying it\u2019s a new paradigm and they want to use international tools, but now they have actually been put on the spot.\u201dMeeting after a ceremony marking Fatah\u2019s 50th anniversary, the Palestinian leadership decided to return to the Security Council in the new year, when changes in its membership make passage of the resolution more likely. That could force an American veto that the Obama administration has tried to avoid. Afterward, Mr. Abbas made a show of signing the papers to accede to the international conventions, though the Palestinians cannot take action under the agreements for up to 90 days, a window of time that some in Washington are counting on to calm the situation.Aaron David Miller, a regional expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, said that \u201cin a single move, Palestinians have managed to buck up the Israeli right,\u201d give Mr. Netanyahu \u201ca great campaign issue,\u201d undermine his opponents, \u201cand alienate the Americans in the process.\u201dBut the most significant is the one with the International Criminal Court, created in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It currently has 122 members, including most of Western Europe but not Israel or the United States.The Palestinians asked the court in 2009 to investigate Israeli actions during Operation Cast Lead, a three-week military offensive in Gaza, but their request was rejected because they lacked the required United Nations status. A 2012 vote in the General Assembly upgraded Palestine to a nonmember observer state, and some Palestinians had been urging Mr. Abbas to sign the Rome Statute ever since. But questions remain about Palestine\u2019s qualifications, and in any event it is up to the court to decide which cases to pursue.Shurat HaDin, an Israeli legal group, has already filed war-crimes complaints at The Hague against Hamas. Mr. Abbas said Wednesday night that the Palestinian move meant that other Palestinian officials \u201cwill be able to be sued as well.\u201dNaftali Bennett, Israel\u2019s economy minister, said that Mr. Abbas, too, could find himself charged. He warned in a statement, \u201cSomeone who has terrorism smeared all over his head should not stand in the sun.\u201dEarlier Wednesday, several thousand Palestinians, including hundreds of rifle-toting security troops with faces hidden by masks or black paint, marched in a sea of yellow Fatah flags from Manara Square in Ramallah to Mr. Abbas\u2019s headquarters, called the Muqata, for the anniversary ceremony. In Gaza City, at least 1,000 people met in the Unknown Soldier park for a parallel event that had not been publicized.\u201cI\u2019m here today to express my love for Palestine,\u201d said one of the Gaza participants, Fouad al-Kharobi, who kept his daughters from the event for fear that Hamas would quash it. \u201cI want to see Gaza in a new year that has some kind of stability and peace.\u201dIn Manara Square, several onlookers seemed despondent. \u201cThe peaceful solution doesn\u2019t bring any result,\u201d said Jalal Mahmoud, 23. \u201cI don\u2019t want to participate in the march. It is useless.\u201dJamal Hashem, who runs a dry-cleaning shop near the Muqata, said he opposed a third intifada, or uprising, against the occupation.\u201cThe Israelis will kill us and the business; I will be dead,\u201d said Mr. Hashem, 44. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what we should do.\u201dMahdi Abdul-Hadi, director of the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs, said criticism of the Palestinian Authority from the public and from intellectuals had mounted in recent weeks.\u201cThe performance in New York was zero, very weak, very disappointing,\u201d he said of the Palestinians\u2019 efforts at the United Nations. \u201cThis is the call of the streets. Everybody is calling just to challenge the de facto apartheid regime, just to challenge Israel.\u201dBut Ms. Hijab of the Washington-based Al-Shabaka group said that Wednesday\u2019s move may have been unnecessary. She argued that the Palestinians \u201cneed to use the tools they already have to better effect.\u201d\u201cThey could be demanding that the Europeans cut completely any import of settlement products, that they stop settlers from traveling to Europe, and I think they would find ready ears here,\u201d she said from her home in France. \u201cWhat worries me is that all this joining stuff smacks of buying time, so as not to take action. Doing something meaningful with what you\u2019ve joined is what\u2019s really needed.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of international treaties and conventions President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority signed on Wednesday. It was 16, according to the United Nations, not 22, as the Palestinians said at the signing. (The Palestinians now say Mr. Abbas signed 18, including two that did not need United Nations ratification.)

{"Headline": "Good News Inside the Health Spending Numbers", "Date": "2014-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthInside the continuing slowdown in the growth in health spending is evidence that the American health care system may be changing in ways that could make it more affordable in the years to come.Some things bucked the downward trend, of course: The federal-state Medicaid program grew faster in 2013 than it did the year before, driven mostly by an increase in enrollment. And spending on prescription drugs, which has been low for years, started to turn up again.Optimists about the spending slowdown argue that the recent low growth is a sign that health care is becoming more efficient and safe. The new report shows some trends that are consistent with that thesis. The reduction in hospital spending suggests that more people may be getting care in the doctor\u2019s office or at home before they get sick enough to need hospitalization. The actuaries also noted a reduction in a particular kind of hospitalization known as a readmission; that\u2019s when a patient leaves the hospital only to return within a month.This week, federal officials reported that the number of serious medical errors in the country had declined by 17 percent between 2010 and 2013, representing a savings of about $12 billion in health spending. That, alone, is not enough to explain much of the slowdown, but it\u2019s the kind of good sign that suggests the presence of changes in how doctors and hospitals are delivering care to make it both of higher quality and less expensive.There\u2019s another possible explanation for the low growth, however, and it\u2019s one that the federal officials stressed: It could be merely the result of a weak economy after a recession.\u201cThe pattern observed in recent years is not unique and is consistent with historical patterns,\u201d said Anne Martin, an economist at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the government agency that made the calculations.If you look back further than the 1990s, however, that pattern hasn\u2019t always held. For much of the last 54 years, health spending has simply grown faster than the economy, regardless of the business cycle. There\u2019s really only one period in the past when health spending growth stayed as slow as what we\u2019re seeing now for several years. That was in the late 1990s, when the health care system was changing in significant ways through the shift to managed care for Americans with workplace insurance and big cuts to Medicare spending imposed by Congress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Diplomatic Triumph in Cuba Comes With a Challenge in North Korea ", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 For more than five decades, the United States has found itself in periodic confrontation with two Communist nations that have survived on a diet of anti-Americanism, and defied the overwhelming odds that they would have collapsed years ago. Now, in the same week, Cuba and North Korea have veered in entirely different directions, posing opposite challenges for the Obama administration. Cuba is now the newest experiment in integration, and North Korea a case study in how to contain an old adversary brandishing an entirely new weapon.The Cuba question boils down to this: Now that President Obama has abandoned a policy of isolation that has failed for 53 years, what are the prospects of changing the nation the way the United States has tried to change China and Vietnam \u2014 the two former adversaries the president cited Wednesday as examples of successful engagement? In both cases, the idea is to lure such adversaries into adhering to Western-designed rules for dealing with the world, in return for the economic benefits of economic integration. In each case, it is still a work in progress.North Korea, in contrast, has escalated its confrontation with the United States, but in a far more innovative way than building nuclear weapons or firing off missiles. Instead, it has turned to a new tool \u2014 easily deniable cyberattacks \u2014 and so provoked the White House that a spokesman said on Thursday that the United States was looking for a \u201cproportional response.\u201d But deterring cyberattacks from an isolated nation like North Korea is notoriously difficult \u2014 and in that battle, Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s leader, not only won the first round, but still holds a few cards. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here is that Cuba has made a strategic decision that it can normalize relations and engage in integration without threatening their regime survival,\u201d said Robert S. Litwak, a scholar at the Wilson Center for International Scholars and author of \u201cOutlier States: American Strategies to Change, Contain or Engage Regimes.\u201d \u201cNorth Korea has made the other calculus, that it can\u2019t survive integration,\u201d he said, \u201cand its new survival strategy is to attack the hyperconnected world of which it is not a part.\u201d So far the president is batting 2 for 6: Myanmar came around four years ago, and Cuba this week. Libya and Syria descended into civil war. And no country is watching the outcome of the Cuba-North Korea-United States triangle more than the Iranians, who are engaged in the same internal debate over the merits of integrating with the West versus defying it.The differences between Cuba and North Korea are vast. While they both emerged as proxy states in the Cold War, Cuba\u2019s nuclear ambitions ended with the missile crisis in 1962. While it remains a subject of heated political debate in the United States about its human rights record, it has not posed a credible threat to America in decades. Its rhetoric about American imperialism had lost its fire, fading like an aging poster of Fidel Castro, nursing a cigar in the bloom of revolutionary youth.\u201cThis is a regime that has been molting,\u201d said Julia E. Sweig, the director of Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. More than a year ago Raul Castro\u2019s government allowed Cubans to travel freely, a factor that administration officials say influenced Mr. Obama\u2019s decision. \u201cThey have made a calculation that rather than try to control the movements of their own people, that Cubans can be part of the global economy and come back and have homes and businesses inside and outside of Cuba,\u201d Ms. Sweig said. That is one reason that the technological elements of Mr. Obama\u2019s initiative on Wednesday are so important: They are designed to wire the island, making a country that has long viewed itself as a Western society an integral part of it.This is not a risk-free strategy for either Mr. Obama or the Cuban government. If Cuba\u2019s human rights performance follows China\u2019s path, Mr. Obama will be charged with failed engagement \u2014 though there is no evidence that isolation worked at influencing the Cuban government\u2019s behavior. On the other hand, if the opening of full relations results in something more akin to Libya-like chaos \u2014 an extremely unlikely possibility \u2014 Raul Castro will have destroyed the family enterprise. North Korea is at the other end of the spectrum. Its people cannot travel. There is no international Internet access, save for the elite. And the government is paranoid about plots to unseat it, a neuralgia that \u201cThe Interview,\u201d Sony\u2019s crude comedy about an assassination of Mr. Kim, set off.If Cuba had its nuclear moment decades ago, North Korea is in the midst of its own. It has the fuel to make six to 12 weapons. But they are useless as a tool to jab at the West. That is where cyberweapons come in \u2014 their use is deniable, and the severity of the attacks can be adjusted up and down. Until now, no cyberattack on the United States has provoked a national response. When banks or retailers have been hit by denial-of-service attacks \u2014 which overwhelm a computer system but do not permanently disable it \u2014 companies have been left to fend for themselves. But Sony was different.A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, explained the reasons this attack was briefed to the president on almost a daily basis over the past week. \u201cThe first is that it\u2019s actual, destructive malware, being used against the U. S. subsidiary of a Japanese company \u2014 that is, a company on American soil,\u201d the official said. \u201cAnd the second is the manner in which the stolen data is being used \u2014 to influence the actions of that company and prevent a movie from being shown.\u201dBut it is unclear what pain Mr. Obama can inflict in return to create some semblance of deterrence. North Korea is under so many sanctions already that adding more seems futile. Return cyberattacks are possible, but, since the North is such an unwired society, the targets are few \u2014 and the opportunities for retaliation against the United States are vast.And so Mr. Obama finds himself facing the same problem that every president since Harry S. Truman has faced in North Korea: A recalcitrant leader who has concluded that engagement with richer nations amounts to a suicide pact for the Kim family dynasty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anxiety Over European Banks Amid Ruble Crisis", "Date": "2014-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 On paper, the vulnerability of European banks to the sinking Russian ruble is manageable, less than their exposure to Greece during the height of the eurozone debt crisis.Try telling that to the traders this week. The ongoing rout of the ruble prompted a broader decline in emerging market currencies like the Turkish lira, which hit an all-time low on Monday before recovering slightly on Tuesday. The turmoil also clobbered shares of banks and other companies perceived as being vulnerable to Russia or the ruble. \u201cThe direct effects are likely to be small,\u201d Ben May, a senior eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London, said of the ruble\u2019s decline. \u201cIt\u2019s more the uncertainty it creates.\u201dThe ruble meltdown served to reawaken a host of other latent fears about the state of the eurozone economy, slower growth in emerging markets, and continuing violence in Ukraine.\u201cThere is country-specific risk for Russia,\u201d said Phyllis Papadavid, a foreign exchange strategist at BNP Paribas in London. \u201cBut there\u2019s a larger story. There\u2019s a weakness in global sentiment.\u201d She pointed to a report on Tuesday suggesting that China\u2019s manufacturing sector was losing steam. The fear was amplified by the Russian central bank\u2019s announcement in the dead of night that it would raise one of its main interest rates to 17 percent from 10.5 percent. The move, intended to make it more attractive to hold deposits in rubles, smacked of desperation and did not inspire confidence in Russian policy-making.In afternoon trading, the Russian currency resumed its fall to record lows, with the dollar rising above 79 rubles in spite of the bank\u2019s policy shift. On Monday, it had collapsed to 64 rubles to the dollar by the end of the day, its worst one-day sell-off since Russia defaulted on its debts in 1998.Adding to the nervousness on Tuesday was the lack of precise, up-to-date information about which European banks might have large holdings of, say, Russian government debt. When the European Central Bank began its examination of the resilience of eurozone lenders at the beginning of the year, a ruble decline seemed like a remote possibility. Hardly anyone anticipated the steep fall in energy prices that would undercut the Russian economy.As a result, the European Central Bank did not include a ruble crisis among the hypothetical scenarios it used to test banks\u2019 ability to withstand stress. Data released by the central bank in October following the bank review provide detailed information on individual banks\u2019 exposure to the government debt of countries like Malta or Slovenia, but not Russia.The European Central Bank declined to comment on Tuesday, but a person with knowledge of its bank supervisory arm said that officials were closely monitoring banks that are exposed to the Russian economy or Russian debt.In the vacuum of public data, investors ganged up on banks and other companies known to have large Russian holdings. The targets included Raiffeisen Bank International in Vienna and the Danish brewer Carlsberg.Shares of Carlsberg, whose Baltika brand is the biggest selling beer in Russia, fell 7.5 percent. A Carlsberg spokesman declined to comment, except to refer to an earnings report published last month that described the Russian market as \u201cdifficult.\u201d Shares of Raiffeisen Bank, which earned more than 70 percent of its pretax profit from its Russian subsidiary in the first nine months of this year, fell more than 8 percent on Tuesday. \u201cAll financials with exposure to Russia are currently suffering,\u201d Ingrid Krenn-Ditz, a Raiffeisen spokeswoman, said in an email. \u201cIn Russia we continue to pursue a policy of selective underwriting\u201d with a focus on customers, she added.Largely because of Raiffeisen and Bank Austria, a unit of the Italian bank UniCredit, Austria is the eurozone country most exposed to tumult in Russia. The maximum potential loss is about 4 percent of Austrian gross domestic product, according to Oxford Economics.French bank exposure to Russia is about 2 percent of G.D.P., according to figures from 2013, while for Italy the figure is about 1 percent. For Germany, Spain and most other eurozone countries, the exposure is well below 1 percent of G.D.P.In a report in October, the Bank of France estimated that the country\u2019s largest banks had loans and other investments in Russia of 47.3 billion euros, or $59.2 billion, at the end of 2013, a substantial sum but far less than their exposure to Western European countries like Switzerland or Belgium.\u201cIf you compare those exposures to exposures to Greece at the worst of the crisis, banks are much less exposed to Russia,\u201d Mr. May of Oxford Economics said. He noted, however, that there was no comprehensive recent data.Investors were clearly worried about some individual institutions. Shares of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in France suffered the biggest losses in the Euro Stoxx 50 index on Tuesday, falling 4.7 percent. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale owns Rosbank, a major lender based in Moscow, as well as two smaller Russian financial institutions, DeltaCredit and Rusfinance Bank. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale declined to comment Tuesday.Deutsche Bank shares fell 2.6 percent. That bank, based in Frankfurt, has loans outstanding to Russian customers of \u20ac5.2 billion euros, nearly 1 percent of its total credit exposure. Ronald Weichert, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, said the bank was confident it could manage the impact of a ruble crisis.Emerging market currencies also suffered as the turmoil in Russia called attention to their economic and political weaknesses.The Turkish lira fell to an all-time low of about $0.42 on Monday, though it rose slightly on Tuesday. Investors were unnerved not only by Turkey\u2019s proximity to Russia but also by the threat of political instability after a new wave of repression against opponents of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\u201cThere is just no way that an intertwined European economy can believe it is isolated from all this negative spillover,\u201d currency market analysts at Commerzbank in Frankfurt said in a note to clients on Tuesday, \u201cespecially at a time when the eurozone has its own issues to deal with.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Winter of Mr. Putin\u2019s Discontent ", "Date": "2014-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt is hard to imagine that this was a state of the nation address President Vladimir Putin relished making. Far from giving any hint of a readiness to scale back the tensions over Ukraine, Mr. Putin actually equated Crimea\u2019s importance for Russia to the Temple Mount\u2019s importance for Jews.Fulminating at the West and blaming it for all of Russia\u2019s woes has kept Mr. Putin\u2019s ratings high through the Ukraine crisis and has deflected any of the immediate blame for Russia\u2019s growing problems onto \u201cenemies,\u201d so it was not surprising that Mr. Putin would stay with it.But he could not escape the growing concern among many Russians about where their economy is headed. The ruble has plummeted; oil is trading far below the levels on which Russia\u2019s budget was drawn up; and the government has acknowledged that the country is headed for a recession. The anxiety is palpable in Russian streets.Mr. Putin\u2019s response was a combination of bravado and carrots. The current tensions, he said, should help Russia overhaul its economy to become more self-sufficient. He promised to make doing business easier for small and middle-sized companies, and announced a four-year freeze on the tax rate. And he vowed not to ask questions of oligarchs who bring back any of the billions that have been fleeing abroad.Some of these measures are reasonable and could be helpful, but the question is whether they will be enough for Mr. Putin to ride out the storm. A majority of Russians were willing to surrender some freedom as long as they enjoyed prosperity, and to cheer Mr. Putin on as long as he seemed to be restoring Russian self-respect and power. But as prices increase and recession sets in, the bluster will become increasingly hollow. Mr. Putin\u2019s choice then will be to become even more belligerent and ruthless, at home and abroad \u2014 or to recognize that the solution is to stop lying about the West, and to start trying to resolve the Ukraine crisis and fix the real problems of Russia\u2019s economy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "France Is Forced to Face Political Facts in Effort to Stoke Economy", "Date": "2014-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Moving to battle high unemployment and a stagnant economy, the Socialist government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on Wednesday announced a long-promised program meant to stoke growth and create jobs.The measures, including allowing more retail stores to open on Sundays, fall far short of what some experts say is needed to revive the stagnant French economy. Nonetheless, important members of Mr. Hollande\u2019s own Socialist Party denounced the proposals as too threatening to the French way of life \u2014 in perhaps the clearest signal of why economic change is so hard to achieve in contemporary France.Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the head of the leftist Front de Gauche, called on the French to march in the streets in protest.The so-called Macron law would open traditionally closed professions like those of notaries and auctioneers to more competition. It would let long-haul bus lines run frequently to compete more directly with the French national railway service. France would also sell 5 billion to 10 billion euros, or $6.2 billion to $12.4 billion, of state assets to reduce the French debt and invest in the economy.As for Sundays, when many supermarkets must now close by 1 p.m. and most other retail stores do not open at all, the Macron proposals would let shops do business in major tourist areas. Other types of stores in other locations would have the option of being open for as many as 12 Sundays a year.\u201cUnemployment has not stopped rising for six years, and our priority is to fight it and to create jobs,\u201d Prime Minister Manuel Valls said at a briefing on Wednesday at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, where he was flanked by ministers of Mr. Hollande\u2019s cabinet, including Mr. Macron.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in artificial solutions to reduce the numbers,\u201d Mr. Valls said. \u201cThe solution is that we need to enhance our competitiveness.\u201dWith his ratings at the lowest of any French president in modern times, Mr. Hollande was already facing his party\u2019s opposition to the more far-reaching, more centrist economic proposals that he had announced in the last year. A so-called responsibility pact, in which the government granted billions in tax breaks in exchange for a job-creation pledge by businesses, was opposed by unions, which said it gave too many concessions to employers.The plan also opened a rift with France\u2019s biggest employers\u2019 association, Medef, which argued that the government was not doing enough to spur growth.Mr. Macron recently acknowledged that the responsibility pact had thus far been a failure. But with the Hollande government on such a shaky political base, there was little room for the package announced on Wednesday to be more ambitious.Economists say France still needs to make it easier for firms to hire and fire and to encourage investments.\u201cThough elements of his government are openly social-liberal and willing to push certain reforms, the government\u2019s majority in the National Assembly is very fragile and can no longer be taken for granted,\u201d said Famke Krumbm\u00fcller, an analyst based in London at the Eurasia Group. \u201cThis means that even if there is a certain degree of political willingness within the government, the political incapacity of its majority to promulgate these measures will prevail.\u201dThe French Parliament is to start debating the measures next month. But before the ink was dry, Socialist leaders made their opposition clear.\u201cTo believe that employees will go happily to work on Sundays under the pretext that they need jobs or will get premium pay shows a profound ignorance of reality,\u201d Ms. Aubry wrote in Le Monde. \u201cDo we want consumption to be the alpha and the omega of society?\u201dLast year, Mr. Hollande had also moved to loosen restrictive labor practices, making it easier for companies to lay off employees in some cases and to cut workers\u2019 pay and hours when times are hard, in exchange for extending more benefits to workers on short-term contracts. So far, though, only a handful of companies have tapped the measure, the government has said.Mr. Hollande had made it a campaign promise to reduce unemployment and spur job creation in an economy that has barely grown for two years. But joblessness has remained stuck near a high of around 10 percent. He pledged last month that he would not run for office again unless unemployment fell. The government expects the economy to grow only 0.4 percent this year, and 1 percent next year.Aside from addressing a skeptical French public, the measures were also a last-ditch attempt aimed at convincing France\u2019s European partners that it is taking more steps to restructure the economy, after the government told the European Commission that it would not try to rapidly comply with rules requiring debt and deficit reduction at the risk of crimping growth.France has repeatedly missed a requirement that budget deficits not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product, and the government warned recently that it was unlikely to meet the deficit requirement before 2017.The European Commission agreed last month to give France, Italy and Belgium until spring to bring their budgets into line with legal requirements as France and other large countries push back against German-led austerity in Europe.Shortly after, the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, said that overhauls were being done for the French, \u201cnot to please this or that European politician.\u201dOn Wednesday, Mr. Valls said that it was not only up to France to pursue growth. \u201cWe want a policy of European growth, with less rapid deficit reduction so as not to kill growth, and more investment,\u201d he said.\u201cEveryone needs to accept changing what doesn\u2019t work well,\u201d he added, \u201ceven if that might upend long-held attitudes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

High walls separate the slums of Annawadi from the gleaming new hotels circling the airport.She used a gruesome death, and the family brought to trial for causing it, as a focal point for an intimately researched study of the toxins of Indian culture: the endemic corruption that trickles down to the poor from above, even as precious little economic opportunity does; the dire living conditions that make morality a luxury few can afford; and the prejudice against the Muslim minority evinced by Hindus of even the lower classes.Mr. Hare has done a creditable job of capturing Ms. Boo\u2019s panoramic, populous exploration of a culture too few in the West have ever examined in such scrupulous detail. For those who have not read the book, in particular, this trauma-stuffed and well-acted evening may come as a revelation, albeit a dispiriting one, as we watch men, women and children ground down under the pressures of poverty, rigid traditions and that eternal international epidemic, man\u2019s cruelty to man.The primary strand of the story follows the descending fortunes of the Husain family. The elder son, Abdul, played by the excellent Shane Zaza, is the primary breadwinner. He sorts the trash collected by \u201cpickers\u201d like his friend Sunil (the charming Hiran Abeysekera). Picking is less prestigious and profitable than sorting, so the Husain family \u2014 Abdul\u2019s mother, Zehrunisa (Meera Syal), his sister Kehkashan (Anjli Mohindra), father Karam (Vincent Ebrahim) and brother Mirchi (Ronak Patani) \u2014 lives comparatively well.In the opening moments, we watch as Abdul\u2019s hands flicker like a magician\u2019s over a pile of bottles, cans and anything else tossed aside by people moving in and around the airport. Paul Arditti\u2019s sound design and the video by Jack Henry James regularly startle us with the whoosh of a jetliner descending, symbolic of the larger world that the play\u2019s characters know only from the detritus the passengers toss in trash cans. Seen at a distance on Katrina Lindsay\u2019s complex set, screens at the back of the stage advertise the latest lush Bollywood movie or luxury beauty product.The relative prosperity of the Husains indirectly causes the calamity that befalls them. While renovating a wall of their small house \u2014 a mere shanty, but deluxe compared with some \u2014 they squabble with their neighbor, the one-legged Fatima (Thusitha Jayasundera). Hysterical with envy and the shame of her own life \u2014 which she assuages by sleeping around \u2014 Fatima avenges herself upon the Husains by committing a gruesome act of self-destruction. Although there are plenty of witnesses who know that Fatima alone is to blame for her injuries, their jealousy of the Husains and the absurd workings of the Indian justice system conspire to land almost all the members of the family in jail. Their business collapses as bribe after bribe is demanded by everyone involved in the case.Still, inevitably the play takes shortcuts, as when Fatima, being attended by doctors in the hospital, exults, \u201cAt last I count, I count for something.\u201d Lucid though Mr. Hare\u2019s adaptation is, the multiple strands of the plot make it impossible for him to do justice to the complexity of the book\u2019s characters. (Often they step to the front of the stage to explain themselves or their history to us.)Mr. Norris\u2019s visceral direction drives the production forward and mostly clarifies the story lines. Only occasionally does he lapse into heavy symbolism, as when the scales that Abdul uses to weigh his takings, hanging above the stage, are used as a blunt image invoking the rusty wheels of justice.The excellent cast illuminates the pressures \u2014 internal and external \u2014 that drive their characters either upward or downward (mostly the latter). But in the figures of the younger generation like Abdul, Sunil and Manju (Anjana Vasan), the well-schooled daughter of the local \u201cfixer,\u201d \u201cBehind the Beautiful Forevers\u201d suggests that the sweet aroma of hope may be discerned even amid the stench of Annawadi. In time, and with the attention that Ms. Boo\u2019s book and Mr. Hare\u2019s play may help bring to it, the privation so vividly enacted before us may gradually ease, allowing future generations to take a few hesitant steps up India\u2019s perilously steep economic ladder.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Jobs Report, Obama Takes a Little Credit", "Date": "2014-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWashington MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Before introducing his nominee to fill the job of defense secretary, President Obama took a moment on Friday to celebrate the creation of 321,000 additional jobs in November. It was as close to a victory lap on the economy that Mr. Obama has taken.\u201cIt\u2019s worth us every once in a while reflecting on the fact that the American economy is making real progress,\u201d the president said, after ticking off a series of monthly and annual statistics for job growth that the American economy has not experienced since the 1990s. Among the criticisms leveled at the White House, by former administration officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill, is that Mr. Obama has not taken enough credit for the good things that have occurred on his watch. Nowhere has that reluctance been more evident than in his cautious reaction to a string of strong jobs reports.Despite the fact that the economy has added jobs for 57 straight months \u2014 the longest streak on record, Mr. Obama said on Friday \u2014 he has until now steadfastly avoided a triumphant tone. That is because the job growth has not been matched by wage growth, which has meant that many Americans are not feeling the benefits of the recovery.That may have changed with the November employment report. In addition to a better-than-expected growth in the number of jobs, those workers\u2019 average hourly wages rose 0.4 percent, twice what economists expected. While only a monthly number, it could suggest that wages are finally rebounding, too, which would put more cash in the pockets of working people.Mr. Obama coupled his sanguine tone with a warning to Congress not to derail the progress by shutting down the government. And, as always, he conceded a lot of work remained. But he noted that the United States was now outperforming much of the world economically \u2014 a theme he emphasized at the Group of 20 summit meeting last month in Australia.\u201cWe\u2019ve put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all other industrialized advanced countries combined,\u201d the president said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to keep at it until every single American who is willing and able to work can find not just any job but a job that pays a decent wage and allows them to support their families.\u201dThe recovery has gained enough traction, White House officials say, that Mr. Obama can afford to shake off some of his ambivalence and make a robust case for how the accelerating job growth is likely to translate into higher wages.In a speech at Northwestern University before the midterm elections as well as at a White House news conference just after the vote and in remarks to corporate executives this week, Mr. Obama has laid out a more forceful case for a broad-gauge recovery, drawing parallels to the record-setting job creation of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.Few leaders knew how to seize credit for good news like Mr. Clinton, fellow Democrats say nostalgically. In a speech at the White House in 1998, he hailed his first balanced budget as a \u201clandmark achievement,\u201d reaping enormous credit for fiscal responsibility. Having taken office during a prolonged recession, Mr. Obama has only recently been able to point to a half-decent economy. But critics say the White House has not made enough of another more promising development: the nation\u2019s evolving energy independence \u2014 a product of the boom in domestic production of oil and natural gas.Now, though, the trends in energy are converging with macroeconomic trends in a way that may address Mr. Obama\u2019s concern that middle-income people have missed out on the recovery\u2019s benefits. The steep fall in gasoline prices, economists say, is tamping down inflation, which will make people\u2019s paychecks go further.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the disconnect between the macroeconomy and middle-class lives is significant, and that gap hasn\u2019t narrowed nearly as much as it should have,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was formerly chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u201cBut the acceleration in employment growth is real, significant and important,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have to believe people are feeling it, if not in their paychecks than in their job security.\u201dFor Mr. Obama, administration officials said, striking the right tone on the economy has been a constant balancing act. In remarks to corporate executives at the Business Roundtable on Wednesday, the president noted that corporate profits were fat. But in speeches to broader audiences, Mr. Obama notes that ordinary Americans continue to struggle.\u201cDoes the president being optimistic lead to further confidence in the economy and a sense of opportunity? Or does the president being optimistic sound discordant and cause people to lose faith that they\u2019re going to get out of this?\u201d Jennifer Palmieri, the White House communications director, asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the balance we have to strike.\u201dOn Friday, as his nominee for defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, stood by him, Mr. Obama sounded as if he believed the balance had fallen clearly on the side of optimism.\u201cIf we can continue on this trajectory, if we can continue to grow robustly,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can get a virtuous cycle that\u2019s really going to make a difference and be a critical component of strengthening our national security, because national security starts with a strong economy here at home.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece Is Not Headed for the Door Just Yet", "Date": "2014-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyGreece is still several steps from chaos. Athens has entered a period of political instability that will probably lead to an election won by Syriza. This radical left group\u2019s policies could prompt Greece\u2019s exit from the euro, the so-called Grexit, if fully implemented. But for this to happen, a series of unfortunate circumstances would have to prevail.First, Parliament must fail to elect a new president. This, admittedly, is likely. A president needs the support of 60 percent of the members of Parliament, and the government can count on only just over 50 percent to support its candidate.However, there is a slim chance that Prime Minister Antonis Samaras can persuade enough members to switch sides to cross the threshold. There is also a small chance that the conservative prime minister himself will be replaced by a technocrat as the price for cobbling together the majority needed to elect a president.In either case, Athens could resume negotiations with the so-called troika of international lenders \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 about future financial support. Greece would have to agree to tighten its 2015 budget a bit, continue with structural reforms and accept monitoring of its economic actions. It would be easier to swallow these conditions after a successful presidential election.In return, Athens would receive a final dollop of cash from its current bailout program and a precautionary credit line from the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund. It might also get more time to repay the money it has borrowed from the eurozone. With all this in place, Greece could tap the bond markets to finance itself.However, the government will probably not be able to secure the election of a president. Although the post is largely ceremonial, the constitution says there would then have to be a general election.If Mr. Samaras won that election, which would be held around the end of January, he could then continue negotiations with the troika. He would seek to scare voters into backing him by painting a lurid picture of what a Syriza government would do.But it is unlikely Mr. Samaras would succeed. Alexis Tsipras, the Syriza boss, has a solid lead in public opinion polls. He would almost certainly emerge with the largest party.If Syriza implemented its program, the prospects for Greece would be bleak. Among its string of populist policies are plans to write off a chunk of the government\u2019s debt and expand public spending. Both ideas would provoke a confrontation with the troika that would put Athens on the fast track to bankruptcy.While the eurozone might be prepared to vary the terms of Greece\u2019s borrowings, it would not accept a write-off. Nor would it agree to let Athens renege on a commitment to control the country\u2019s budget deficit. Mr. Tsipras would not be able to blackmail the eurozone because a Greek bankruptcy would probably not lead to domino defaults elsewhere.Without a deal with the troika, Athens would not be able to access the bond market and would run out of money. There would then probably be a run on the banks, followed by capital controls. If Mr. Tsipras still did not come into line, Grexit would loom.The good news, though, is that this particular scenario is improbable, albeit possible. One reason is that Syriza might well buckle when it saw that the troika wouldn\u2019t budge.Another reason is that, even though Syriza is highly likely to be the largest party after a general election, it is unlikely to get an overall majority. To form a government, it would probably need support from one or both of two center-left parties: Pasok or To Potami. Both of these are pro-European and would tend not to sign up to a program that involved charging over the precipice.Syriza might struggle to form a government at all, because the compromises it would need to make to win over these other parties would be hard to sell to its radical wing.In that case, there would have to be a second election. While it is hard to predict how that would play out, the conservatives might make a comeback \u2014 especially if they ditched the unpopular Mr. Samaras and replaced him with somebody like Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a younger, more centrist leader.Replacing Mr. Samaras might actually be the best outcome. Although Mr. Samaras is preferable to Mr. Tsipras, he has been an erratic leader. His most recent error was to promise prematurely that Athens would exit its bailout program \u2014 a move that frightened the markets and so made it impossible to secure a clean exit. This was terrible timing, as Greece had finally turned the corner after its terrible recession.The ancient Greeks believed in Tyche, the goddess of luck. Sometimes she brought good luck, sometimes bad luck.Tyche is stalking her homeland again. Political risk has shot up. The various scenarios and sub-scenarios have multiplied. One of these \u2014 a Syriza government that implemented its populist policies \u2014 would spell disaster. But this is not the most likely outcome. And other scenarios are more benign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " State Aid Formula Said to Hurt in a District Where Most Go to Yeshivas ", "Date": "2014-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe school board fired back, saying it was the state that was starving the district, effectively forcing a cut of 200 teachers, a reduction from full-day to half-day kindergarten and a shrinking of sports and other extracurricular activities. The school district, the board said, was being shortchanged by a state aid formula that classifies it as having more than enough resources to pay for adequate schooling when, by measures like the number of pupils qualifying for federally-subsidized lunches, the district is actually one of the state\u2019s poorest.\u201cThe state says we\u2019re a very wealthy district; the feds say we\u2019re a very poor district,\u201d Yehuda Weissmandl, the board\u2019s president, said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the same district we\u2019re talking about.\u201dThe dispute has been raging for years, with public-school parents, many of whom are Latino and Haitian, and school officials confronting each other in angry exchanges, and board members, seven of whom are Orthodox Jews, sealing themselves in frequent executive sessions. But it reached a crossroads with the report in November to the Board of Regents by the monitor, Henry M. Greenberg, who declared bluntly: \u201cThe board appears to favor the interest of private schools over public schools.\u201dHe faulted the district for many sins: fiscal mismanagement, spending too much money on transportation and special education assistance for the yeshivas, hiring $650-an-hour lawyers, selling two public schools to yeshiva operators at bargain-basement prices, and of fractious relations with the community \u2014 a charge some board members concede, and are trying to repair, by promising simultaneous Spanish translation of all meetings.Mr. Greenberg proposed that the State Legislature appoint a fiscal monitor with the power to overrule the nine-member board\u2019s decisions.Still, he acknowledged that the district, financially imprudent as it had been, needed more aid. That is something the Legislature would have to do, though lawmakers have been loath to tinker with the aid formula for fear of opening a Pandora\u2019s box: Every district, after all, wants more money.Interviews with state officials, current and former school board members and public-school community leaders indicate that the formula does seem to give the district less than it needs to fully finance the school system.State education officials, however, point out that East Ramapo\u2019s aid is augmented by other factors in the formula that credit the district for having large numbers of poor children. They also say that the formula applies to all the state\u2019s nearly 700 school districts, many of which have their own inequities.Still, there is a disparity that hurts East Ramapo, which encompasses all or parts of Spring Valley, Monsey, Nanuet and Chestnut Ridge. The area has experienced a huge growth of Hasidic and other Orthodox Jewish families, almost all of whom send children to yeshivas. The state provides an average of 40 percent of a district\u2019s budget, with wealthier districts getting less and poorer ones more. East Ramapo, however, receives 32.9 percent of its revenue from the state, putting a bigger burden on local taxpayers, who have often balked at paying more.The formula, known as the Combined Wealth Ratio, is complicated, but in its simplest terms it determines how many students attend public schools and how much wealth the district has to pay for each public school student. In East Ramapo, there are 9,000 public school students and 24,000 private school students in over 50 yeshivas.When the total value of taxable property in the district is divided solely by the district\u2019s number of public school students, board officials say, East Ramapo seems to have more than enough money to pay for each of its students; more than a neighboring town, Clarkstown, which also has about 9,000 public students, but far fewer private school students. With equivalent wealth ratios, the state may send as much money per student to Clarkstown as it does to East Ramapo.Harry Phillips III, a longtime member of the Board of Regents and a fierce critic of East Ramapo\u2019s management, acknowledged in an interview that the formula \u201churts East Ramapo because their proportion of private and public school students is the worst in the state.\u201d He said a similar situation prevailed in another locale with a large Orthodox Jewish population, Lawrence, on Long Island, and in his hometown district of Greenburgh, in Westchester County, where large proportions of students attend private and parochial schools.A majority of East Ramapo\u2019s 9,000 public school students are indigent; 77 percent qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. Many are children of immigrants and need extra teachers who can provide language classes and remedial reading programs. In contrast, only 6 percent of Clarkstown\u2019s pupils were eligible for a free lunch in 2011.In the 2010-2011, school year, the last year for which fully comparable figures were available, East Ramapo, with a $113 million budget, spent $14,398 per general education pupil (not including those with disabilities), while Clarkstown spent $9,897, yet they received similar amounts of state aid per pupil.District leaders estimate that they are losing up to $30 million a year in aid to general education they might have gotten had the formula treated them like a district with a roughly comparable economic profile. They cite Mount Vernon, N.Y., whose 10,000 public school students received $76 million in the basic state allotment known as \u201cfoundation aid\u201d while East Ramapo received about $43 million. The major difference, said Mr. Weissmandl, a Hasidic real estate developer who has been on the school board for three years, is that Mount Vernon has only 1,000 students in private schools.\u201cWe\u2019re considered very wealthy,\" Mr. Weissmandl said.East Ramapo, like all other districts, is hurting because of large cuts in state aid enacted years ago to close a state budget gap, according to the New York State School Boards Association. Though the association acknowledges that East Ramapo could use more money, it is strongly opposed to counting private school students in the foundation aid formula.When Mr. Greenberg looked into the disparity, according to people familiar with his conversations with education officials who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on his behalf, he found that the district used an inordinate proportion of its scarce funding \u2014 37 percent \u2014 for transportation and special education. The state average is 26 percent. Since much of that money is spent on private school students, school officials have had to make cuts in instruction and extracurricular activities for public schools.The school board argues that it is mandated to bus all students as a result of ballot questions passed by local voters at referendums. But the board, Mr. Greenberg told education officials, also has the power to make the bus system, which has about 300 routes, including yeshiva buses segregated by sex, more efficient and less costly. It could also lobby voters to pass a law that excludes busing for, say, students who live a quarter-mile or less from schools.Similarly, Mr. Greenberg found that the board had not contested what some call \u201cCadillac\u201d placements for disabled students in yeshiva-based settings or in the special-education schools of Kiryas Joel, a Hasidic village in Orange County that operates its own public school system for disabled students. The state has withheld reimbursement for some students because they could have gotten instruction of equivalent quality in public settings.Mr. Weissmandl, 39, a father of seven, insists that he is not going out of his way to favor yeshivas.\u201cI want every child to get the best education possible,\u201d he said.\u201d \u201cI care about every child because I want people to care about my children. Public school education drives the local economy and the quality of local neighborhoods and our future years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texan to Help Mongolia Sort Out Its Finances", "Date": "2014-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Early next year, John Barton will step off a plane and look out over the snow-capped foothills surrounding the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator. It is one of the most remote corners of the world \u2014 and if all goes well, it is where Mr. Barton, a longtime budget writer for the State of Texas, will spend the next two to three years.Mr. Barton is a resident adviser for the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Technical Assistance, which embeds American financial and budget specialists in governments overseas. He will be in Mongolia to share his budget-planning skills, honed over 30 years in Texas government working for the Legislative Budget Board, the nonpartisan agency that prepares the state\u2019s biennial budget documents.Texas has been fertile ground for these boots-on-the-ground advisers, with four, including Mr. Barton, from Texas; there are more budget advisers from Texas than from any other state, said an agency spokeswoman, Holly Shulman. Sheila Beckett, a former budget director for Gov. Bill Clements and Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, is now a senior adviser to the Office of Technical Assistance program. Previously, Ms. Beckett served overseas in the post-conflict Balkan nations of Macedonia and Serbia. Her job duties now involve looking for recruits, like Mr. Barton.The prevalence of Texans in the program is at least partially explained by the size of the state \u2014 there are more budget writers to choose from. But Ms. Beckett also pointed to Texas\u2019 early adoption of zero-base budgeting, which, unlike traditional budgeting, has departments start at zero and then justify their spending requests. She said the practice gives Texas budget planners expertise that is valuable to countries that have not used the process. Larry McDonald, the deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Technical Assistance, added that Texas is known as a national leader in budget transparency. The state\u2019s geographic size is also relatable to a lot of the countries where the agency operates, he said.The Treasury Department began sending budget specialists overseas more than 20 years ago. The department established the Office of Technical Assistance after the fall of the Berlin Wall to support Eastern Bloc governments as they moved to democracies and market-based economies. Since then, its scope of work has expanded to developing and transitional countries.The office embeds American financial experts overseas in order to mentor their counterparts on good processes and procedures \u2014 not to influence policy, Ms. Beckett said.Ms. Beckett described the resident adviser\u2019s job as \u201ccapacity building,\u201d working with younger staff members in foreign governments with the expectation that they will eventually rise to the top of their agencies.\u201cWe work inside the government, sitting side by side with the government counterparts,\u201d Ms. Beckett said. \u201cMany of the other aid institutions are outside the government. They sit in consultants\u2019 offices. They don\u2019t have the access to the government workers that the Treasury advisers do.\u201dMr. Barton expects few similarities between Texas and Mongolia. Geographically, the country is bigger than Texas \u2014 and at 3.2 million residents, it has roughly an eighth of Texas\u2019 population. A third of those Mongolians still maintain the country\u2019s traditional nomadic lifestyle.Add a severe language barrier \u2014 \u201cRosetta Stone does not offer Mongolian,\u201d Mr. Barton said, joking \u2014 and the new posting feels particularly daunting. But Mr. Barton said it was a thrilling midcareer move. \u201cThis kind of opportunity is such that I\u2019d be happy to show up with a sleeping bag and a couple of bottles of hot sauce and work for free,\u201d Mr. Barton said.jreynolds@texastribune. orgAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Wasn\u2019t the Only Story in 2014", "Date": "2014-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Year in SportsThe year began with the sports world worried about Russia, and it ended the same way.\u201cProjections of Russian soft power like Sochi and the World Cup are designed to have the rest of the world view Russia as a benign place where you can do business and admire the culture and send your children to get educated,\u201d said Robert Edelman, a professor of Russian history and the history of sport at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve squandered that.\u201dIt remains to be calculated how much the Russians squandered of their $51 billion, a record figure that later scared off bidders for the 2022 Winter Olympics. But much of that money was spent on infrastructure in a region that chose to construct plenty of it to service its new winter sports facilities.\u201cWe knew that in Sochi there was nothing there and that was the idea,\u201d said Anita DeFrantz, a longtime International Olympic Committee member from the United States. \u201cIt was not a secret, not a surprise. We just didn\u2019t do a good job explaining it once we made that decision.\u201dThe payoff on the I.O.C.'s big gamble and Russia\u2019s massive investment will come (or not) in the after-use. The environmental impact already should send a shudder through the I.O.C., which likes to see itself as green. Sochi\u2019s Olympic Park near the Black Sea certainly looks like an excellent habitat for white elephants, although the Russians did use some of the bells and whistles for a new Formula One Grand Prix in October and for something called the World Robot Olympiad in November. The Bolshoy Ice Dome is now home to a Kontinental Hockey League team, and Fisht Stadium \u2014 site of the opening and closing ceremonies during the Olympics in February \u2014 is to be used for the 2018 soccer World Cup.The San Antonio Spurs, with a veteran lineup, channeled their bruised pride and team spirit into another National Basketball Association title, convincingly taking out LeBron James and the Miami Heat in the finals. Real Madrid, after another round of big spending on big-time talent (see Gareth Bale), won its 10th Champions League title, although it needed a nick-of-time header from the defender Sergio Ramos to wriggle free of crosstown rival Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the final.The San Francisco Giants rode the pitching of Madison Bumgarner (as a starter and a reliever) to their third World Series victory in five seasons. China piled up the medals, as usual, at the Asian Games. England and Australia piled them up as usual at the Commonwealth Games.At the Winter Olympics, Canada swept the men\u2019s and women\u2019s gold medals in hockey, just as it had in Vancouver four years earlier. The Sochi sweep certainly caused more pain in Russia, where the men\u2019s team could not muster even a medal. Coach Zinetula Bilyaletdinov summed up the mood after the elimination by responding to a line of inquiry with, \u201cWell then, eat me alive right now.\u201dThe Russians settled instead for Bilyaletdinov\u2019s resignation. They then went out with a new coach, the Latvian Oleg Znarok, and won the world championships in May, which was about three months late, unfortunately.By then it was clearly a good news-bad news year for Russia. The Russian teenager Adelina Sotnikova won one of the most prestigious gold medals in Sochi, upsetting South Korea\u2019s Kim Yu-na in the women\u2019s figure-skating event. But questions were immediately raised about the judging, and the Korean Olympic Committee and Korean Skating Union later filed two official complaints with the International Skating Union about the composition and objectivity of the panel. Neither complaint was upheld.Russia went on to lead the medal count in Sochi, ahead of Norway, Canada and the United States. But Russian officials then had to deny allegations that some of its athletes had benefited from the use of xenon gas products that were not banned during the Games but later placed on a prohibited list by the World Anti-Doping Agency because of their endurance-boosting properties.Dick Pound, the former head of the doping agency, was assigned to head a panel investigating the allegations, which were deemed \u201cslanderous\u201d by Valentin Balakhnichev, head of the Russian track and field federation.Russia had other problems, of course. It might have had the means to spend $51 billion on a Winter Olympics but its soccer federation later lacked the means to pay its national team coach, Fabio Capello, whose team was eliminated before the knockout round in Brazil without winning a game.Imagine how much the Sochi Games would have cost with the ruble at 55 to the dollar instead of 35. Imagine how much the 2018 World Cup might cost if the ruble remains at 55 to the dollar.With a new year looming, Russia\u2019s worries and the world\u2019s worries about Russia appear far from over.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " Decline of a Political Family Opens the Way for a Shift in Brazil ", "Date": "2014-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3o Lu\u00cds JournalA documentary depicts Mr. Sarney as a generously mustachioed governor lifting Maranh\u00e3o ( pronounced mar-ah-NEEOW) from its economic isolation in the 1960s. Photos capture him presiding over Brazil\u2019s transition to civilian rule in the 1980s. A display of titles, including \u201cMaster of the Sea,\u201d show his literary prowess as a novelist-statesman.Outside the Convento das Merc\u00eas, which houses a state-financed foundation heralding Mr. Sarney, residents are quick to point out the family\u2019s mark all around S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, the state capital.Need a place to live? Consider the neighborhood of Vila Sarney, they joke. A hospital? There is the Maternidade Marly Sarney. Want to check out a book? Try the Jos\u00e9 Sarney Library. Need to go to the old center? Take the Jos\u00e9 Sarney Bridge.And if you have a problem, you can always file a lawsuit \u2014 at the Sarney Costa Courthouse.But all the visible celebration of Mr. Sarney now stands in sharp contrast to the way the patriarch, 84, and his offspring are widely perceived both in Maranh\u00e3o, one of Brazil\u2019s poorest states, and the rest of Brazil.Voters ousted Mr. Sarney\u2019s political loyalists in Maranh\u00e3o in state elections in October, and Mr. Sarney, long one of Brazil\u2019s most powerful men from his perch in the Senate, announced that he would not seek re-election, possibly opening the way for one of the more profound shifts in Brazilian politics in recent years.\u201cThe last great colonels of Brazil are finally in decline,\u201d said Rodrigo Lago, a lawyer and transparency activist, using the term for the strongmen asserting power over big areas of Brazil, largely here in the nation\u2019s poor northeast.\u201cIf Maranh\u00e3o can change, then oligarchies elsewhere can be curbed in this country,\u201d he added.Similarly, voters recently thwarted the son of Jader Barbalho \u2014 a powerful senator with a regional media empire who has long battled corruption charges \u2014 from being elected governor of Par\u00e1, the huge state in the Amazon bordering Maranh\u00e3o.Of course, powerful political families are resilient, and dynasties can always mount a comeback. In Alagoas, one of Brazil\u2019s poorest states, the 34-year-old son of Renan Calheiros, the president of Brazil\u2019s Senate, was elected governor in October.While President Dilma Rousseff is from the leftist Workers Party, she has little choice but to forge alliances with centrist or conservative parties, some led by old-school political chiefs.But here in the Sarney bastion of Maranh\u00e3o, many people are sanguine about the chances of finally turning a corner.\u201cWe\u2019re done with the Sarneys, who stayed in power just to enrich themselves,\u201d said Sueli Celeste, 48, the secretary at a school near the Convento das Merc\u00eas in the old center of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, which abounds in one derelict palazzo after another.\u201cHide your phone when you walk around here,\u201d she added. \u201cThe crack addicts will steal it if they see you taking pictures.\u201dThe roots of resentment are not hard to see. Maranh\u00e3o remains one of Brazil\u2019s poorest states, with many of its people eking out an existence as subsistence farmers.Yet the Sarney family has managed to assemble a powerful collection of mass media holdings, including the newspaper O Estado de Maranh\u00e3o and TV Mirante, an affiliate of the Globo television network, enabling the clan to celebrate its achievements and attack its critics.\u201cThe media constantly extol the great things Sarney and his allies have done and are doing,\u201d said Sean Mitchell, an anthropologist at Rutgers University who has conducted extensive research in Maranh\u00e3o. \u201cDespite this, the provision of public services by the Sarney family and allied officeholders is terrible.\u201dMaranh\u00e3o ranks second to last among Brazil\u2019s 26 states in the United Nations Human Development Index, a comprehensive measure of factors like education levels, incomes and life expectancy.Writing this year in his Sunday column in O Estado de Maranh\u00e3o, the Sarney family\u2019s newspaper, Mr. Sarney argued that the development index was created as a strategy by \u201cimperialist countries\u201d to exploit weaknesses in the developing world.\u201cThis is the index they crow about when they want to talk bad about Brazil and worse about Maranh\u00e3o,\u201d he said. (The index was actually created by a Nobel laureate from India and a former finance minister of Pakistan).Fl\u00e1vio Dino, a former judge and member of the Communist Party of Brazil, glided to victory in the governor\u2019s race in October against the candidate allied with the Sarney family by campaigning on a platform of raising living standards.Mr. Sarney was born in a town in the interior of Maranh\u00e3o in 1930 as Jos\u00e9 Ribamar Ferreira de Ara\u00fajo Costa. He took his father\u2019s foreign-sounding first name, Sarney, made it into a surname and began a political career with few parallels in Brazil.A supporter of a coup in 1964 that ushered in a military dictatorship, he thrived during authoritarian rule before emerging in 1984 as the running mate of Tancredo Neves, the leader of Brazil\u2019s restoration of democracy. Elected president in 1985, Mr. Neves died of complications from intestinal surgery before taking office, opening the way for Mr. Sarney\u2019s rise to power.Some in Maranh\u00e3o doubt that the Sarney family will now sit back and simply watch its opponents wield power. In fact, Ms. Sarney was knocked out of the governor\u2019s palace once before, after the election of an opposition governor in 2006.But he was ousted in the face of criticism in Sarney-controlled news media over vote-buying accusations, enabling Ms. Sarney to step in and replace him.Her father, the family patriarch, remains defiant even at the end of his long political career. Writing in his Sunday column about the \u201cnew Maranh\u00e3o,\u201d Mr. Sarney said the state resembled \u201ca body without a head\u201d before he became governor in the 1960s.\u201cToday\u2019s generation has no notion of that struggle; the largest victory of all was changing the mentality of Maranh\u00e3o,\u201d Mr. Sarney said. \u201cIt was so strong that it produced a president of the republic, and Maranh\u00e3o emerged as one of the most important states in the country.\u201dAn earlier version of the summary with this article misidentified the Brazilian state that Jos\u00e9 Sarney has been representing in the Senate. As the article correctly notes, it is Amap\u00e1, not Maranh\u00e3o.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fed Fights Half the Battle ", "Date": "2014-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAt its recent meeting, the last of the the year, the Federal Reserve said it was in no great hurry to lift interest rates \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing. Higher rates make sense when a strong job market pushes up wages and consumer prices. Currently, though, job growth is still too slow, unemployment too high, raises too measly and inflation too low to warrant a rate increase. The challenge for the Fed is to hold rates low without inflating bubbles. The way to do so is to control speculation through stepped-up regulation of banks and other financial institutions. Instead, the Fed has been inclined to ease up on regulation. The Fed has pressed the banks to raise more capital, which cushions them \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 against catastrophic losses. But its belief in more capital as a fail-safe bulwark against calamity is misplaced. The way capital is calculated leaves the banks free to engage in risky derivatives transactions without adequate capital to absorb potential losses. By keeping rates low, the Fed is adhering to its dual mandate to foster full employment and ensure price stability. But prolonged periods of low interest rates demand extra vigilance against speculation.Advertisement"}

Although the country faces many difficult challenges, it remains a symbol of hope and sanity in a region consumed by chaos and dominated by authoritarian governments.American officials and experts who know Mr. Essebsi expect him to be an inclusive leader who will work to advance liberal goals like women\u2019s rights and education. While he will have to satisfy his secular, Western-oriented supporters, one of Mr. Essebsi\u2019s biggest challenges will be cooperating with Ennahda, the country\u2019s Islamist party, which has worked hard to prove that Islam and democracy can coexist. Ennahda swept to power in the 2011 post-revolution elections, led a coalition government for two years, then handed power \u2014 peacefully \u2014 to a caretaker government. This paved the way for Parliament to adopt a new, more progressive Constitution that expanded civil liberties. While Tunisia\u2019s commitment to elections and other democratic processes has been inspiring, building deep roots for the democratic institutions and values that can stand the test of time will take years. Still, the country offers more hope than any other Muslim country shaken by the 2011 political upheavals and deserves as much political and economic support as the United States and Europe can muster.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Say Art Is Dead in New York. They\u2019re Wrong.", "Date": "2014-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYear-End CultureThe invitation came by email: I was to present myself at 9 p.m. that Saturday in the lobby of the New Yorker Hotel on Eighth Avenue and 34th Street. Without explanation, I was told to come alone, dress warmly, bring a bottle of bourbon and, on arrival, keep an eye out for a mysterious \u201cagent\u201d in a red beret.What ended up happening that night was proof that it was not. At the appointed hour, 15 or 20 of us gathered in the lobby, eyeing one another and trying to blend into a crowd of innocent tourists. A few minutes later, the agent, indeed in a beret, rose from a sofa and strolled out the door.All of us followed as she ducked around the corner and whisked us into a building \u2014 a large commercial structure, empty, dusty, obviously under construction. With no idea where we were going, we were led up 16 flights of stairs, in the dark, and then out onto the roof. There we saw the elevator room, a small brick box, which had been converted into a cramped, clandestine jazz club. A barman in a trilby offered cocktails; a chandelier of candles dangled from the ceiling. As the night went on, musicians played, an illusionist performed and the assorted guests \u2014 painters, filmmakers, an aerialist just back from Brazil \u2014 stood among the huge industrial motors, talking about the only-in-New-York-ness of it all, which was, of course, the point.Somehow, in the last few years, it has become an article of faith that New York has lost its artistic spirit, that the city\u2019s long run as a capital of culture is over. After all (or so the argument goes), foreign oligarchs and hedge-fund traders have bought up all the real estate, chased away the artists and turned the bohemia that once ran east from Chumley\u2019s clear across the Williamsburg Bridge into a soulless playground of money.Acknowledging the city\u2019s rising affluence in order to oppose it, this neo-New York School tends to look at obstacles like security deposits \u2014 or security guards \u2014 as potential opportunities, and does so with a rebel zeal for reclaiming the streets.\u201cI\u2019ve been here for a decade and a half,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m always finding something new. There\u2019s an amazing productive energy here \u2014 it\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s refreshing. You never exhaust New York.\u201dIn mid-November, the artist Jeff Stark took part in a panel discussion on performance at Parsons the New School for Design. During the Q. and A., a guy in the crowd raised his hand and started in on the arts scene in New York.\u201cIt was that classic argument,\u201d Mr. Stark recalled. \u201c 'Where\u2019s the city of Andy Warhol? Where\u2019s the city of Patti Smith? Why are artists even coming here today?\u2019 I had to tell him people are coming here because it\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u201cWhenever people ask me if New York is over, my response is that the coolest stuff I\u2019ve seen here has been in the last two years,\u201d said Mr. Stark, who is 42 and has lived in the city since 1999. \u201cArtists make art that reflects the space they\u2019re in, and since we\u2019re in New York, which is expensive, people have started making crazy outdoor art or temporary, pop-up stuff \u2014 weird, little culture happenings, sometimes in public places, sometimes in the middle of the night.\u201dSetting aside the effect of that war zone on ordinary people, the hypothesis seems questionable. Is it really the case that public chaos inspires creativity? That art not only thrives, but thrives best, in an atmosphere of lawlessness and danger?What I heard time and again from the artists I talked to was that they were sick of being told how gritty and awesome the city used to be and how corporatized and boring it was now. Some said the complainers were simply looking back on their youth through rose-colored glasses. (\u201cPeople get old,\u201d Mr. Stark shrugged. \u201cThey don\u2019t get out as much.\u201d) Some just didn\u2019t believe the myth. (\u201cI used to go to CBGB,\u201d Mr. Hackett said. \u201cCBGB was a rathole.\u201d) Others were annoyed by the glamorizing of disorder, especially by artists who had escaped it into success, doubly-especially when so many younger artists are trying hard to subvert New York\u2019s more regimented climate through their work.Mike Tummolo, for instance, is a founding member of the Junxion, the group that drives around in school buses with Merry Prankster nicknames, like the Mighty Bird and the Music Wagon. Mr. Tummolo has been putting on events in the city for more than a decade, and acknowledged that things were simpler years ago when space was less expensive and even raucous gatherings were more or less ignored by the police. But it was only after he and his partners, in response to financial and security pressures, literally took their act on the road that they felt they had accomplished something.\u201cIt was bumming us out that everything had to be so legal these days,\u201d he said. \u201cFire codes, liquor licenses, whatever. But then we thought, \u2018Wait a second, do we even really need a space? We\u2019ve got five school buses at our disposal. We can go wherever we want.' \u201d Now, he said, the city\u2019s entire landscape is his nightclub. \u201cThe magic,\u201d he said, \u201cis still happening.\u201dYou hear a lot these days about Detroit, New Orleans, Minneapolis \u2014 fresh new meccas where the rent is cheap and the cops don\u2019t hassle you, man. They have that vibe, people say, that edge that New York used to have. There\u2019s a real community thing going on.When I went to talk with people at the Silent Barn this month, they told me the place was struggling but surviving, largely on the income from renting out artist studios and rooms (for about $800 a month) and from the bar, which, they joked, has taken the place of the traditional angel donor. But they also said communal living wasn\u2019t just about sharing groceries or the gas bill; it was, as well, a way of fending off the alienating aspects of the artist\u2019s life.\u201cIn some sense, the nightmare in New York isn\u2019t being broke, it\u2019s being stuck in a shoe box writing emails into the void asking to play at someone\u2019s bar or to do a show at someone\u2019s gallery,\u201d said Joe Ahearn, a founding member of the space. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of things we don\u2019t do well, but one thing we do do well is to combat that kind of isolation.\u201d\u201cTo survive for the long term, we have to grow up and have adult conversations about stuff like loans and workers\u2019 compensation,\u201d said Nathan Cearley, a Silent Barn veteran, who also works as a schoolteacher, plays in a \u201cvoid drone\u201d band called Long Distance Poison and serves on the collective\u2019s working group for logistical issues, which is known as Risky Bizness.\u201cI don\u2019t see David Byrne investing in real estate and trying to lower prices so that artists can stay here,\u201d Mr. Cearley said. (Mr. Byrne responded in an email that he failed to see how a real-estate investment, \u201ceven if I had the spare cash,\u201d would lower rents for artists.)Mr. Cearley then went on: \u201cIf David Byrne isn\u2019t interested in art anymore\u201d \u2014 in his email Mr. Byrne said that he was \u2014 \u201cI suppose that\u2019s good to know. But we are. So instead complaining about the end of art in New York, I\u2019d love to see him save it. Because he can write us a check anytime he wants.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Catskills, the Long Wait for a Casino Nears an End", "Date": "2014-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONTICELLO, N.Y. \u2014 Robert A. Berman is a son of the Catskills, deeply rooted in an era when the borscht belt hotels and bungalow colonies attracted visitors from across the country.His father, Pip Berman, was a building contractor who spent much of his career expanding the legendary Concord, which featured a 1,200-room hotel and the Imperial Room nightclub, where Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett, Joan Rivers and Jerry Seinfeld performed.Robert Berman spent over a decade of his life in a failed attempt to build a casino at the Monticello Raceway that he hoped would revive a Sullivan County in desperate straits, after most of the hotels and the tourism economy had collapsed.\u201cThis is the medicine you need to revive the area,\u201d Mr. Berman said.It was a sentiment repeated time and again on Wednesday night and on Thursday, when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo arrived at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts to promote the new project.Mr. Cuomo had led a campaign to expand gambling north and west of New York City as part of an economic development strategy to revitalize struggling areas, while providing jobs and revenues. After an eight-month review, the location board recommended a casino license for three of 16 proposed casino resorts, one in each of three regions.\u201cThe Catskills were close to dying,\u201d said Scott Smith, 46, a union carpenter. \u201cIt was heartbreaking last year to see Kutsher\u2019s close, the last of the big resorts. I\u2019ve always been a little leery of gambling. But I believe that with this kind of resort you\u2019ll see the shops reopen on Broadway again.\u201dHe was referring to the storefronts along Broadway in downtown Monticello that sit vacant and forlorn. At the edge of town, the old Apollo shopping center is stripped bare and rusting. A few billboards for kosher restaurants on the highway nearby fight for attention with ads for a Harley-Davidson motorcycle shop. Sullivan County\u2019s unemployment and poverty rates remain stubbornly above the state average.The developers of the resort on 1,700 acres of the Concord property hope to break ground within three months. They must complete an environmental review, undergo a background check by the State Police and get final approval from the State Gaming Commission.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to getting this done,\u201d said Emanuel R. Pearlman, chairman of Empire Resorts, which will build the casino. \u201cWe have fully committed financing and our environmental review is done.\u201dEmpire Resorts will erect the Montreign Resort Casino and a 391-room hotel. Its partner, EPR Properties, will build the Adelaar Resort, with a water parks, retail shops, cabins, a movie theater, hiking and biking trails and zip lines.\u201cWe\u2019re part of a resort; we\u2019re not just about gaming,\u201d Mr. Pearlman said. \u201cGiven all the concern about casino saturation, we think there\u2019s a greater likelihood of success because of all the other things around the casino.\u201dMr. Pearlman said the resort would be working closely with the Monticello Motor Club, a private racetrack, and Bethel Woods, a performance site, to enhance tourism in the area.Still, the Catskills are roughly the same distance from New York City \u2014 with its 8.3 million residents and 52 million annual tourists a year \u2014 as rival Pennsylvania casinos in the Poconos, Bethlehem and Philadelphia. And New Jersey legislators are debating whether to put a casino in the Meadowlands.\u201cCasinos in the Catskills will have a challenge,\u201d said Alex Bumazhny, an analyst for Fitch Ratings, \u201cbecause the Northeast is pretty saturated.\u201dBut Mr. Pearlman said his business model relied on the 1.8 million adults who live within 60 miles of the Concord, and not a huge stream of business from New York City.The Concord tract lies in Thompson, just outside Monticello. The hotel was demolished years ago, the tennis courts plowed under and the swimming pools filled in. The new casino will rise where an abandoned bungalow colony now sits.During its heyday from 1940 through the 1960s, tens of thousands of people packed into the borscht belt\u2019s 500 hotels, 1,000 rooming houses and 50,000 bungalows. Many were working-class and middle-class families, mostly Jewish, from New York City seeking a respite from the summer heat.The Concord and Grossinger\u2019s, in Liberty, were the best known, in part because of the performers who would take the stage.But the Catskills were undone by the advent of cheap airfares in the 1970s, and the popularity of European vacations. One hotel after another closed over the following decades. The Concord, whose roots went back to the 1930s, filed for bankruptcy in 1997 and was later torn down.Some elected officials, hotel owners and developers tried and failed to persuade state legislators that commercial casinos were the path to survival.In the mid-1990s, Robert Berman bought the crumbling Monticello racetrack with plans to give 30 acres of land to an Indian tribe, who could then legally build a casino. In 2000, Mr. Berman and the St. Regis Mohawk tribe got preliminary federal approval for a casino. But Caesars Entertainment, then the largest casino company, lured away the tribe, telling the Mohawk chiefs it could get approval for a casino at Kutsher\u2019s.Neither project moved forward. Nor did a plan by Louis R. Cappelli, a developer, to build a casino at the Concord with the Mohegan tribe.\u201cWe finally reached the golden carrot that\u2019s been dangling in front of us for so long,\u201d said Anthony P. Cellini, the town supervisor of Thompson for 20 years before he retired last year. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be back as the hospitality capital of the Northeast. This is not a cure-all, but it\u2019s a huge stop in the right direction.\u201dThe prospect of a casino-resort under Andrew Cuomo\u2019s administration prompted a 32-year old memory for Mr. Berman. He recalled his father, who was dying of cancer, asking him to attend a groundbreaking in Fallsburg in the early 1980s. At the event, he was excited to get to shake the hand of a then first-term governor, Mario M. Cuomo.Mr. Berman said that in his speech, Governor Cuomo \u201cgave his word that he would see the Catskills revitalized through casino gambling and that Atlantic City would not stand alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
