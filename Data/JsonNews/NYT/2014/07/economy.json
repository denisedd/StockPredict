{"Headline": "Paid Leave Encourages Female Employees to Stay ", "Date": "2014-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen at WorkA mysterious fact that economists are wrestling with is that the percentage of women in the United States who are working or want to work has been declining, after a decades-long climb.A series of changes helped women enter the work force in the last three decades of the 20th century, including the Civil Rights Act, the earned-income tax credit, the birth control pill and technology in the home. But then participation began to drop \u2014 even as women in some cases became more qualified workers than men (women earn 59 percent of higher education degrees, for instance).In the last decade, the report points out, other developed countries adopted a variety of policies to help working parents, like paid family leave, subsidized child care and support for part-time work. The United States, meanwhile, did very little, which is why it no longer leads European countries in female labor force participation.The United States is the only developed country not to offer paid maternity leave as part of federal policy. Just 59 percent of workers say their employers offer them paid leave, according to the council.\u201cWhen people have paid leave, it just gives them a path back to work, whereas when they drop out of the labor force and stop working in order to take a leave with a young child, they come back slower,\u201d Ms. Stevenson said.At a place like Google, the cost of paid maternity leave was less than the cost of recruiting another highly skilled employee. At low-skilled jobs, though, the calculus shifts, because workers are more easily replaceable. That has led to increased inequality, because high-skilled workers tend to have paid leave while low-skilled ones do not.Even fewer employers offer paternity leave. Although it would be unlikely to increase the number of men who work \u2014 men rarely quit when they have children \u2014 paternity leave might help increase women\u2019s labor force participation by involving men more at home and making it easier for women to work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Hidden Credit Card Bill", "Date": "2014-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBOSTON \u2014 HOUSEHOLDS can\u2019t spend, on a continuing basis, more than they earn. Countries can\u2019t either, at least not over the long run. But countries can certainly leave the bill for their current spending to the young and to future generations. Official borrowing is the old-fashioned way to do this: Sell Treasury bonds, and other securities, and spend the proceeds. But borrowing in broad daylight has a drawback: The more you do it, the more lenders worry about repayment, and the more interest they charge for their loans.So there\u2019s a different way to borrow \u2014 one that\u2019s more subtle, harder to see and, therefore, cheaper to do. You still take in money, pledge to return it, and leave future generations on the hook. But you call the money you take in \u201ctaxes,\u201d not \u201cborrowing.\u201d And you promise repayment in the form of pension, health care and other benefits, but you don\u2019t record the present value of those promises as official debt.Social Security is backed by something perhaps even more powerful than the full faith and credit of the government: the political power of some 100 million Americans 50 and older.My 94-year-old mom is in this demographic. She\u2019s collecting Social Security retirement benefits based on her 35 years of payroll tax payments, first as a university administrator and then as a printing broker. She\u2019s also receiving widow\u2019s benefits based on my dad\u2019s 30-year work history at Kotlikoff\u2019s, the department store in Camden, N.J., that he owned with his brothers. Every month, my mom receives a yellow and green benefit check for $1,600 from the Treasury. I expect she\u2019ll keep collecting those Social Security checks for a long time. She\u2019s crushing 50-year-olds at bridge and doing yoga. Apart from their amount, the checks look identical to the $400 checks she receives every six months on her small remaining holdings of Treasury bonds. Yet Uncle Sam\u2019s obligation to send her the $400 checks is recorded on its books, whereas his obligation to send her the $1,600 checks is not. (I\u2019m 63, but not collecting benefits yet.) True, Social Security benefits could be cut by Congress and the president. But so can official debt, as Argentina\u2019s likely default reminds us. The prospect of formal default by the United States is remote. Informal default via the inflationary, easy-money policies of the Federal Reserve since 2007, is more likely. (Social Security is pegged to inflation, so while inflation would help with our official debts to creditors, like China, it is far from a panacea.) The fiscal gap \u2014 the difference between our government\u2019s projected financial obligations and the present value of all projected future tax and other receipts \u2014 is, effectively, our nation\u2019s credit card bill. Eliminating it, would require an immediate, permanent 59 percent increase in federal tax revenue. An immediate, permanent 38 percent cut in federal spending would also suffice. The longer we wait, the worse the pain. If, for example, we do nothing for 20 years, the requisite federal tax increase would be 70 percent, or the requisite spending cut, 43 percent.Even if we do nothing \u2014 which, given Washington, is the likeliest outcome these days \u2014 we should at least be transparent about our insolvency. A bill introduced last year by the Democratic senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Chris Coons of Delaware and the Republican senators Rob Portman of Ohio and John Thune of South Dakota would require the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office and the Office of Management and Budget to conduct such \u201cgenerational accounting.\u201d What we confront is not just an economics problem. It\u2019s a moral issue. Will we continue to hide most of the bills we are bequeathing our children? Or will we, at long last, systematically measure all the bills and set about reducing them?

{"Headline": "Russia Steps Up Help for Rebels in Ukraine War", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Rather than backing down after last week\u2019s downing of a civilian passenger jet, Russia appears to be intervening more aggressively in the war in eastern Ukraine in what American and Ukrainian officials call a dangerous escalation that will almost certainly force more robust retaliation from the United States and Europe.Russia has increased its direct involvement in fighting between the Ukrainian military and separatist insurgents, moving more of its own troops to the border and preparing to arm the rebels with ever more potent weapons, including high-powered Tornado rocket launchers, American and Ukrainian officials said on Friday.The officials, citing satellite images and other military intelligence, said that Russia had positioned heavy weapons, including tanks and other combat vehicles, at several points along the border where there has been intense fighting. On Thursday, Russia unleashed artillery attacks on eastern Ukraine from Russian territory, officials in Washington and Kiev said. While Russia flatly denied accelerating its intervention on Friday, American and Ukrainian officials said Moscow appeared anxious to stem gains by government forces that have succeeded in retaking some rebel-held territory.The reported Russian moves raised the prospect of a new and more perilous chapter opening in a conflict that has already inflamed the region and, with the destruction of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 with 298 aboard, stunned the world. American officials blamed a Russian-provided surface-to-air missile for the explosion and hoped the shock of the episode would prompt the Kremlin to rethink its approach, but they are increasingly convinced it has not.Obama administration officials said Russia\u2019s rising involvement had stiffened the resolve of European leaders who have been reluctant to confront Moscow for fear of damaging their own economies. But there was no appetite for a direct military response, and it remained unclear whether the West could or would take action that may change the calculus of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as Moscow seems to devote more firepower to the fight.American and Ukrainian officials said Russia has moved beyond simply helping separatists and is now engaging directly in the war. Multiple Ukrainian military planes have been brought down in recent days by missiles fired from Russian territory, and now artillery batteries are firing from across the border into Ukraine, the officials said.\u201cWe have detected that firing and that does represent an escalation in this conflict,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cIt only underscores the concerns that the United States and the international community has about Russian behavior and the need for the Putin regime to change their strategy.\u201dAmerican officials said Russia has moved 15,000 troops near the border. Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that Russia had made \u201cimminent\u201d plans to deliver heavier rockets to the separatists. Instead of Mr. Putin de-escalating the conflict after the Malaysia Airlines tragedy, \u201che\u2019s actually taken a decision to escalate,\u201d Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a security forum in Aspen, Colo.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine to express solidarity and pledge to coordinate with allies \u201cabout imposing further costs on Russia for its deeply destabilizing and irresponsible actions in Ukraine,\u201d the White House said in a statement.While the United States has been hesitant to make its intelligence public, Ukrainian officials have provided a daily, running list of Russian incursions, including flights into Ukrainian airspace by fighter jets and unmanned surveillance drones, as well as mortar and rocket attacks.\u201cWe have facts of shelling of Ukrainian positions from the territory of Russian Federation,\u201d Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, said at a briefing in Kiev on Friday. \u201cWe have facts on the violation of air border between Ukraine and Russia.\u201dMr. Lysenko said there were active-duty Russian soldiers who had surrendered, as well as volunteer Russian fighters who had been captured. \u201cWe have information about weapons and mercenaries who have respective skills for warfare, who have been passing over from the territory of the Russian Federation,\u201d Mr. Lysenko said.Russia pointedly denied the American allegations on Friday. In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused the United States of engaging in a \u201csmear campaign.\u201d\u201cAll of this is accompanied by references to some \u2018evidence\u2019 allegedly available to the United States,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cNot one of these \u2018evidences,\u2019 however, has been shown, which is not surprising. Facts and specifics to support false allegations simply do not exist.\u201dOn Friday, the European Union took another step toward imposing additional economic penalties focused on the financial, energy and military sectors of the Russian economy, but a letter to European leaders from Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, made clear that officials were still struggling to find a balance.Mr. Lysenko, the military spokesman, said that Ukrainian troops were coming under increased fire from the Russian side of the border, and that the Ukrainian military had recently shot down three Russian surveillance drones. One was used to target a Ukrainian base near the town of Amvrosiivka, which then quickly came under heavy rocket attack, he said.Ukrainian officials say their forces have recaptured at least 10 towns, shrinking the amount of territory under rebel control in the embattled regions of Luhansk and Donetsk and gaining substantial advantage, including over some of the main highways in the region.The recent gains by Ukrainian forces included the recapture of the city of Lysychansk after days of fighting. The city of more than 100,000 had been a rebel stronghold, and it posed a strategic obstacle to government troops pressing through the Luhansk region from the north and west. Ukrainian ground troops needed air support to expel the rebels, but were able to push them south and out of the city.Officials have said they believed that they could defeat the rebels within three weeks if there were no further intervention by Russia.By placing forces close to the border, the Russians can provide fire support to the separatists, prevent Ukrainian troops from establishing control over the border and facilitate the delivery of Russian arms to the separatists. The Ukrainian military has expressed frustration that at least two sections of the border remain porous. One goal of the Russian attacks on targets, an American official said, is to keep Ukrainian forces away from the border, making it easier for Russia to transport weapons and cooperate with the insurgents.\u201cThe quantity and sophistication of weaponry being sent by Russia across the border is increasing,\u201d one Western official said on Friday, adding that Russian artillery units have been firing into Ukraine from Russian territory \u201cin direct support of separatists.\u201d Like other officials with access to classified intelligence assessments, he spoke on the condition of anonymity.An article on Saturday about increased Russian involvement in the rebellion of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, even after the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, referred incorrectly to Ukrainian accounts of Russian interventions. Ukrainian officials said Russian fighter jets and drones had flown into Ukrainian \u2014 not Russian \u2014 air space.David M. Herszenhorn reported from Kiev, and Peter Baker from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Michael R. Gordon from Cairo, James Kanter from Brussels, and Oksana Lyachynska from Kiev.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reno Rolls the Dice on High-Tech", "Date": "2014-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 PhotosRENO, Nev. \u2014 A street newly nicknamed Startup Row intersects this city\u2019s old strip of casinos touting Money Maker Jackpots and Crazy Cash Slot Tournaments. While old-fashioned slot machines are whirring nearby, this stretch of road has become a home for smartphone app makers, cloud computing developers and companies like one that set up shop here recently to build tiny sensors that allow devices to connect to the Internet.For most of America, Reno stirs images of worn-out casinos, strip clubs and quick divorces. But it is trying to change that reputation and reduce its reliance on gambling by taking advantage of its location and low taxes to gain a solid footing in the new economy. Instead of poker payouts, Reno now boasts of e-commerce ventures, an Apple data center and a testing ground for drones. It also hopes to attract a large factory to build batteries for Tesla\u2019s electric vehicles.\u201cPeople believe in this town, and they\u2019re tired of being presented as this joke,\u201d said Abbi Whitaker, a local business owner who helped create a marketing campaign to reshape Reno\u2019s image. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at rock bottom there\u2019s a good chance to reinvent how you go up.\u201dReno exemplifies how cities not far from California, including Boise, Idaho, and Tucson, are trying to poach the state\u2019s technology culture to help diversify their economies, marketing themselves as places where taxes are lower and environmental regulations are less onerous. They hope that when the next recession strikes, they will not sink to the same depths as they did in the last one.Reno is among the best situated, less than a four-hour drive from San Francisco and in a state with no corporate or inventory taxes. It gained appeal as an outpost of Silicon Valley nearly a decade ago after a Microsoft licensing unit and an Amazon distribution warehouse moved in. California refugees were buying homes, lured by the relatively low cost of living and the 30-minute drive to Lake Tahoe.Then came the Great Recession, walloping Reno\u2019s gambling industry, and its housing and job markets. At the end of the recession in 2009, homes had lost nearly half the value they had in the beginning of 2006, and median prices continued to fall. At its depths in September 2010, Reno\u2019s unemployment rate was 13.4 percent compared with the national average, 9.5 percent, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics.But now, after several years scraping along the bottom in almost every measure of economic health, Reno appears poised to turn the corner, according to economists who study the region. Housing prices are slowly starting to rise. The unemployment rate has declined to 7.1 percent. New technology companies are arriving, and older ones are expanding, including Zulily, an e-commerce company for women and children\u2019s clothing and home d\u00e9cor, which announced plans in May to double its warehouse and hire 600 people.Most of all, civic boosters are on edge waiting for Tesla, Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle company, to announce the location of its new battery factory that is expected to employ more than 6,000 people. Tesla has said it is considering Nevada, Texas, California, Arizona and New Mexico. Reno is not far from one of the few lithium deposits in the country, it is relatively close to Fremont, Calif., where the vehicles will be assembled, and its industrial park has tens of thousands of acres of land for the auto company\u2019s new expansive factory. Tesla officials did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cThere are solid reasons to be optimistic about Reno,\u201d said Greg Bird, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to really see the data turn for them.\u201dReno competes for new businesses with Salt Lake City and major cities in Arizona, all of which are convenient for online retailers to set up shipping locations for customers in California and the rest of the West. In Tucson, Duralar Technologies, a global nanotechnology company, announced in March that it planned to set up its United States headquarters there.Boise has increased its marketing to lure new technology companies and has drawn several start-ups in recent years, said Clark Krause, executive director of the Boise Valley Economic Partnership. The organization emphasizes its outdoor lifestyle on its website. It is not a simple climb back from the depths of the recession for these cities. Nearly all are constrained by a shortage of skilled workers to fill the jobs created by companies their economic development offices are trying to attract.\u201cWe have the same challenges everyone else does when it comes to finding enough talent to grow as much as we could,\u201d Mr. Krause said.In Reno, where many workers traditionally have been employed in some aspect of the gambling industry, the work force is less educated than in more populous cities, economists said. Tesla, for instance, might have to recruit from elsewhere to find enough trained workers for its battery plant, should it decide to build here.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to wait for the gaming industry to come back,\u201d said Mike Kazmierski, president of the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to. So what are our strengths, and how do we capitalize on them?\u201dMr. Kazmierski is encouraging Reno to prepare for the new kinds of companies his team is wooing. A major part of his strategy is just up the hill from Reno\u2019s casino strip: the University of Nevada, Reno. The campus of 18,000 students has traditionally not played a major role in the city\u2019s economy and is physically separated from the rest of town by Interstate 80. Students often earn their degrees and leave.But now, the university is starting to work with Mr. Kazmierski\u2019s team to make sure students are trained in specific skills or even the languages needed by companies looking to settle in Reno. The university created an on-campus office space this spring for an Australian drone company that decided to open a research outlet in Reno, one of a handful of locations the federal government has selected for testing unoccupied aerial vehicles.Separately, the university just announced plans to take over an empty downtown building that will house a center for drone research, a student welcome center and a coffee shop. Mr. Kazmierski outlined his vision on a recent morning driving down Reno\u2019s casino strip, past the Showboat Inn, the pay-by-the-week motels and signs advertising $5.99 prime rib and fries. Towering old casino buildings could be turned into student dormitories or condos. Storefronts could house technology companies. The new drone research building could host an incubator space for businesses.For companies, the region\u2019s chief draw is its lack of taxes. But the location has other advantages. Reno is less than a two-day drive to anywhere in the West, an advantage for shipping companies.And there is no shortage of land ready for development. Outside town, along miles of scrubby desert, large manufacturing centers, distribution centers and office parks already have moved in, and more are on the way. The area is so expansive that wild horses roam among the warehouses. Surveyor stakes mark new developments, and fire hydrants sprout seemingly in the middle of nowhere.Three years ago Reno and the neighboring town Sparks averaged four tours a month for prospective companies. Mr. Kazmierski said that had increased to 10, with scouts from 14 companies visiting in May.\u201cThe most challenging obstacle to get over is our image,\u201d he said. \u201cThat image of a second-tier kind of Vegas is embedded in their heads.\u201dVisiting executives are surprised to learn that the Truckee River cuts through downtown, where a restaurant scene is emerging. Bike paths wind through the city and beyond, and urban gardeners raise chickens in their backyards. A new downtown boutique hotel has no casino. Instead, its main feature is its 164-foot climbing wall.The Reno Collective, along Startup Row, offers a shared work space to foster entrepreneurialism. On a recent day the office was filled by young people tapping on laptops, some sitting on exercise balls, and one with a dog curled around her feet.In the same building, Eric Jennings set up his company, Pinoccio, two years ago, making tiny radio sensors for enabling Internet connectivity.\u201cThere\u2019s such a low barrier to entry here,\u201d Mr. Jennings said. \u201cIf you\u2019re passionate about something you can just take it on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The White House has repeatedly sought to make the case that the long-term cost of not cutting carbon emissions \u2014 including longer droughts, worse floods and bigger wildfires that will damage homes, businesses and the nation\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 will be higher than the short-term expense of carrying out the regulation.The report concludes that climate-change costs will increase 40 percent for each decade that nations do not curb carbon emissions.Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party group backed by Koch Industries, the Kansas conglomerate run by Charles G. and David H. Koch, is planning demonstrations outside the hearings to protest the regulation aimed at coal-fired power plants.\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s E.P.A. is waging a war on traditional affordable energy through burdensome regulations and unrealistic mandates,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Tim Phillips, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the American people to stand up to this federal overreach, and send a message that they cannot afford to pay for Obama\u2019s environmental ideology.\u201dThe Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, a state that is heavily dependent on coal, is expected to speak at the public hearing in Washington about losses of coal-mining jobs under the proposal. The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which lobbies for the coal industry, said it would show videos criticizing the plan outside each hearing site.The Environmental Defense Fund, which is in favor of the rule, is planning rallies that are intended to focus on the dangers of climate change.Congressional Democrats are working on their own messages. The Senate Budget Committee, led by Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, conducted a hearing on Tuesday to show the effect of climate change on the federal budget. Over the past decade, federal spending during droughts, floods and wildfires has reached record levels.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer that if you care about the deficit, you need to care about climate change,\u201d Ms. Murray said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a responsibility to leave a stronger country for our children and grandchildren, and that means addressing climate change to help the environment, help the economy and help the federal budget.\u201dDemocrats hope that argument will win over some fiscally conservative Republicans. Most Republicans have said that the E.P.A. climate-change rules exemplify what they call the Obama administration\u2019s overreach.At a hearing last week, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, told the E.P.A. administrator, Gina McCarthy: \u201cYou don\u2019t run the country.

Procter & Gamble announced a write-down of $275 million on its Venezuela business. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines are slashing their Venezuela flights.Venezuela, once an apparent profit center for multinational companies, increasingly looks like a financial black hole.Despite the nation\u2019s socialist-minded government, large American and other foreign companies thrived here for years, benefiting from limited competition, brand-hungry consumers and close commercial ties with the United States. At the same time, Venezuela\u2019s overvalued currency greatly inflated the dollar value of sales on companies\u2019 books, lifting their bottom lines, at least on paper.Now the country\u2019s economic chaos is taking its toll, as currency restrictions and a major devaluation cause profits to evaporate.\u201cIt used to be a very profitable environment for them, but I think we\u2019re hitting the wall,\u201d said Carlos Tejera, the general manager of the Venezuela American Chamber of Commerce. \u201cAll indications are these multinationals are going to have to take a really cold, hard look at what\u2019s going on here and have to make a decision, because this is unsustainable.\u201dThe problems are rooted in the country\u2019s currency, the bol\u00edvar.Under standard accounting practices, American companies have long booked sales and profit on their Venezuelan operations using the primary exchange rate set by the government. For years, the currency has been overvalued, allowing multinational companies to post strong numbers.The country\u2019s high inflation \u2014 currently around 60 percent a year \u2014 has also meant that the prices in bol\u00edvares that companies charge for many goods and services have risen sharply. That has pushed up bol\u00edvar sales figures even higher and exacerbated the distortion when they are converted to dollars.Such distortions can be seen in the financials of Femsa, the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America. Last year, the company reported revenue in Venezuela of $2.4 billion, slightly greater than in Brazil, a much larger country. Yet sales volumes, which reflect the number of bottles or other units sold, were two to three times bigger in Brazil than in Venezuela, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201cIt\u2019s all smoke and mirrors,\u201d said Jonathan M. Rosenthal, co-founder of Newfoundland Capital Management, a hedge fund based in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, that holds short positions in Brink\u2019s, betting that its stock will fall as the impact of Venezuela\u2019s crisis on its business becomes clear. He said such accounting has filled the books of many companies with \u201cphantom profits.\u201dNow companies are feeling the pain from a series of currency devaluations over the last year and a half.First, the government changed the fixed exchange rate to 6.3 bol\u00edvares to the dollar, from 4.3. Then it created a three-tier exchange rate. The primary rate of 6.3 bol\u00edvares is largely intended for importing essential goods like food and medicine. Then there\u2019s an intermediate rate of 10.5 bol\u00edvares to the dollar, available to companies invited to take part in government auctions, and another, created earlier this year, of 50 bol\u00edvares, which was intended to be open to all companies and individuals, although access has been fairly restricted. Both of those rates fluctuate slightly.In the case of Brink\u2019s, the company\u2019s filings showed that Venezuelan revenues last year, measured at the government\u2019s fixed exchange rate, were a robust $447 million. The company said that Venezuela made up a \u201csignificant component\u201d of its overall operating profit last year.But the rosy outlook changed in late March, when Brink\u2019s started calculating its sales using the recently created exchange rate of about 50 bol\u00edvares to the dollar. In its quarterly report in April, the company said, \u201cWe do not expect Brink\u2019s Venezuela to be a significant component of Brink\u2019s consolidated revenue or operating profit in the last nine months of 2014.\u201dIf the devalued exchange rate had been applied to last year\u2019s Venezuela revenues, the company said, they would have shrunk by 88 percent and the operating profit for the entire company would have fallen by 31 percent.Further complicating the picture, the Venezuelan government has not allowed companies to repatriate profits for the last five years.Companies have ways of chipping away at the locked-up profits, including charging higher fees to Venezuelan subsidiaries for goods and services provided by the parent corporation. But many foreign companies are stuck holding vast troves of bol\u00edvares that shrink in value each time there is a devaluation.Procter & Gamble said in April that it had the equivalent of about $900 million in cash in this country and that it was taking a $275 million write-down as a result of applying the government\u2019s intermediate exchange rate to its Venezuelan balance sheet. Colgate-Palmolive wrote down $174 million, while Ford wrote down about $316 million.\u201cAll the companies knew there would be a loss because everyone knew there wouldn\u2019t be dollars\u201d available at the fixed exchange rate, said an executive with an American company in Venezuela who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe were trapped because the law here did not give you a way out.\u201dThe currency controls have only tightened over the last year, making it increasingly difficult for companies to obtain the dollars they need to import goods, services, parts or other materials. The government has also failed to pay companies the hard currency it had promised them for imports bought on credit from suppliers, and in many cases suppliers are now refusing to ship more goods to Venezuela until they receive payment.While international reserves have fallen, economists disagree on whether the government has enough dollars on hand to meet the demand for hard currency or whether it has restricted the supply of dollars as a matter of policy. Either way, the result is that economic production has slowed and shortages of all types are widespread.Stores are often out of basic products such as dish soap or corn flour. DirecTV has stopped taking on new customers because it cannot get the dollars to import more dish antennas.Without dollars, car companies cannot import the parts needed to assemble vehicles; Ford and Toyota were forced to temporarily close their factories. An industry trade group reported that in the first five months of this year automakers in Venezuela, including Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Mitsubishi, produced just 4,635 vehicles, down from 31,153 in the same period last year.In yet another reflection of the currency restrictions, the government has refused to let airlines operating in Venezuela trade the bol\u00edvares they receive for ticket sales and other services here for dollars. The International Air Transport Association says that the airlines have more than $4 billion in revenues held up in the country, based on the government\u2019s base exchange rate at the time the tickets were sold.The result is that Venezuela is becoming increasingly cut off from the world.Two airlines, Air Canada and Alitalia, have stopped flying to Venezuela (Air Canada said it had acted in response to violence around antigovernment protests), and others have sharply reduced service. American Airlines this month reduced its flights to Venezuela to 10 a week, down from 48. It eliminated direct flights from New York, Dallas-Fort Worth and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and flies only from Miami. American Airlines says that it is owed $750 million by the country\u2019s government. Delta, which flies from Atlanta to Caracas, said that in August it would cut flights to just one a week, down from once daily.There are suggestions, however, that the government may be edging toward reforms that could help spur the economy. Economic officials have said that they intend to move toward a unified exchange rate. And recently Jorge Giordani, an ideological hard-liner on economic policy, was pushed out of the government.After that, the intermediate exchange rate weakened slightly, a sign, for some, that changes were coming, however slowly.An article on Wednesday about the effects of currency devaluation in Venezuela misstated an equity position held by Newfoundland Capital Management, a Brazilian hedge fund. While the hedge fund holds a short position in Brink\u2019s stock, it does not hold a short position in Femsa stock. The article also misspelled the city in which Newfoundland Capital is based. It is S\u00e1o Paulo, Brazil, not S\u00e1o Paolo.Advertisement"}

ReportAt first blush, you might think that G.D.P. growth at an annual rate of 4.0 percent points to a brighter future. But in fact, these estimates are statistically noisy, and there\u2019s no guarantee that strong growth today will translate into good outcomes tomorrow. Indeed, the historical relationship between the two is surprisingly weak.The problem is that there are some line items in the G.D.P. report that tend to be very noisy, obscuring the underlying signal. In particular, there\u2019s very little signal in inventory investment, net exports or government spending.Current strength in any of these items rarely points to future strength, and may even be reversed. These three components account for only 16 percent of total spending, but because of their wild fluctuations, they exert a much larger effect on quarterly movements in G.D.P.So here\u2019s a simple trick that economists use to try to extract the underlying truth. We focus on real private final purchases, which is just the sum of the remaining 84 percent of G.D.P.: consumption and business fixed investment. This measure yields a much more reliable indicator about future growth.All told, these more meaningful data suggest that the economy is not in the middle of some whiplash, but rather that the past few quarters continue the pattern seen throughout the entire recovery, of persistent growth, albeit at a disappointing rate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "If Marriage Moves Beyond Our Means", "Date": "2014-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff The ShelfTwo professors of family law, June Carbone and Naomi Cahn, have written a crisp and cogent account \u2014 rich with detail and utterly free of legalese \u2014 of America\u2019s failure to invest in its children. On the top rungs of American life, the upper 30 percent, marriage still serves as well as ever, if not better, the authors note. \u201cThe elite do not lead the way out of marriage,\u201d they write. \u201cThey are too busy buying back into it.\u201dThe pill long ago took fear out of premarital sex, and this best serves the college-educated by permitting a couple to delay having children while both parties mature and pursue lucrative careers, the book says. When two professionals eventually tie the knot, they cement an advantage for themselves and their children.As things now stand, the authors say, only the upper tiers of Americans have the money and time to reasonably hope that their offspring will succeed. The situation is the most dire at the bottom of the economic ladder, where marriage \u201chas all but disappeared in the poorest communities\u201d \u2014 though not from a lack of respect for it, the authors say. Both men and women see marriage as highly desirable, but a goal far beyond their means, like a second home at the beach. The future of marriage in America will be decided in the broad middle class, where it is already in doubt, the authors contend. Divorce is more common than it is among the elite, but women stick with men, in or out of marriage, much longer than they do on the lower rungs. Still, marriage for the middle is teetering toward a point where it, too, may dry up and leave weddings as another rite reserved for the elite.The realities eroding marriage are no secret. Recent decades have brought far better career opportunities for women, except among the very poorest. Most women do not need to endure an abysmal marriage because they see no way to earn a living. And, not surprisingly, a working-class woman with a decent job won\u2019t commit to a man who can\u2019t find or keep a job or, worse, might end up in prison.The villain in this tale of family destruction is well known: the drying up of good blue-collar jobs, particularly for men, followed by the hollowing out of \u201cmiddle management,\u201d which had sustained millions of middle-class families. Half a century ago, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an assistant secretary of labor, saw that a lack of work for unskilled men made it hard for black fathers in particular to put bread on the table. So, as he argued in his 1965 report, \u201cThe Negro Family,\u201d black families became matriarchies, an unhealthy pattern that he said was left over from slavery. His explanations \u2014 though not his factual findings \u2014 were denounced as racist and anti-feminist. Professors Carbone and Cahn applaud the prescience of Moynihan, who later became a United States senator from New York. African-American families, they write, proved to be \u201cthe canaries in the mine,\u201d the early victims of a misfortune that has now spread much more widely.The erosion of marriage shows no sign of abating and admits of no easy solution. Certainly, the authors declare, no family policy has the power of an economy that generates good jobs for everyone. (If only!) They include a chapter on new social policies for rebuilding the family, but their recipe for reversing inequality is not much different from standard liberal recipes \u2014 or any more likely to be enacted. So they turn to family law for solutions, but the law has lagged far behind the diverse shapes that American families now assume. The authors contend that the law of marriage \u2014 and divorce \u2014 serves only the elite, the only couples with enough property to fight over.On the lowest rungs of society, family law is punitive, typically a fruitless effort to determine the paternity of hapless men who have no money to pay child support. In the middle brackets, neither parent sees much to gain by going to court. Their savings are scant; women fear being stuck with supporting a former husband who has lost his job. Unmarried parents work things out on the mother\u2019s terms, trading access to children for child support.Thus, family law today requires a rethinking so it can promote the best interests of millions of children born to single mothers, the authors say. They also hope that the new need to apply family law to same-sex marriages may show the path to better solutions for everyone.In today\u2019s economy, marriage is on the ropes. The authors accept that reality, unwelcome though it may be. They urge us to worry less about whether the parents have been to the altar and more about \u201cthe children whose lives are being shortchanged by growing societal inequity.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investment in Angolan Banking May Prove a Crippling Deal for Portugal", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLISBON \u2014 For Portugal, the oil-producing Angola provided a lifeline during a euro debt crisis that weakened its economy so much that the country had to negotiate an international bailout in 2011.For the troubled Portuguese financial institution Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, however, Angola has turned out to be a crippling investment, one that could require the government in Lisbon to do damage control with the government in Luanda.Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo allowed its subsidiary in Angola, which is a former Portuguese colony, to hand out at least 5.7 billion euros, or about $7.7 billion, in loans. That amount is equivalent to 220 percent of the subsidiary\u2019s deposits, whereas banks generally lend less than 100 percent of deposits. The Portuguese parent appears to be in no position to retrieve those loans without the support of the Angolan state.But for Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo and the Esp\u00edrito Santo family that owns it, another \u201cbig question mark is Angola, because it\u2019s really not clear what went wrong there,\u201d said Rui B\u00e1rbara, an asset manager at Banco Carregosa, a private Portuguese bank.Analysts expect Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo to report a first-half loss on Wednesday that could significantly erode or even wipe out its capital cushion of \u20ac2.1 billion, which would then require the bank to find more funds. The bank\u2019s shares fell about 8 percent on Tuesday after the publication Expresso said the bank would report a loss of about \u20ac3 billion, which would be the largest loss reported by any Portuguese bank.After the Expresso report, Portugal\u2019s central bank issued a statement saying it was confident that private investors, rather than public money, could be used to cover any capital shortfall.Just how deep a wound the Angola subsidiary, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo Angola, or BESA, could inflict should become clearer when the bank reports its results. In December, the Angolan state provided \u20ac4.2 billion in guarantees to BESA, which is majority-owned by the Portuguese bank. The guarantees did not raise alarm bells at the time, and Angola has never explained why they were needed.This month, Jos\u00e9 de Lima Massano, governor of Angola\u2019s central bank, told lawmakers that there were unspecified problems with the Angola subsidiary\u2019s loan portfolio, but that they were not sufficient to threaten the country\u2019s financial system.Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo opened BESA in 2002, under the stewardship of \u00c1lvaro Sobrinho, an Angolan businessman. In the process, the Portuguese bank not only got a foothold in fast-growing Angola but also built up ties to the government of Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, who has been president of Angola for 35 years.Two years after BESA was founded, Geni, an investment company founded by officials with ties to the dos Santos government, took a 19 percent stake in the Angolan bank.In October 2012, however, BESA announced that Mr. Sobrinho would step down as chief executive after a decade at the helm.Mr. Sobrinho said by email that he left BESA to \u201cdevote my attention to areas I have long been passionate about, including African-led investment projects and development programs.\u201dThe case was opened in 2011, but Mr. Salgado\u2019s recent arrest could indicate that prosecutors are now also intent on re-examining the Esp\u00edrito Santo family\u2019s Angolan connections. Mr. Salgado, who was released after posting bail of \u20ac3 million, has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime.The near collapse of the Esp\u00edrito Santo group has exposed a convoluted corporate structure in which industrial assets were propped up by the family\u2019s bank. That has led some Portuguese analysts and publications to speculate that a similar situation occurred at BESA, in which the strategy might have been used to issue questionable loans to Mr. Sobrinho and others close to Mr. dos Santos.Such suspicions are politically delicate in Lisbon because Mr. Sobrinho joined an Angolan investment drive into Portugal, led by Isabel dos Santos, the president\u2019s daughter, who has indirect holdings in BPI, a Portuguese bank; NOS, a telecommunications company; and Galp, an oil company.Mr. Sobrinho\u2019s own portfolio includes stakes in Sporting Lisbon, a soccer club, as well as in Portuguese news media assets like the publications Sol and Correio da Manh\u00e3 and Jornal de Neg\u00f3cios, a business newspaper.Mr. Sobrinho said he never used BESA to finance his other investments. \u201cThe notion that I could access BESA money or act alone is absolutely untrue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only payments I received from BESA were my salaries and my bonus.\u201dMr. Sobrinho said BESA\u2019s balance sheet weakened in line with \u201ca broader trend for nonperforming loans to be on the rise in Angola.\u201d The decision by Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo to provide more credit to BESA, even after its loan book started to balloon, was \u201ca 100 percent decision taken by their board,\u201d Mr. Sobrinho said.Over all, BESA borrowed \u20ac3.2 billion from its Portuguese parent, according to BESA\u2019s accounts, which then helped to inflate its own lending.Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo did not respond to emails requesting comment on BESA. A spokeswoman for Ms. dos Santos said she had no shares in either BESA or Geni, its state-linked shareholder.Rui Ramos, a Portuguese political analyst, suggested that the problems at BESA, while still unclear, probably stemmed from Mr. Salgado, the family patriarch, losing control of the management of his Angolan subsidiary, which instead \u201cdecided to declare independence and pursue its own ambitions.\u201dStill, Mr. Ramos said he expected that both governments would ensure BESA would not damage a bilateral relationship that is \u201ccertainly the closest since 1975,\u201d when Angola declared independence.The Angolan state is now expected to take control of BESA, to safeguard a bank that has about a fifth of the country\u2019s banking assets, at a time when Angola\u2019s economy has also cooled from the double-digit growth it posted until 2009. Angola\u2019s economy grew 5 percent last year.At this stage, Mr. B\u00e1rbara, the Portuguese asset manager, suggested the best case for Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo would be to write off its equity investment in Angola, worth \u20ac680 million at the end of 2013, but somehow also recover BESA\u2019s loans.BESA closed its 2013 fiscal year with \u20ac5.7 billion of loans and \u20ac2.6 billion of deposits \u2014 a gap of more than \u20ac3 billion that, according to analysts, helps explain why the Angolan state offered \u20ac4.2 billion in guarantees in December.In a recent report, the Royal Bank of Scotland said the lending risk for Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo was twofold: It would need to write down \u20ac1.5 billion of bad loans not covered by the guarantees, or the guarantees, signed for 18 months, would not be renewed by Angola.Ant\u00f3nio Samagaio, a university lecturer in auditing and accounting who has studied BESA\u2019s accounts, noted that KPMG, the auditor used by the Esp\u00edrito Santos, cautioned about some aspects of BESA\u2019s business, including its loan provisions, when the auditor cleared the bank\u2019s 2011 accounts, and that it was somehow ignored.\u201cIt seems clear to me that the board and BESA shareholders could have attacked early the problems about loan quality,\u201d Mr. Samagaio said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Central Bank Holds Interest Rates Steady", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The European Central Bank left its monetary policy intact on Thursday, choosing to wait for the extraordinary measures it enacted a month ago to work their way through the economy before deciding whether additional action was needed to bolster growth and keep deflation at bay.\u201cThe key E.C.B. interest rates will remain at the current levels for an extended period of time,\u201d Mario Draghi, the central bank president, said at a news conference in Frankfurt, citing the continuing outlook for low inflation.The decision, announced after the central bank\u2019s Governing Council met in Frankfurt, had been widely expected after the bank unveiled initiatives last month to stimulate the economy, including imposing a negative interest rate on the deposits that lenders hold at the central bank and making more cheap loans available to banks.\u201cIt will simply take several more months before the impact of last month\u2019s decisions can adequately be assessed,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Group in Brussels, wrote in a research note.The only surprise was in Mr. Draghi\u2019s announcement that, as of January, the Governing Council would begin holding monetary policy meetings once every six weeks, instead of monthly, and that it would publish minutes of its meetings.Publication of the minutes signaled a concession to critics who had called for the bank to follow what had become a widespread practice aimed at increasing transparency in monetary policy. The United States Federal Reserve has since 2005 been publishing its minutes three weeks after each policy meeting.The change in schedule also brings the frequency of central bank meetings in line with that of the Fed, but Mr. Draghi said that was irrelevant.\u201cWe have no plans to synchronize with anyone,\u201d he said.\u200b \u201cThe Governing Council decided that a monthly frequency was just too tight. That\u2019s the reason.\u201dMr. Draghi also revealed details of the central bank\u2019s new program to spur the credit market by providing cheap, four-year loans to banks in exchange for a commitment that the funds be lent to companies, instead of, for example, used to buy government bonds or other financial assets. A bank that failed to meet that condition would have to repay the loans early.The central bank hopes that supplying the loans will help ease the stark divide between the so-called core and periphery euro zone nations; Standard & Poor\u2019s estimates that corporations in Spain currently pay about 1.5 percentage points more in interest on multiyear loans than do comparable German corporations \u2014 a punishing handicap in international competition.\u201cWe want to see the impact of this program,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThe impact is going to be substantial.\u201dWhile the central bank took no action on Thursday, Mr. Draghi said the market should not interpret that as a sign of complacency.\u201cThe E.C.B. cannot and should not act every month,\u201d he said, but added: \u201cThe governing council is unanimous in its commitment to use also unconventional measures\u201d to meet its goals.The bank on June 5 initiated a minus 0.1 percent interest rate on the deposits that banks park there, effectively charging them for sitting on cash. It also cut its main interest rate target to 0.15 percent from 0.25 percent.The moves \u201chave relieved the immediate pressure for action,\u201d Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London, wrote in a research note before the meeting. \u201cThe E.C.B. has kept the door open for more easing, but will be less fussed by monthly inflation rate releases for a while.\u201dThe central bank\u2019s inaction contrasted with that of the Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, which on Thursday cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent from 0.75 percent.The Riksbank cited its own battle with deflationary pressures for the move, noting that it had revised its 2014 forecast to show prices falling 0.1 percent, compared with an earlier forecast of a 0.2 percent increase. It also cited the strength on the foreign exchange market of the Swedish currency, the krona.The krona has remained strong as the Riksbank, concerned about high household debt in Sweden, held off longer than other central banks in bringing rates down nearer to zero.A separate report showed that new lending to the private sector had been declining for more than a year.Mr. Draghi vowed in July 2012 to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro, bringing a halt to the crisis that had driven sovereign borrowing costs to unsustainable levels in several countries and restoring calm to the euro zone.As a result of that verbal intervention, and some timely bond buying, Spain, Italy and Ireland are now paying interest on their 10-year debt that is not substantially different from that on comparable United States bonds.Despite that success, the European Central Bank has had to ease policy twice since November because of the threat of deflation. The condition of widespread falling prices has the potential to further depress growth and, most worryingly at a time when the bank is trying to prop up fragile lenders, to hobble banks and borrowers.The current \u201clowflation\u201d is only partly a monetary phenomenon: With more than 25 million people out of work, and households and businesses working to reduce debt, slack demand is also holding prices in check.Economists expect the gross domestic product of the euro zone to have grown at an annual rate of a little above 1 percent in the second quarter, accelerating from the 0.7 percent growth rate of the first three months of 2014. The data will be released on Aug. 14.The central bank has become increasingly concerned about the strength of the euro, because the strong currency weakens inflationary pressures by making imports cheaper, even as it holds down the value of corporations\u2019 overseas earnings. The euro weakened slightly after the central bank meeting, trading around $1.36, and the euro zone benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 index gained more than 1 percent. The currency\u2019s weakness might have reflected expectations that a relatively strong jobs report in the United States would keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise rates before the European Central Bank, making dollar assets more attractive than those denominated in euros.Like the other big central banks, the European bank turned to ultralow interest rates after the financial crisis to keep financial institutions above water and to hold down borrowing costs for struggling corporations. Because most governments have abandoned fiscal stimulus, the other main option for affecting output, the responsibility for keeping economies afloat has fallen to central banks and the imperfect tool of monetary policy.The central bank has so far resisted the adoption of so-called quantitative easing employed by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan. In that approach, the other central banks have been buying bonds outright on a large scale, in effect converting debt securities into cash to grease the wheels of the financial system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Factory Output Plummets in Europe, Dogging Recovery", "Date": "2014-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFactory output fell 1.1 percent in the 18 countries of the currency bloc, compared with April, said Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics agency. The decline in manufacturing was broad-based, including not only economically troubled countries like Portugal, but also Germany, the Continent\u2019s economic engine.While the eurozone has been growing since last year, unemployment remains at almost 12 percent. Some economists argue that the region is still effectively in recession. The industrial production figures on Monday add to recent evidence from surveys of business sentiment that the mild recovery is already losing steam.A separate report, by the International Monetary Fund on Monday, underscored the weakness of the eurozone recovery. \u201cThe euro area recovery is taking hold,\u201d the I.M.F. wrote. \u201cBut the recovery is neither robust nor sufficiently strong.\u201dThe problems extend to the broader European Union. Eurostat reported that industrial production in all 28 countries of the European Union fell 1.1 percent in May. The declines in May came after increases of 0.7 percent in April for both the eurozone and the European Union.\u201cMay\u2019s sharp drop in industrial production highlights the lackluster and bumpy nature of the eurozone recovery,\u201d Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to investors. He noted that industrial production remains 12 percent below the peak achieved in 2008.He said that some of the drop could be because of the timing of public holidays in May, and that output in June may have rebounded. The May 1 holiday in Europe fell on a Thursday, encouraging many to take Friday off as well, and may have suppressed economic activity.\u201cFurther negative shocks \u2014 either domestic or external \u2014 could undermine financial market sentiment, halt the recovery, and push the economy into lower inflation and even deflation,\u201d the I.M.F. said. Deflation is a broad, sustained decline in prices that eventually undercuts corporate profits and wages, and can be extremely difficult to reverse.The I.M.F. praised the European Central Bank for measures it has taken to combat a decline in bank lending. But the directors of the I.M.F. said the E.C.B. should be prepared to go further if necessary, buying large amounts of government bonds to push down borrowing costs and to increase confidence.In a separate blog post, the I.M.F.'s two top officials for Europe said that such asset purchases would be effective in raising both the supply of credit and demand for it, while helping to raise inflation from levels considered dangerously low. Contrary to some other commentators, they said they did not see a big risk that so-called quantitative easing would create asset bubbles.Production during May declined in all of the eurozone\u2019s largest economies, the data showed. It fell 1.4 percent in Germany, a center of automobile and machinery manufacturing that has largely escaped the worst of the economic crisis, while output dropped by 1.3 percent in France, by 1.2 percent in Italy, and by 0.9 percent in Spain, Eurostat said.\u201cOne could make the case that the tentative recovery in the euro area has come to an abrupt halt,\u201d analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note on Monday. \u201cIf true, the implications \u2014 for asset markets, the global economy, monetary policy, and social and economic stability in Europe \u2014 would be considerable.\u201dThe Credit Suisse analysts said that they still expected the eurozone recovery to continue as demand from elsewhere in the world increases, and because of increases in consumer demand within Europe.\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that the fundamentals of recovery have changed,\u201d they said.Advertisement"}

Reliance has been demanding that the government, a major buyer of natural gas, raise its price, but it has said that the low production levels now are the fault of geological and other factors.In the months leading up to the general elections in May, Arvind Kejriwal, the leader of a nascent party that was born out of an anticorruption movement, said that Mr. Ambani \u201cowned\u201d the two major national political parties and that he was \u201crunning the country.\u201d But it is not such charges that have diminished Mr. Ambani\u2019s image. In the Indian consciousness, the perception of Reliance is complex. Close ties between the corporation and the political class would not surprise the public. The poor hate all corporations in any case, whereas the richer layers of society tend to condone and even admire Reliance for its rumored ways (even though they are less tolerant in measuring the morality of politicians).What has diminished Mr. Ambani in the eyes of the moneyed classes is that, for once, he has failed at his work. He has not managed to get the government to raise the price of gas, even though there are reasonable economic grounds for such an increase. The new government, headed by his friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has deferred the decision on higher prices. Instead, it has maintained the previous administration\u2019s policy of imposing penalties on Reliance for declining production.The journalist Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, who co-authored the book \u201cGas Wars: Crony Capitalism and the Ambanis,\u201d told me that the natural gas controversy had \u201cadversely affected the image of Mukesh Ambani\u201d among the middle class and the business elite. \u201cFor the latter, it is less an issue of business ethics and more an issue relating to investments having gone sour.\u201dAlso, Reliance Industries is facing insider-trading charges and accusations that it won its license to provide 4G mobile telephone services by improper means.Mr. Thakurta\u2019s book, which argues that Reliance tried to influence the previous government to raise the price of natural gas by leaning on favorably inclined politicians and officials, is yet another blow to Mr. Ambani\u2019s image \u2014 not only for what it says but also for the fact that Mr. Ambani\u2019s threat of legal action against the authors if the sale of the book is not stopped has been laughed away by them. The book has been largely ignored by the mainstream Indian news media. \u201cNot too many want to antagonize India\u2019s richest man, who is also one of the country\u2019s biggest advertisers and a person who heads a corporate conglomerate that wields considerable influence on the working of India\u2019s political economy,\u201d Mr. Thakurta said.But if Mr. Ambani has managed only to prevent reviews of the book and not its sales, this represents the triumph of free speech over expensive lawyers.Advertisement"}

But he cautioned that work in important areas remained incomplete or untested.\u201cWe need always be aware that the next crisis \u2014 and there will be one \u2014 will not be identical to the last one and that we need to be vigilant in both trying to foresee it and seeking to prevent it,\u201d Mr. Fischer said in a speech at a meeting of the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass.Mr. Fischer, formerly the governor of the Bank of Israel, was confirmed by the Senate as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman last month.A prominent academic economist before becoming a policy maker in the 1990s, Mr. Fischer is widely respected for his knowledge of monetary policy. In choosing to make his debut with a speech about financial regulation, not an area of expertise for him, he highlighted its importance to the Fed since the financial crisis and to his new job as a lieutenant of the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.Mr. Fischer focused on three areas of regulation.He described stronger capital rules, which limit borrowing by banks, as the area of clearest improvement, reducing the chances of bank failures. He offered a mixed verdict, by contrast, on efforts to ensure that large banks can be safely dismantled if they fail. He suggested that complete success was probably beyond reach.Referring to the problem in his prepared remarks by the abbreviation T.B.T.F. for \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d Mr. Fischer said, \u201cWhile we must continue to work toward ending T.B.T.F. or the need for government financial intervention in crises, we should never allow ourselves the complacency to believe that we have put an end to T.B.T.F.\u201dMr. Fischer expressed even greater reservations about efforts by regulators to develop tools for limiting asset bubbles. He said that the Bank of Israel under his leadership had used such tools with limited success to restrain real estate investment and the rise of housing prices.Regulators do not have good estimates of the probable impact of individual measures, he said. Moreover, measures that target areas like the housing market are likely to be \u201cpolitically sensitive.\u201d Finally, he said, coordination among regulators is required.Mr. Fischer also endorsed a suggestion by one of his predecessors, Donald L. Kohn, that Congress should instruct the Fed to maintain financial stability, adding it to the list of the bank\u2019s explicit responsibilities along with stable inflation and maximum employment.\u201cIt may well be that adding a financial-stability mandate to the overall mandates of all financial regulatory bodies, and perhaps other changes that would give more authority to a reformed Financial Stability Oversight Council, would contribute to increasing financial and economic stability,\u201d Mr. Fischer said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukrainian President Ends Cease-Fire With Rebels", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine said early Tuesday that he had ordered a resumption of military efforts to crush a pro-Russian separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine, formally ending a cease-fire after 10 days because, he said, rebels had refused to put down their weapons and had persisted in attacking government troops. Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s order came after he and the leaders of Russia, Germany and France held a four-way conference call \u2014 their second in two days \u2014 aimed at promoting the peace process. \u201cWe will attack and liberate our land,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said in a televised statement to the nation broadcast after midnight. \u201cTermination of the cease-fire is our response to terrorists, insurgents, marauders, everyone who tortures civilians, paralyzes the economy of the region, disrupts payments of salaries, pensions, scholarships, blasts the railroad, destroys the water pipes and deprives people of normal peaceful life.\u201d European leaders on Friday issued an ultimatum to Russia, saying that they were prepared to impose additional economic sanctions if concrete steps were not taken by Monday toward ending the violence. Fighting, however, had continued unabated with additional casualties, and there was little progress toward the goals set by the Europeans. After the conference call on Monday, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, each issued statements stressing the importance of achieving a truce. \u201cThe main goal should be achieving a mutual cease-fire,\u201d Ms. Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said. The Kremlin also issued a statement, saying that President Vladimir V. Putin had specifically \u201cstressed the importance of extending the cease-fire,\u201d which Mr. Poroshenko imposed unilaterally on June 20 and which formally expired at 10 p.m. Monday.In his statement, however, Mr. Poroshenko, asserted that previous steps agreed upon by the four leaders had not been fulfilled. After the conference call, he held a meeting of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, and in his televised speech, he said he had concluded that rebel leaders had no control over the fighters and that government troops could not just defend themselves in the face of continuing attacks.\u201cPeace was, is and will be my goal,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said in the statement. \u201cWhat is changing are only the tools to achieve it.\u201d Although Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s announcement suggested a full-scale resumption of the military\u2019s campaign against the rebels, it was unclear whether his order would change much. Since the separatist insurrection began about three months ago, government forces have been unable to contain the rebellion, and there have been hundreds of casualties on each side. The Ukrainian government and its allies in the West, including the United States, have accused Russia of supplying tanks, artillery and other weapons to the rebels and of allowing Russian citizens to cross the border to join the rebel militias. Russia has denied supplying tanks, and has accused the United States intelligence services of aiding the Ukrainian government in attacking the separatists, who are often referred to as \u201cprotesters\u201d by the Kremlin. There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin to Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s announcement, but Mr. Putin has repeatedly blamed the Ukrainian government for the continuing violence in the east. In nascent peace talks last week led by the former Ukrainian president Leonid M. Kuchma, rebel leaders demanded a complete withdrawal of Ukrainian military forces as a precondition to formal peace negotiations. In his statement, Mr. Poroshenko insisted that the Ukrainian government had done its utmost to bring peace to the eastern region, known as the Donbass. He added that \u201ca unique opportunity\u201d for peace had been lost \u201cbecause of the criminal actions of the militants.\u201d The Ukrainian government said that at least 27 of its soldiers had been killed in the days since Mr. Poroshenko declared the cease-fire. At a news briefing in Washington on Monday, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the top NATO commander, said that Russia was continuing to arm Ukrainian separatists despite the truce, that the military equipment provided included antiaircraft weapons. A number of Ukrainian aircraft have been shot down by separatists in recent weeks, including a military transport plane that was downed last month, killing 49. Last week, a military helicopter was shot down, killing nine.General Breedlove said there was a \u201cvery good likelihood\u201d that Russian-supplied antiaircraft weapons had been used to shoot down the aircraft, though he added, \u201cWe haven\u2019t tied the strings directly together yet.\u201dAmong those killed in the continuing violence on Monday was a Russian television cameraman, Anatoly Klyan, who had worked for the state-controlled Channel One for 40 years.According to Channel One, Mr. Klyan, 68, and his crew were traveling on a small bus with the mothers of conscripted soldiers, and other journalists, to a Ukrainian military base north of the regional capital of Donetsk, when the bus came under small-arms fire by Ukrainian troops.Mr. Klyan was shot in the stomach. Video images of the episode showed him on the bus, continuing to film after being shot. He could then be heard saying that he was no longer strong enough to hold his camera.Channel One said that the trip had been organized by rebel fighters. Michael R. Gordon contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

Signs of a rebound appeared early. The major stock indexes edged higher in premarket trading, and strong earnings from several companies kept the market in positive territory. The Conference Board\u2019s latest index of leading indicators, meant to predict the economy\u2019s trajectory, stoked the market further. The index climbed in June for the fifth consecutive month. The market built steadily on its gains throughout the day, reversing nearly all of Thursday\u2019s losses and putting the three major indexes ahead for the week.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index added 20.10 points, or 1 percent, to 1,978.22. The Dow rose 123.37 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,100.18.

Gilead Sciences notched the biggest gain among the 500 companies in the index, rising $4.12, or 4.8 percent, to $89.19. Nvidia fell the most, shedding 86 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $18.44. The health care sector is up 10.6 percent this year. Investors largely looked through the geopolitical hot spots this week in part because company earnings have been favorable, said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \u201cDespite heightened political issues on the horizon, the path of least resistance for equities is still up,\u201d he said. Late Thursday, Google reported higher earnings and revenue, even as advertising rates continued to drop. Its stock added $24.29, or 4.2 percent, to $605.11.Honeywell International gained $1.65, or 1.7 percent, to $96.82 after reporting that its income rose sharply in the latest quarter and beat forecasts.The furniture and accessories company Knoll and the semiconductor maker Skyworks Solutions also got a lift from quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Knoll jumped $1.18, or 7 percent, to $18.15, while Skyworks rose $6.53, or 14.1 percent, to $52.87.Banks have mostly reported strong second-quarter results. Huntington Bancshares was no exception, reporting stronger earnings and net interest income. Its shares added 45 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $9.75.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Kill the Export-Import Bank", "Date": "2014-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThanks to his focused, principled leadership, the American economy grew significantly in the 1980s, a fact that the bank\u2019s recent, vociferous critics, including many from Mr. Reagan\u2019s own party, should bear in mind. As a Republican, I would prefer that the private sector carry the entire load of supporting our international competitiveness. But the world market is not a level playing field, and the bank is absolutely vital for companies involved in the global economy. Having worked closely with Mr. Reagan on trade issues, I am confident that he felt the same. And while it is true, as some critics maintain, that the bank is focused on helping very large companies, its assistance ripples through the economy to help the smaller and medium-size businesses that supply larger companies. In my home state of Tennessee, for example, the Ex-Im Bank has supported nearly $900 million in export sales since 2007, according to publicly available data from the bank; that translates into support for about 6,000 jobs. Nationally, over the last five years the bank has supported 1.2 million jobs \u2014 and many of those are the sort of well-paying, high-skilled manufacturing jobs that we should be championing. The bank is particularly important today, when tight credit allocation by banks, still cautious after the recession, has left many companies, especially small and medium-size ones, unable to find financing to sell their products abroad.These companies face tough competition from companies in other countries. Many of these foreign businesses receive credit financing from their own export-import banks, at levels unseen in the United States. In 2013 China provided $46 billion in medium- and long-term official credit support; the United States offered only $15 billion.Those foreign export-import banks aren\u2019t going away; if anything, they will grow more important as the global economy continues to integrate. That is why recent calls to end the Ex-Im Bank won\u2019t work. Should we tell American companies to stop exporting? Are we prepared for the job loss that would result from decreased support for American exports? The bank is not perfect. It could do more to increase efficiency and transparency, and to better leverage partnerships to reach even more small businesses. But as President Reagan understood, that is a reason to reform it, not end it. Opponents of the bank say that it supports just 2 percent of all exports. Still, 2 percent amounts to $37.4 billion of American products made by American workers in American plants. That translates into tens of thousands of jobs from every state in the country.Lawmakers of both parties say they want to introduce policies to create and support jobs. But before we go creating new government programs, we should look at what already works \u2014 including the Ex-Im Bank.William E. Brock III, a former Republican senator from Tennessee, served as the trade representative and secretary of labor under President Ronald Reagan. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Court Blocks Arizona Policy of Denying Driver\u2019s Licenses to Some Immigrants", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday blocked Arizona\u2019s policy of denying driver\u2019s licenses to young immigrants who have received work permits and avoided deportation under an Obama administration program.The court said it could find \u201cno legitimate state interest\u201d to justify treating those immigrants any different from other noncitizens whose work permits the state had traditionally accepted as proof of authorized presence in the United States.With its ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, delivered a stinging defeat for Gov. Jan Brewer, whose steadfast stance against illegal immigration has fueled sharp public clashes with President Obama.The ruling reverses a Federal District Court\u2019s decision denying a request to halt the state\u2019s practice made by five immigrants and several civil rights groups. They argued that the practice violates the immigrants\u2019 constitutional rights to equal protection and causes them irreparable harm, particularly because it limits their employment opportunities, given Arizona\u2019s inadequate public transportation network.In a separate opinion, one of the judges, Morgan Christen, also said that the plaintiffs had \u201cpersuasively argued\u201d that Arizona\u2019s driver\u2019s license policy creates \u201ca new type of alien status,\u201d therefore usurping the federal government\u2019s role in determining immigration policy. The Supreme Court used the same argument in 2012 to block some of the provisions in the state\u2019s contentious immigration law, signed by Ms. Brewer two years before.In a statement on Monday, Ms. Brewer, a Republican, condemned the federal deferred-deportation program as \u201clawless\u201d and the appellate court\u2019s decision \u2014 issued by a panel of three judges, all appointed by Democratic presidents \u2014 as \u201ca blow to Arizona\u2019s ability to enforce its laws.\u201d She characterized the ruling as \u201cespecially disturbing given the current influx of illegal aliens,\u201d a reference to the Central American women and children being brought to Arizona from Texas, where they have been caught in record numbers trying to cross the border.A three-judge panel said it could find \u201cno legitimate state interest\u201d to justify treating young immigrants in a federal program differently from other noncitizens whose work permits Arizona had traditionally accepted as proof of authorized presence in the United States.\u201cThe American people are tired and disgusted by what is happening through our federal government today,\u201d Ms. Brewer said, \u201cbut they can be assured Arizona will continue to fight for the rule of law.\u201dNebraska is the only other state to deny driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants in the deferred-deportation program. A judge threw out a federal lawsuit challenging the policy in February, but there is another pending in state court.Jennifer Chang Newell, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s immigrant rights project who helped argue the Arizona case, said the appellate court\u2019s order was \u201csending a message,\u201d adding that \u201cdeferred-action recipients have a right to live and work in this country, and states cannot discriminate in this way.\u201dArizona\u2019s policy was sanctioned by Ms. Brewer in an executive order signed on Aug. 15, 2012, when the federal program took effect. Ms. Brewer said the federal action was \u201csimply a choice by the executive branch not to enforce deportation proceedings as required under existing federal statute.\u201d Arizona\u2019s policy was subsequently expanded to exclude other beneficiaries of deferred deportation, like victims of domestic violence, from getting driver\u2019s licenses.Ms. Matuz, 29, called on the governor \u201cto make the right moral and legal decision, open the doors\u201d of the Motor Vehicles Department \u201cand allow us to be fully integrated in Arizona\u2019s economy.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a federal appeals court\u2019s blocking of Arizona\u2019s policy of denying driver\u2019s licenses to young immigrants misstated the legal status of Dulce Matuz, president and co-founder of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition.

{"Headline": "Despite Anger Over Downed Jetliner, Europe Shies Away From Sanctions on Russia", "Date": "2014-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMSTERDAM \u2014 In cafes across the Netherlands, a new Cold War with Russia had already erupted.\u201cWe have to draw a line somewhere,\u201d said Meindert van der Kaaij, a silver-haired journalist, lamenting over beers those who died on Flight 17, 193 of them from the Netherlands. \u201cWe must say something.\u201dRussia, everybody agreed, was the real culprit.\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Niels Romijn, a civil servant, snapped back. \u201cWe must be realistic; there is just not much we can do.\u201dIt was a mirror image of the debate that unfolded in bland diplomatic language in Brussels, where foreign ministers of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states were under pressure to display resolve and common purpose after the downing of the Malaysia Airlines jet over eastern Ukraine. In the end, there was plenty of tough talk, yet no real punishment for Russia despite calls from Australia, Britain and the United States, which have all accused Russia of supplying the missile that brought down Flight 17, to take a tougher line.Despite widespread anger over the plane\u2019s downing, European nations have shied away from measures that would further isolate Russia. Dependent on Russian gas and oil, wary of confrontation on the Continent and alive to the fact of Russia\u2019s proximity, Europe\u2019s leaders have largely decided that they will have to live with a newly assertive Russia.\u201cAlmost every European state has voluntarily handed over power to Mr. Putin, allowing him to play countries against each other,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, an influential member of the European Parliament, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. \u201cWe should choose for energy independency, for principles, human rights and rule of law. But that is not what we are doing now.\u201dAt Tuesday\u2019s meeting, the foreign ministers agreed to draw up a new, broader list of targets for sanctions, including Russian individuals and entities, said Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief.But no new additional measures were imposed, reflecting fears among some Europeans that tougher sanctions would invite reprisals by Russia against countries dependent on its energy supplies, harming the Continent\u2019s economic growth.Nowhere is the European conundrum clearer than in the Netherlands, a tiny nation of 16 million but one of the wealthiest in the European Union. For more than a decade, the Dutch have been forging closer ties with Russia, emphasizing a growing trade and economic partnership while pointedly ignoring Mr. Putin\u2019s regional ambitions.A Malaysia Airlines flight with nearly 300 people aboard crashed in eastern Ukraine near the Russian border on July 17.Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, which has its head office in The Hague, is one of the largest foreign investors in Russian gas fields in Siberia. Shell is the largest corporation in the Netherlands, and its stock is widely held in the nation\u2019s pension funds. If Shell loses money, the pensions of Dutch teachers, civil servants and many others suffer.As a result, the ties between Shell and the government are extremely close, and the company\u2019s welfare inevitably influences policy, analysts said.\u201cThey have direct access to everybody in the establishment,\u201d said Sweder van Wijnbergen, who was the secretary general of the Ministry of Economic Affairs from 1997 to 2000. A former boss, Hans Wijers, then the minister in charge of the economy, sits on the Shell board of directors. \u201cNaturally, Shell will try to prevent any sanctions against Russia,\u201d Mr. van Wijnbergen said. \u201cOf course, the government ultimately makes its own decisions.\u201dA spokesman for the company declined to say whether Shell would reconsider its investments in Russia after the downing of the plane. Four Shell employees died in the crash of Flight 17.After China, the Netherlands is Russia\u2019s most important trading partner. The Russians and the Dutch have invested billions in each other\u2019s countries. In 2012, the Netherlands imported about $27.3 billion worth of gas, reselling 95 percent of it to the rest of Europe, official statistics show. Russia imported $9.7 billion in office equipment, food and flowers.The port of Rotterdam saw the import of Russian oil rise fivefold over the past decade, making the country the largest importer of Russian gas. Shell has been a major investor in a huge Russian liquefied natural gas project in Siberia.The Dutch entanglement with Russia through Shell is emblematic of ties that many European nations have with Russia.In making the case for tougher sanctions to his Parliament, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain argued that Europe should use its economic leverage against Russia.\u201cIt is time to make our power, influence and resources felt,\u201d Mr. Cameron said Monday.But other European countries have parried efforts to strengthen penalties on Russia.An updated summary of what is known and not known about the crash.France has opposed proposed sanctions against arms sales to Russia, in part because it is building two Mistral-class helicopter carriers for Russia\u2019s military.\u201cFor the time being, a level of sanctions has not been decided that would prevent this delivery,\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France said Monday. \u201cThe Russians have paid,\u201d he said, and canceling the deal would require France to reimburse Russia $1.5 billion.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Monday said that communication lines with Russia needed to stay open.Juurd Eijsvoogel, a foreign affairs columnist for one of the leading Dutch newspapers, NRC Handelsblad, said, \u201cGermany does not follow the U.S. blindly.\u201dIn Ukraine, Europe is widely seen as waffling.\u201cIt looks like they will not impose any strict sanctions,\u201d said Svitlana Khutka, an associate professor of sociology at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in Kiev.\u201cWhy? Because they say they are very concerned, deeply concerned, very, very concerned, very much concerned, so very deeply concerned,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou just don\u2019t believe that they are concerned, because it is quite evident that they have their own interests.\u201dThe Dutch have declared Wednesday, when the remains of passengers on board Flight 17 are expected to arrive in the Netherlands, a day of mourning. At the same moment, Dutch leaders are carefully trying to balance the open anger \u2014 an increasing number of people are calling the episode a war crime \u2014 with the country\u2019s deep economic ties with Russia.In full-page advertisements in major Dutch newspapers, the government offered condolences, but described the downing of the plane as a \u201cdisaster\u201d rather than a missile strike. In recent days, Prime Minister Mark Rutte has made sure to keep his lines of communication with Mr. Putin open, to \u201cbring the bodies home,\u201d he has said repeatedly.Behind the scenes, Dutch investors in Russia are also consulted, former insiders said. \u201cOf course representatives of Shell are discreetly talking to the government throughout the plane ordeal, in order to minimize damage to the company,\u201d Mr. van Wijnbergen said.Many Dutch people said they hoped for a tougher stance toward Russia from Mr. Rutte.\u201cHis real test will come after the bodies have arrived here, and after we have mourned,\u201d said Mr. van der Kaaij. \u201cI think many people in the Netherlands expect him to take a tougher stance.

Hastings Ismay, once said that the Western defense alliance was created \u201cto keep the Americans in, the Russians out and the Germans down.\u201dThe task facing the European Union now might be similarly described: to keep the British in, the Russians out and the Germans down.Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s demand to redraw Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union and put the result to a referendum in 2017 means that the next few years are bound to be dogged by haggling over the powers of Brussels and ways for London to opt out of the union\u2019s constraints.Britain has the third-largest economy in Europe, behind those of Germany and France, and is the region\u2019s financial hub. If it were to leave the bloc, the European Union\u2019s global standing would take a hit. But that\u2019s not all \u2014 Britain\u2019s pulling out of the union would also have consequences for the country itself.The confrontation last month between Britain and other European Union members over the nomination of Jean-Claude Juncker for president of the European Commission gave a taste of the kind of disputes to come if Mr. Cameron is re-elected next year.Under fierce pressure from euro-skeptics at home, the British leader risks overplaying his hand by misreading and alienating his main allies, as he did with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, over Mr. Juncker.Exasperated by 40 years of Britain\u2019s hardball tactics in blocking European efforts to adopt a more federal structure, many European leaders are tempted to cut Britain loose.Yet keeping Britain in the bloc, provided the country does not obstruct closer economic and political integration in the euro zone, remains preferable.Russia is another matter entirely. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its decision to cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine and destabilize the country\u2019s east have made it urgent for Europe to cut its dependency on Russian gas.Officials in Brussels fear Moscow may do more to economically punish Ukraine and other ex-Soviet republics like Georgia and Moldova for signing trade and cooperation pacts with the European Union.Member states differ on how far to go in sanctioning Russia, whether to give Ukraine a long-term path to membership and what incentives to offer Moscow for changing course.The Germans are reluctant to jeopardize their energy and trade interests, the French to cancel the sale of helicopter carriers and the British to endanger London\u2019s role as an offshore banking center and playground for rich Russians. While former Soviet bloc states like Poland and Estonia favor a tougher line with Moscow, others \u2014 such as Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria \u2014 are wary of putting energy supplies and business ties at risk.Preventing Russia from destabilizing the European Union\u2019s eastern flank is a common interest, but the union will continue to struggle with how and where to draw lines.Yes, but why the desire to keep the Germans down? Germany is in many ways a beacon of economic success and stable democracy, in the bosom of Europe and NATO.But its growing political clout in the European Union in the wake of the debt crisis has stirred unease in many capitals, ensuring that a tug of war with Berlin over economic and fiscal policy is likely to escalate.A lack of leadership in France, British detachment and an increasingly muscular German constitutional court have all contributed to thrusting Germany uncomfortably into the spotlight. So too have impending changes in voting rules among European Union states that give more weight to population size, and the growing power of the European Parliament, where Germans make up the largest contingent.Long underrepresented, Germans have secured an unprecedented grip on Europe\u2019s main institutions that is raising concern in London and Paris. A former aide to Ms. Merkel, Uwe Corsepius, is secretary general of the bloc\u2019s Council of Ministers; Klaus Welle is secretary general of the European Parliament; Johannes Laitenberger, chief of staff of the outgoing commission president, is to be deputy head of the legal service; Martin Selmayr is leading Mr. Juncker\u2019s transition team at the commission and is likely to be his chief of staff. In addition, Klaus Regling heads the euro zone\u2019s financial rescue fund, and Werner Hoyer, a former German minister for Europe, is chief of the European Investment Bank.The fact that these trained lawyers and economists all hold German passports does not make them pawns of Ms. Merkel. As European Union civil servants, they are loyal to a vision of a federal Europe rather than to the Federal Republic of Germany.But the dominance of German economic thinking, with its emphasis on austerity and a deep-seated culture of saving rather than spending or investing, needs to be tempered if Europe is to avoid losing a decade to stagnation and high unemployment. Just last week, the German government congratulated itself on approving the first balanced budget since 1969, at a time when many economists say Berlin should be cutting taxes to bolster domestic demand and investing more in infrastructure.The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who is trying to shake up a highly indebted country often seen as an economic and political basket case, is challenging Berlin\u2019s policy prescription, using the rotating European Union presidency to try to change the debate.His offensive, supported by France and other southern states desperate for fiscal leeway to revive growth, has drawn limited concessions from Ms. Merkel and offers Mr. Juncker a chance to make the union\u2019s economic policy mix a bit less German.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Merkel Heads to China to Keep Alive \u2018Golden Decade\u2019 of Deals", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 With some experts warning that the \u201cgolden decade\u201d of rapid growth in German-Chinese trade and dealings may be ending, Chancellor Angela Merkel embarks this weekend on her seventh visit to China, accompanied by top people from German business who, surveys indicate, are still markedly more optimistic about China than are their European counterparts.Like many people raised in Communist East Germany, where travel abroad was tightly restricted, Ms. Merkel is an avid traveler. As a trained scientist, she is also keenly interested in innovation, and in China she always travels to Beijing and at least one other province for a firsthand look at joint ventures and new Chinese research and enterprises.This trip takes her first to Chengdu, capital of western Sichuan Province, which, government officials noted, has a population almost as big as Germany\u2019s 82 million. In Chengdu, she will meet the province\u2019s leadership and visit a joint venture operated by the German automaker Volkswagen and a social center designed to help the children of migrant workers. From there, Ms. Merkel flies to Beijing, where she will be received with military honors by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and attend a dinner hosted by President Xi Jinping, but also meet film directors and address students at Tsinghua University.Both government officials and experts who discussed the trip said that human rights matters, such as any eventual request from Ms. Merkel for China to permit the artist Ai Weiwei to attend his current big show in Berlin, would be dealt with quietly, if raised at all.Ms. Merkel has been in power since 2005, making her one of the longer-serving heads of government in Europe. She and the German business community have forged strong business and political ties with China \u2014 this year alone, President Xi was in Germany in March; Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited China in mid-April and Sigmar Gabriel, the vice chancellor and economics minister, in late April. While in China on Sunday through Tuesday, Ms. Merkel will oversee the creation of a new economic committee to prepare the ground for high-level talks in Berlin in October designed to map cooperation for the next several years.Just before Ms. Merkel arrives in Chengdu, senior German and Chinese business people, academics and politicians are meeting on education and innovation. Among the Chinese attendees are Jack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group; Ge Honglin, the mayor of Chengdu; and several academics. The German team is headed by Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, a member of the board of BASF.German officials and experts discussing the trip with reporters said recent years have shown that an agenda of social reform can be pursued most effectively in such meetings, enabling China\u2019s leaders to keep matters they deem sensitive behind closed doors.Business has boomed in recent years. In 2000, government figures show, China accounted for 1.6 percent of all German exports. Last year, that had risen to 6.1 percent of all exports. Government officials, insisting they not be identified, said China is now Germany\u2019s No. 3 market, after France and the Netherlands.German businessmen are also more confident than their European counterparts that investment in China is worthwhile. Surveys from the European Chamber and in Germany suggest that many Europeans are seeking alternative markets, due to increased costs in China, competition from Chinese companies and problems with market access. The share of European businesses that wants to expand in China dropped to 57 percent this year from 86 percent a year earlier, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. German businessmen \u201care significantly more optimistic,\u201d the institute said this week, citing a 2014 business confidence survey by the foreign trade chamber.\u201cWe have had a golden decade in bilateral relations,\u201d said Sebastian Heilmann, director of the Mercator Institute. He noted, however, that \u201cmore troubled waters\u201d might lie ahead.German experts said the current anticorruption campaign in China has cut significantly into sales there of French luxury goods such as fine liquors and perfume \u2014 favorite gifts for the Chinese elite, who are now worried about the crackdown.For German businesses, experts who insisted on anonymity said that there was danger in the tightening credit in the Chinese banking system. Delays of six months in getting payment are harmful for the many medium-sized or small German enterprises, often family-run, that are the backbone of Germany\u2019s export economy and have done booming trade with China in the past 10 years.Experts also noted that Chinese companies are developing rapidly and becoming ever more competitive with German business.The government did not release a list of the business people accompanying Ms. Merkel, but her delegation traditionally includes a mix from Germany\u2019s leading Dax 30 companies and smaller companies.Among the foreign policy issues likely to be raised in Beijing is Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces continue to fight. Ms. Merkel has been most active in trying to end the bloodshed, warning of further European sanctions if it does not stop. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was in China in May and reached what was billed as a landmark deal to sell Russian gas to the Chinese. The price has not been disclosed. German officials noted, however, that it will be at least a decade before deliveries reach capacity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Presses Banks to Extend More Loans", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese government stepped up efforts to re-energize the country\u2019s economy, data showed Tuesday, pumping more money into the system last month and pressing banks to extend more loans.Chinese banks, which Beijing uses as a policy tool, reported a stronger-than-expected 1.08 trillion renminbi, or about $170 billion, of new loans in June, nearly 20 percent more than market expectations.The broad money supply, which includes cash, and checking and savings deposits, jumped 14.7 percent last month from a year earlier \u2014 the highest in 10 months, said the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China.\u201cWhile a fall in short-term lending rates hinted at a higher supply of funds during the month, the money swirling in the market reflects the urgency of the authorities to ramp up economic activity,\u201d said Chester Liaw, an economist at the Singapore consultancy Forecast.Outstanding renminbi loans grew 14 percent from a year earlier, slightly better than expectations, while the total social financing aggregate, a broad measure of liquidity in the economy, swelled to 1.97 trillion renminbi in June, from 1.4 trillion renminbi the month before.The central bank has pledged to keep credit and money supply growth at a reasonable level to meet the needs of the real economy. It aims for a 13 percent annual rise in broad money supply this year.The strong growth in money supply in June \u201cis an explicit loosening of conditions, \" said Tim Condon, an economist at ING Bank in Singapore. \u201cSome of this is seasonal. At the end of the quarter, there was demand for cash. And evidently, the authorities supplied it.\u201dBut other economists were more cautious. \u201cWe believe that June\u2019s rebound in credit growth has more to do with a weak base for comparison due to the cash crunch last year than with the current policy stance,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.Government spending surged 26.1 percent in June from a year earlier, to 1.65 trillion renminbi, further reflecting Beijing\u2019s determination to revive growth momentum. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said Tuesday that export growth should show marked improvement in the second half of the year, making it most likely that China will achieve its 7.5 percent trade growth target for the year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Proof Wall Street Is Changing, Look at Citigroup's Numbers", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBusiness ModelWell, maybe. We won\u2019t really know if too big to fail has been fixed until a major institution gets in trouble and turns up at the Treasury secretary\u2019s doorstep looking for help.Sometimes it is good to take these abstract debates about financial reform and the role of banks in our economy and look at them through the vantage point of cold, hard numbers on a balance sheet. And if you need an exemplar for a bank that is \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d the first choice would surely be Citi.Let\u2019s compare the state of Citigroup\u2019s finances in the second quarter of 2014 with the second quarter of 2007, when some early cracks in the financial system were starting to appear but big banks and the financial system as a whole still appeared solid.Our mid-2007 vintage Citigroup had $2.2 trillion in assets on its balance sheets: loans, securities and the like, which have fallen to $1.9 trillion. That\u2019s a 14 percent drop, not even accounting for inflation. Seven years ago the bank\u2019s assets were equivalent to more than 15 percent of the United States\u2019s annual G.D.P.; now that\u2019s down to around 11 percent.But there has been another, perhaps more important, shift in Citigroup\u2019s balance sheet. Back in 2007, only 37 percent of its liabilities were customer deposits \u2014 generally considered among the most stable sources of funding for a bank. Back then, most of its funding came from other sources, including $394 billion in short-term securities: \u201crepurchase agreements,\u201d also known as \u201crepo.\u201dIf that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it is the variety of volatile, short-term funding for financial institutions that was one of the causes of near-failure of major banks back in 2008. Lehman Brothers was ultimately undone, for example, because it could not continue to raise money through the repo markets.Deposits in the most recent quarter accounted for 57 percent of Citigroup\u2019s liabilities. Repo funding has fallen by more than half, to $184 billion. Another source of risk, \u201ctrading account liabilities,\u201d is also down sharply. In other words, not only is Citigroup smaller than it was seven years ago, but it also finances itself through more stable sources that are less prone to runs.What makes banks risky is their use of leverage \u2014 borrowed money. They have a thin sliver of equity that acts as the cushion against losses. What happened in the crisis was that bank losses were so great as to wipe out that sliver of equity and leave the banks at risk of shortchanging creditors and depositors.A look at the 2007 balance sheet shows just how thin that cushion was back then. Using the most basic measure, the bank had only $128 billion in equity against total assets of $2.2 trillion, or only 5.8 percent. That has risen to $211 billion, or 11 percent of the current balance sheet. There are much more complex ways of measuring capital levels that the bank must calculate to comply with international capital standards set by regulators who meet in Basel, Switzerland. They, too, show a considerably plumper equity cushion.There are plenty of arguments about what capital levels for giant banks ought to be and how they should be calculated. Anat Admati of Stanford University, for example, argues that they need to be radically higher to ensure a stable financial system. Bankers and their allies want them to be as low as possible, which would provide greater returns to bank shareholders but generate greater risk of failure. But what is beyond dispute is that Citigroup and the other megabanks are significantly better capitalized today than in the years before the crisis.As happens when any such settlements are announced, there was the usual back and forth over whether it went far enough to punish wrongdoing and whether enough of the money will end up helping victims of predatory lending. But it is a simple fact that, even for a bank the size of Citi, $7 billion is a lot of money. The settlement necessitated a $3.8 billion charge to its second-quarter earnings, which basically wiped out any profit for the quarter.Citigroup\u2019s net income was only about $4 billion in the second quarter, in line with recent quarters. Back in the second quarter of 2007, net income was $6.2 billion.But that actually understates the decline in Citigroup\u2019s profitability since before the crisis. Remember, it has more capital now than it did then. More capital plus lower earnings equals sharply lower return on that capital.Finally, there are jobs and salaries. A common critique of pre-crisis Wall Street is that it was bloated with too many workers earning too much money relative to the overall economy. At Citigroup, at least, the numbers point to that being less true today. The bank spent $8.9 billion on employee compensation and benefits in the second quarter of 2007, which was down 32 percent to $6 billion in the second quarter of this year. Citi employed 244,000 people in the latest quarter, compared with 374,000 in 2007.None of this means that Citigroup, or Wall Street more broadly, is fixed, or that a financial crisis can never happen again. But it is an important backdrop to the debate over where financial reform should go next. It just may be that the biggest risks to a stable financial system aren\u2019t lurking on the balance sheets of giant banks like Citi, but in corners of the financial world with less regulation and less scrutiny.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of Citigroup funding represented by repurchase agreements in 2007. It was $394 billion, not $394 million.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Can\u2019t the Banking Industry Solve Its Ethics Problems?", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFinancial FraudsThe financial crisis that nearly brought down the global economy was triggered in no small part by the aggressive culture and spotty ethics within the world\u2019s biggest banks. But after six years and countless efforts to reform finance, the banking scandals never seem to end.The important question that doesn\u2019t yet have a satisfying answer is why.Some of the world\u2019s leading bank regulators are trying to figure that out. And they have taken to sounding like parents who have grown increasingly exasperated at teenage children who keep wrecking the family car.This week, it was the turn of Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England. The latest British banking scandal was enough to make Mr. Carney, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker, sound like an Occupy Wall Street populist.(Pro-tip: If you are going to manipulate interest rates to squeeze an extra few million bucks out of somebody, don\u2019t make that somebody the entity that regulates you).It is telling that two of the regulators who have become most publicly angry at the banking industry for its repeated lapses are also those with the most experience with the industry. Mr. Dudley is also a former Goldman Sachs executive, and his role at the helm of the New York Fed puts him at the front lines of overseeing the biggest and most complex American banks.You know it is a sign that things are bad when people like Mark Carney and Bill Dudley think the banking industry has an ethics problem, and feel so strongly about it that they say so publicly. You might have thought that the 2008 crisis would have scared everybody in the banking industry straight \u2014 and resulted in less pushing of the ethical boundaries. But many of today\u2019s scandals involve actions that happened post-crisis; the Lloyds interest rate manipulation that Mr. Carney assailed this week took place in 2009.The fact that these scandals have all occurred since the crisis raises the uncomfortable possibility that these problems go deeper than a few executives in a few banks who push boundaries, and involve something fundamental about how the industry is organized.Ethical programs \u201cmust be linked to material incentives in order to be effective,\u201d he wrote. Any deviation from the ethics program, \u201ceven if financially lucrative, must be punishable by nonpayment or clawback of bonuses,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cSharp practice that complies with the law but causes reputational damage should be penalized.\u201dThat was published, it should be noted, in 2006, the high-water mark of bankers earning giant bonuses for packaging mortgages into securities that were highly rated but that many insiders, we now know, viewed as suspect. That said, it does suggest that the banking industry could be made more ethical if the right mix of financial penalties for misbehavior were put in place.Both a bank\u2019s financial capital and its human capital are short-term propositions, Mr. Posner wrote, meaning both investors and employees can readily jump to a better opportunity at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cAny firm that has short-term capital is under great pressure to compete ferociously, as it is in constant danger of losing its capital to fiercer, less scrupulous competitors, who can offer its investors and its key employees higher returns,\u201d he wrote.\u201cSuch a business model attracts people who have a taste for risk and attach a very high utility to money. The complexity of modern finance, the greed and gullibility of individual financial consumers, and the difficulty that so many ordinary people have in understanding credit facilitate financial fraud, and financial sharp practices that fall short of fraud, enabling financial fraudsters to skirt criminal sanctions.\u201dIn other words, the ethical breaches that Mr. Carney and other regulators assail may just have deeper roots \u2014 and thus more elusive solutions \u2014 than anyone might like to see.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Coney Island, Weaving a Confection That Tastes Like Long-Ago Summers", "Date": "2014-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Working LifeEvery New Yorker has a favorite summertime treat. As a girl, mine was cotton candy, that wondrous melt-in-your-mouth confection that vanishes when it touches your tongue. For me, it still brings to mind bumper cars and roller coaster rides, street festivals and jelly-sandaled strolls.But it had been more than 25 years since I had sampled some. So last week, I hopped on the F train to Coney Island, where the fragrance of funnel cakes and cotton candy is summer\u2019s seaside perfume. I was there to spend some time with a cotton-candy-making maestro: Jenny Villon, a 30-year-old mother of three who has been weaving the sweet stuff in this Brooklyn neighborhood for nearly a decade.\u201cThey teach me right away, the second day I\u2019m here,\u201d said Ms. Villon, who emigrated from Mexico as a teenager. She never dreamed that she would spend most of her working life making cotton candy. But life is like that, full of unexpected detours. And straightaways.To get started, you need some sugar. Cotton candy is almost 100 percent sugar, with dashes of flavoring and food coloring. The store uses about 200 pounds of it every week for cotton candy during the bustling summer months.Ms. Villon poured two scoops into a tube in the center of the Whirlwind\u2019s maw. Then she flipped a switch and the tube began to spin, heat and hum. Soon, sugary cobwebs appeared and then the familiar pink fluff.She reached in barehanded (gloves impede the process, she said), grabbed the cotton, and with a few flips of the wrist created a neat, fluffy ball, which she tucked into a plastic bag. It took 30 seconds flat.The process requires a good eye and a quick hand. A novice (like me) can end up with cotton candy flying onto the floor or with a small, limp bundle that is tasty but unappealing to the eye. (Mine ended up in my backpack, not on the shelf.)Hot, humid days can make the candy sticky and hard to bag. And when the machines get going, sometimes they spit out hot bits of rock sugar that burn your hands. Ms. Villon is matter-of-fact about that. \u201cSometimes, they get me,\u201d she said.At Williams Candy, which is owned by Peter Agrapides Jr., cotton candy has been made in much the same way for 32 years, using the same flavors, pink vanilla and blue raspberry, and the same colors, pink and blue, that I loved as a child.But there\u2019s no escaping change in this city. In the 1990s, the Agrapides family stopped attaching cotton candy to a stick. (Just putting it in a bag required less work, Mr. Agrapides said.) Since then, the staff has changed, too.In the 1980s and 1990s, most employees were African-American or Puerto Rican and many were teenagers working summer jobs, he said. Nowadays, they are mostly immigrants and many more are adults, like Ms. Villon, who have struggled to find better-paying jobs in this uncertain economy.Ms. Villon, who earns $11 an hour and works year round, grew up savoring lollipops and chewing gum in Mexico. At home, she makes chocolate-covered strawberries, never the fluffy pink stuff. \u201cI get tired of candy,\u201d she confessed.Over the years, she has grown accustomed to the sugary scent that lingers in her hair, long workdays during the summer and shorter ones in winter when the staff focuses on catering parties, bridal showers and bar mitzvahs.Ms. Villon said she sometimes dreams about finding another job, one with more regular hours and better wages, the kind she once imagined for herself when she arrived in the United States at age 15.\u201cBeing a nurse, yeah,\u201d Ms. Villon said, thinking of those faded hopes. Then she shrugged, not one to dwell on her troubles.She knows that she is part and parcel of summertime rituals, as integral as the feeling of sand between your toes and those leisurely jaunts down the boardwalk.So when a crowd of customers walked in during my visit, Ms. Villon greeted them with a smile and watched as they dived into her delectable creations.It was just as I remembered: that taste, the glorious sweetness that holds for just an instant. Then it\u2019s gone, a reminder that summer, like life in this city, is often bittersweet.Email: swarns@nytimes.comTwitter: @rachelswarnsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Francis Names New Leadership for Vatican Bank", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis continued his efforts to modernize and reorganize the Vatican finances on Wednesday, by appointing a new leadership for the scandal-tainted Vatican Bank, streamlining other operations and signaling future changes to the church\u2019s global media operations.The most prominent move, rumored for weeks, was the appointment of Jean-Baptiste de Franssu as the new president of the Vatican Bank, officially known as the Institute of Religious Works, or I.O.R. Mr. de Franssu, a Frenchman who was formerly head of European operations for the investment management company Invesco Ltd., had been serving on an economic advisory council that Francis created in March. He replaces Ernst von Freyberg, a German industrialist appointed last year.Cleaning up the Vatican\u2019s murky finances has been a top priority for Francis, especially after many of the cardinals who elected him as pope in March 2013 spoke openly about their displeasure with the Vatican\u2019s financial operations.In recent years, the Vatican Bank has been under growing pressure to comply with international practices to fight money laundering and meet other global norms. In 2010, Italian prosecutors temporarily seized $30 million from two accounts at the bank as part of a financial investigation.It was Francis\u2019s predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who appointed Mr. von Freyberg to begin cleaning up the bank. Joined by outside consultants, his team was given the task of introducing greater transparency in bank practices while also examining about 18,000 accounts at the Vatican Bank for possible illegal activity.His team published the bank\u2019s first ever annual report and instituted protocols to prevent money laundering. And more than 3,000 accounts have been closed, most due to inactivity or small balances, though nearly 400 were closed after bank officials decided to narrow eligible customers to people with direct ties to the church.\u201cToday, I.O.R. is in good shape, also financially,\u201d Mr. von Freyberg said at the news conference on Wednesday.The bank\u2019s legacy of past mismanagement was evident in an annual report released on Tuesday. It showed that profits had fallen sharply because of the declining price of gold as well as write-downs on bad loans issued before 2013. One priority has been to tighten internal bank controls to prevent powerful church officials from handing out loans with limited scrutiny.In recent weeks, European news media have reported on an unconfirmed investigation into a bank loan of 15 million euros ($20.4 million) to a Catholic filmmaker that was approved in 2012 by the Vatican\u2019s former second-in-command, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone. Such a write-down was listed in Tuesday\u2019s financial reports, though without specific mention of Cardinal Bertone.On Wednesday, Cardinal Pell praised Mr. von Freyberg\u2019s role at the Vatican Bank, noting that he had overseen the first phase of reforms while working part-time, splitting his weeks between Germany and Rome. He said the position now demanded a full-time occupant.At the same time, many analysts say, the restructuring will limit the authority of the bank and other existing Vatican financial institutions over some assets and investments while placing more power in the new Secretariat of the Economy, which was created by Francis and is now led by Cardinal Pell.\u201cFor the I.O.R., it\u2019s an epochal change,\u201d said Paolo Rodari, an expert on the Vatican at the Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica. \u201cIt will become a mere retail bank, as many cardinals during the conclave had called for. But this move allows the Vatican to keep having a bank that distributes money to all its missions all over the world.\u201dAnalysts say that Cardinal Pell, an Australian, is emerging as a major power broker in Francis\u2019s restructuring of the Vatican bureaucracy, while Italian prelates who were once dominant in economic affairs have seen their clout diminished.Cardinal Pell also announced the formation of a committee to propose changes to the Vatican\u2019s media operation, which will be led by Christopher F. Patten, the chancellor of Oxford University.The cardinal said the Vatican media division, which employs a large staff of translators and journalists, especially on radio, needed to be modernized, and he predicted future cost savings through attrition and restructuring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Must Confront Putin", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorRIGA, Latvia \u2014 The death of 298 innocent civilians on Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was the direct result of Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s reckless geopolitical gamble in Eastern Ukraine \u2014 as well as the West\u2019s weakness in countering him.After the Cold War ended, most Western leaders optimistically assumed that Russia would develop like other former Eastern Bloc nations that embraced democracy and the market economy. This attitude was bolstered by new economic opportunities in Russia, particularly in the oil and gas sectors. As a result, European and Russian economic interdependence was encouraged.When Russia invaded and annexed Crimea earlier this year, the West was by and large taken by surprise. Russia seized the territory of an independent country in violation of the core principles of the postwar global order without facing any serious consequences. It then proceeded to further undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine. Europe, and to a lesser extent America, were so deeply dependent on economic ties with Russia that they seemed unable and unwilling to meet the challenge. Mr. Putin calculated that he could get away with annexation, considering that he faced no serious consequences after the war against Georgia in 2008, when South Ossetia and Abkhazia came under Russian control and Georgian ambitions to join the European Union and NATO were curtailed. Mr. Putin applied these lessons to Ukraine. The seizure of Crimea was also made possible by the Russian media\u2019s brainwashing of viewers, and huge increases in the Russian military budget after 2008. After a smooth occupation of Crimea, with overwhelming domestic support, Mr. Putin began destabilizing Ukraine\u2019s eastern regions. Simultaneously, Russia increased its military activity in the Baltic Sea and near Finland, sending messages to its European neighbors to stay out of its sphere of influence. The Western response mainly consisted of diplomatic lip service and relatively weak sanctions that failed to change Russia\u2019s tactics or dent Mr. Putin\u2019s support at home. Without Russian intelligence, weaponry, propaganda and political and economic support, entities like the so-called Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk would never have survived more than a few weeks.By failing to stop Russia from moving men and mat\u00e9riel, including heavy weaponry, across the border the West made the tragedy of Flight 17 possible.The West must remove its rose-colored glasses and see Russia for what it is: a revanchist power ruled by a political elite whose popularity is based on aggressive anti-Western propaganda and skillful manipulation of the media. Russia views foreign policy as a zero-sum game and uses European energy dependency as a tool to achieve its aims. It is ruled by men who do not respect human life and dignity; to them, the downing of Flight 17 is merely collateral damage in wider geopolitical game.Expecting full cooperation from Russia in the crash investigation was never reasonable; that would have undermined the perception of strong Russian leadership in the eyes of those who have been fooled into believing in Russia\u2019s renaissance as a renewed world power. The death of nearly 300 innocent airplane passengers demands more than strong words. The European Union and the United States must take action; further hesitation will only make the situation worse. First, America and Europe must demand an investigation of who gave the order and who executed the strike on Flight 17. Second, Russia must immediately shut down its border with Ukraine to any movement of military equipment and international observers should be sent to monitor the border. Third, Europe and America must support reform in Ukraine. There is money available and Ukrainians could draw on the experience of countries like Poland and Baltic states to assist in their transition. Fourth, after more stringent anti-Russian sanctions are agreed upon, there must be trans-Atlantic solidarity to mitigate any Russian economic or political pressure on European member states that depend on Russian energy supplies. Fifth, Europeans must realize that their fading soft power will decrease even faster without a significant increase of their military budgets and hard-power capabilities. A first step would be a stronger and more permanent NATO presence in Poland and the Baltic states. Finally, the Russian public should be made aware that the West is the last thing they need to worry about. America and Europe pose no threat to them. It is the policies of the current Russian political elite that risk destabilizing Russia\u2019s economy and jeopardizing the prosperity of its people.The post-Cold War era of high hopes and an interdependent world has sadly come to an end. The downing of Flight 17 must be a turning point. It should serve as a reminder to Russia that the European Union and the United States are capable of enforcing their policies. Failing to do so will make them less powerful and less relevant global players.Advertisement"}

Scattered piles of weathered, gray boards dotted the steep, grassy banks like forgotten kindling. The captain held up a black-and-white 8-by-10 photo that echoed the view circa 1940. Back then, the timber stacks were clearly houses, schooners rested at anchor, and on the farthest hill stood a white church. Now, in the church\u2019s place, a steeple lay in the tall grass. Worshipers last attended a service here in 1965, before a government resettlement policy forcibly moved the 157 residents of the remote fishing village, or \u201coutport,\u201d to larger communities in order to centralize the population.\u201cIt was all about economics to take people from small communities and put them closer to the infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Miller said, his voice modulating between resignation and anger, \u201cbut you can\u2019t take a man who\u2019s lived all his life on the fishing grounds and put him in a city.\u201d The 55-year-old former cod fisherman, born in the similarly abandoned town of Kerley\u2019s Harbour, began guiding outport ghost-town tours three years ago. \u201cIt was often said, \u2018They moved, but they never arrived,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.Last June, I arrived three hours north of St. John\u2019s, the capital of Canada\u2019s easternmost province of Newfoundland and Labrador, to explore the craggy Bonavista Peninsula and its surrounding waters. The peninsula is one of Newfoundland\u2019s most dramatic appendages, a place where I\u2019d heard that entrepreneurs like Mr. Miller were building a new tourism economy to supplant fishing. Over four days, I found the area\u2019s lonely beauty a compelling backdrop to its history of frontier survival, collapse and 21st-century renewal.Resettlement was just the first blow to Newfoundland, where coastal trees often grow sideways in the wind. For nearly 500 years, the 43,000-square-mile island thrived on cod fishing. But overfishing prompted a moratorium in 1992, resulting in the unemployment of an estimated 30,000 people and the steady depopulation of coastal fishing villages. Now about half of Newfoundland\u2019s 500,000 residents live near the capital of St. John\u2019s, with about six people per square mile beyond.The leftovers \u2014 a coastal wilderness of towering sea cliffs, surf-strafed beaches and mossy forests \u2014 are a visual feast, occasionally attracting Hollywood. The 2001 movie \u201cThe Shipping News\u201d was filmed here, as was the recently released \u201cThe Grand Seduction.\u201d Twenty-two years into the post-fishing era, the roughly 70-mile-long peninsula seems to have reached a tipping point with just enough going on \u2014 good food, distinctive accommodations and interesting tours \u2014 to keep a traveler engaged, but not enough to spoil the view.\u201cSuddenly there\u2019s an understanding that people like art on the walls and a decent cup of coffee,\u201d said John Fisher, an Ontario \u00e9migr\u00e9 who came to those conclusions in 1997 when he opened Fishers\u2019 Loft, a four-room B&B in tiny Port Rexton. Today the inn\u2019s 33 rooms are spread among six buildings \u2014 brightly painted, wood-shingled saltbox cottages and sea captain\u2019s homes that are distinctive architectural styles of Newfoundland.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to showcase what Newfoundlanders have done all their lives,\u201d said Ms. Hayes, offering me a glass of homemade rhubarb lemonade. \u201cYou go away and come back with an appreciation for what we have here.\u201dThe trail is 10 minutes\u2019 walk from Fishers\u2019 Loft, where last summer John Fisher oversaw the construction of a double-entry labyrinth, in which two walkers can race to the center on circuitous but parallel paths. \u201cWe\u2019re still an emerging destination,\u201d Mr. Fisher said over coffee in the inn\u2019s art-filled living room. \u201cPeople are not hardened to tourism. They\u2019re curious, if anything. The labyrinth is a way to better connect guests to local people.\u201dLater that day, aboard the Rugged Beauty, I joined a couple from Toronto and listened to the stories about fishermen and their hard-working families that Mr. Miller tells to bring Newfoundlanders, past and present, to life. He ended the four-hour cruise at his own cabin built in the resettled outport of British Harbour, a creekside clearing of fallen sheds fronting a white-capped bay ringed in silent forests.Offering me a hand back into the boat, Mr. Miller remained incredulous at his own story. \u201cCan you imagine leaving here willingly?\u201d he asked.An article last Sunday about the Bonavista Peninsula, part of the island of Newfoundland, misstated the surname of a guide with Sea of Whales Adventures at one point. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Kris Prince, not Price. In addition, the article misstated the name of a village there, and an accompanying map labeled incorrectly the province that includes the island of Newfoundland. The village is British Harbour, not English Harbour, and it is Newfoundland and Labrador, not just Newfoundland.IF YOU GOWhere to Stay Where to Eat What to Do Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe Set to Toughen Russia Sanctions", "Date": "2014-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The United States and Europe put aside their differences and agreed Monday to sharply escalate economic sanctions against Russia amid worries that Moscow is stepping up its intervention in Ukraine and may be setting the stage for an outright invasion.After months in which European leaders resisted going as far as the Americans, the two sides settled on a package of measures that would target Russia\u2019s financial, energy and military sectors. In some cases, the Europeans may actually leapfrog beyond what the United States has done, forcing Washington to catch up.The collaboration suggested a hardening resolve among the allies after the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine this month. Not only has Moscow not backed down, as some hoped it might, but American, European and Ukrainian officials said Russia had actually accelerated its involvement in Ukraine\u2019s civil war with pro-Russian separatists.The agreement came during an unusual five-way videoconference involving President Obama and his counterparts from Britain, France, Germany and Italy in advance of a European Union meeting on Tuesday to consider new sanctions on Russia. If the Europeans announce their new measures as expected, Obama administration officials said they planned to follow with their own later in the day or on Wednesday.\u201cWe expect the European Union to take significant additional steps this week, including in key sectors of the Russian economy,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser. \u201cIn turn, and in full coordination with Europe, the United States will implement additional measures itself. Our purpose here again is not to punish Russia but to make clear that it must cease its support for the separatists and stop destabilizing Ukraine.\u201dAmerican officials said Monday that an overt Russian invasion of Ukraine, although still unlikely, appeared more possible than it did just weeks ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant re-buildup of Russian forces along the border, potentially positioning Russia for a so-called humanitarian or peacekeeping intervention in Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Blinken said.While criticized at home as not being tough enough on Russia, Mr. Obama has been pressing Europe to stand firmer against Moscow. With their economies far more dependent on energy-rich Russia, the Europeans have until now imposed mainly modest sanctions focused on individuals rather than measures intended to damage the Russian economy. On Monday, they agreed to target a handful more individuals.But the package to be finalized Tuesday would go much further, matching and in some cases exceeding the actions Mr. Obama took on his own this month in blocking access to medium- and long-term American capital markets for some of Russia\u2019s largest and most global banking and energy companies.The Europeans plan to impose similar capital-market restrictions on Russian state-owned banks as well as an embargo on future sales of arms and to restrict the sale of equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, according to officials briefed on the discussions. They are also considering limits on technology sales to Russia\u2019s oil industry.Under their own procedures, the Europeans cannot target individual Russian banks the way the Obama administration has, so the capital-market measures will affect all banks that are majority-owned by the Russian state. The Americans would then try to catch up by targeting more Russian banks. Although there would be some gaps between the two moves, officials said they would work to make sure Russia could not slip through them.American officials were heartened by the agreement, saying it would frustrate efforts by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to drive a wedge between the United States and its allies. The key to the agreement, they said, was Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who dropped her past reluctance and pressed for more assertive moves, which forced the French to go along, and that then forced the Italians to give in.The new actions come as Russia\u2019s economy is already under enormous pressure exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis, with growth effectively stifled, capital fleeing the country, the ruble stressed and foreign investors increasingly shying away. Whether that will change Mr. Putin\u2019s calculus, however, remained uncertain, and some American officials privately expressed doubt. Indeed, some worried that the escalation, along with Ukraine\u2019s military success on the ground, might push Mr. Putin into a corner in a way that made him less willing to back down.Moreover, the Europeans still refused to go as far as the Americans wanted. The arms embargo, for instance, will affect only future sales, and will not stop France from completing its delivery of Mistral-class helicopter carriers that has drawn criticism from Washington and elsewhere. Britain remained hesitant to cut off the entire Russian financial industry. And the Germans opposed measures affecting Russian natural gas, on which it relies for energy.Even so, the European willingness to escalate sanctions reflected a shift in attitude across the 28-member bloc, nowhere more so than among one of the Continent\u2019s most powerful constituencies: German industry. Several prominent German business leaders indicated in recent days that they supported tougher sanctions or were at least resigned to them, giving Ms. Merkel more political leeway.\u201cIn light of the most recent escalation, new sanctions are unavoidable,\u201d Hannes Hesse, executive director of the German Engineering Federation, which represents makers of machinery and heavy equipment, said in a statement. Mr. Hesse said the consequences for some German companies would be \u201cbitter\u201d but acknowledged that diplomatic efforts had largely failed.Germany\u2019s economic vulnerability may be broader than that of other European nations, reflecting its substantial commerce with Russia and its longstanding position as a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe. Recent surveys show that optimism among German businesses is sagging because of concern about Ukraine, and economists have begun predicting that the economy could stagnate or even shrink.Until recently, many German businesspeople argued that it was better to engage Russia than to confront Mr. Putin too overtly, and some still do. \u201cFurther sanctions raise the price that everyone has to pay for this conflict,\u201d Eckhard Cordes, a former Daimler executive and chairman of the Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, said last week.But many business leaders have taken a harder line since the Malaysian airliner went down with 298 aboard. \u201cThe behavior of the Russian government in the Ukrainian secession conflict must have noticeable consequences,\u201d Ulrich Grillo, president of the Federation of German Industries, wrote in an article published Monday in Handelsblatt, a financial newspaper.The shift parallels growing impatience by German political leaders. Christiane Wirtz, spokeswoman for Ms. Merkel, told reporters in Berlin on Monday that \u201ca completely new situation has emerged which makes further measures necessary.\u201d She added, \u201cOnly such a substantial package would enable the German government and the E.U. to send a clear, strong signal to Russia.\u201dIn Moscow, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said that while Moscow did not welcome the measures, it had no plans to respond in kind. \u201cWe do not want to act tit for tat,\u201d he said, adding that he was sure Russia could overcome any difficulties caused by sanctions. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will be even more independent and more confident in our own course.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Peter Baker from Washington.

But it\u2019s not merely an issue of the rich getting richer. The typical American household has been getting poorer, too.For households at the median level of net worth, much of the damage has occurred since the start of the last recession in 2007. Until then, net worth had been rising for the typical household, although at a slower pace than for households in higher wealth brackets. But much of the gain for many typical households came from the rising value of their homes.

{"Headline": "From Republicans, a New Approach to \u2018Accountability\u2019", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Plan on PovertyFor Republicans, the top concerns about anti-poverty programs have long been: Are they affordable, and do they discourage people from working their way out of poverty? A new plan out Thursday from Representative Paul Ryan\u2019s House Budget Committee reflects a significant change in the way Republicans talk about both concerns.This is not a plan to cut spending on the poor: As drafted, it would not increase or decrease federal spending on anti-poverty programs. States participating in the pilot would get the same amount of money as would be spent on the corresponding programs if they weren\u2019t in the pilot.And while the Republican plan would seek to improve incentives to work, those incentives would take a more refined form than simply yanking benefits away from people who do not get jobs within a certain period. States would contract out the administration of benefits to a variety of agencies (possibly including state government agencies themselves) and hold the agencies accountable for whether their beneficiaries get educated, into work, and out of poverty.The plan aims to resolve a complaint Republicans have long had about anti-poverty programs: They can create a significant disincentive to work. As people earn more income from their work, they gradually lose eligibility for programs like Medicaid, food stamps and housing assistance. This acts like a high tax rate: Over some income ranges for single parents with children, an additional dollar of labor income can mean paying 80 cents in taxes and lost benefits. People aren\u2019t inclined to work more if they barely get to keep any of their added income.There are two obvious fixes for this. One is to phase benefits out more slowly or even not at all. For example, instead of Medicaid and insurance subsidies for the middle class, we could have single-payer health care available to people at all incomes. This would remove a disincentive to work, but it would also be very expensive, so Republicans reject this approach. The other approach is to reduce the baseline level of benefits, so there is less to phase down from. Republicans have advocated this approach in the past; past Republican plans for Medicaid have revolved around drastically reducing overall spending on the program over time. But they reject that philosophy in Thursday\u2019s document, on the grounds that it \u201cwould mean deep cuts for the most vulnerable.\u201dWith those plans off the table, what\u2019s left is finding ways to push people to work even though that means a loss of benefits. Republicans have embraced a crude approach on this in the past: work requirements and time limits, so that people ultimately lose their benefits if they don\u2019t work. The problem with this method is that it holds people accountable for something they cannot always control: People can end up in deep poverty when bad luck, bad long-run circumstances or a poor economy keep them (or their parents) out of work for a long time and their benefits run out.Thursday\u2019s plan still uses those approaches in a limited form. States would be required to impose time limits on cash welfare, which is already required under the welfare reform law enacted in 1996. And they would have to require able-bodied beneficiaries to work or engage in \u201cwork-related activities,\u201d which could conceivably mean a lot of things, including job training. States and agencies could impose additional requirements on beneficiaries.But crucially, the plan introduces an additional level of accountability: The public and private agencies that administer benefits would be evaluated and rewarded based on their aggregate success of getting people educated, into work and out of welfare. The states and agencies could use their flexibility toward this goal, directing their resources to the sort of assistance they see as most likely to help beneficiaries succeed. The advantage of an aggregate goal is that it can reward more effective approaches without assuming that every single beneficiary should be employed and off welfare by a specific deadline.There\u2019s a lot to be worked out, both operationally (how do you properly measure success?) and ideologically (in what cases is it morally acceptable to withdraw benefits from an individual who is not working?). One likely pitfall is that evaluating agencies\u2019 performance will be challenging because of the diversity of the clients. One way to score well on measures like \u201cAre clients getting jobs?\u201d is to position your agency so it is likely to enroll the easiest-to-employ beneficiaries. This is a significant problem in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, where insurers try to enroll the healthiest people; risk-adjustment mechanisms to compensate for that are imperfect.A spokesman for the House Budget Committee told me agencies wouldn\u2019t get to decide who they could enroll as clients. That would reduce the risk of adverse selection, but it also discards a possible advantage that comes from using competing, private agencies in the first place. You might want different agencies to specialize in certain types of clients \u2014 for example, by developing expertise in working with the recently unemployed, single parents with young children, the old or other subgroups. The difficulty of getting these choices right is one reason to proceed with a pilot program and see how it works, rather than jumping right into a national reform.In the past, Republican efforts to reform social programs have gotten hung up on cost. When it\u2019s time to put numbers to the budget, Republicans want spending cuts that Democrats won\u2019t agree to. But if Republicans are serious about conducting these pilots within the existing budgetary parameters for spending on aid to the poor, they might engage in a conversation with Democrats and President Obama about how to make our existing anti-poverty dollars work better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Nations Bloc to Open Development Bank", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 At a meeting in Brazil, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa announced on Tuesday that they were establishing a development bank to challenge the influence of venerable institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.The New Development Bank, which will be based in Shanghai, will open with an initial capitalization of $50 billion. India will name the first president, according to a statement from the leaders of the so-called BRICS group of nations who have gathered in the northeastern city of Fortaleza, and Russia and Brazil will select other top officers.\u201cThis provides security, a kind of safety net for BRICS countries and others,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said.Taken together, the New Development Bank and the contingency fund reflect ambitions of forging a new global economic framework. While the United States has long wielded influence in the global economy through those institutions, China, which accounts for about 70 percent of the collective gross national product of the countries represented at Fortaleza, has tried to play down its staggering economic weight in the bloc. But that could change over time, analysts said, if animus grows over China\u2019s trade surpluses with other members.\u201cThere may be potential cracks in the facade of unity once China asserts its interests,\u201d said Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas and the Americas Society in the United States.The BRICS countries face other challenges like slowing economic growth.

Gallagher, a professor of international relations at Boston University, emphasizing the influence the countries already have within organizations like I.M.F. and the World Trade Organization. \u201cThey are a force regardless of their growth rate, which will remain faster when averaged than the West\u2019s for years to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fund Investors, Basking Under Many Clouds", "Date": "2014-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTOCKS rallied through the second quarter, as investors displayed a growing appetite for risk and a striking lack of concern about any reversal of fortune. Although they are still taking it mostly on faith, they remain confident that the Federal Reserve eventually will engineer a solid economic revival.\u00a0The market has\u00a0risen long enough that the second-quarter gain of 4.7 percent in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index left it trading at roughly 19.6 times earnings. That is well above the long-term average multiple of 15.5, but buyers may not mind the altitude because their road has been so remarkably straight and smooth. (The last significant market correction was almost three years ago.)Through June, the last day with a stock-market move of at least 1 percent in either direction was on April 16, making this the longest such stretch since 1995. That helps explain why indicators of investor opinion show near-record lopsidedness in ratios of bulls to bears \u2014 nearly four to one in the widely followed Investors Intelligence survey of advisory newsletters.Rich valuations and extreme bullishness may look like signs of euphoria, but other evidence suggests that investors are more bored than thrilled. Trading volumes in American stocks and some bonds, notably Treasury instruments, are close to their lowest levels in at least five years.With asset prices rising \u2014 stocks, bonds, real estate investment trusts, gold and other commodities were all up in the second quarter \u2014 and the Fed still supporting markets with unorthodox policies like keeping short-term interest rates near zero, Wall Street has few sellers. Those same policies are believed to have raised valuations substantially and artificially, however, so that there aren\u2019t many buyers, either. There is a consensus that stocks are more promising than bonds but that, with stock prices high and bond yields low, and with the Fed contemplating a return to a more normal environment, prospects for both major asset classes appear limited. So caution is warranted.In the second quarter, investors were in a sufficient hurry to put money to work that they sent fund prices higher across the board, although more modestly than in other recent periods. Domestic equity funds rose 3.9 percent, on average, according to Morningstar, while international stock funds were up by 4.6 percent and bond funds by 2 percent.THE markets may have enjoyed a placid three months, but the environment wasn\u2019t entirely cheerful. To the contrary, there were plenty of reasons for concern. Tensions remained high in Ukraine, and attacks in June by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a formidable group of insurgents tied to Al Qaeda, threatened to bring civil war to Iraq and helped to drive oil prices to their highest levels in nearly a year, though they have since fallen. And as the quarter came to a close, violence flared up between Israel and its Palestinian adversaries.The battle against economic stagnation in the United States had a setback, too. A report released in late June showed the gross domestic product contracting at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the worst result since 2009, when the recession was ending.Yet these inauspicious developments caused barely a ripple in the markets. Investors evidently decided that the foreign conflicts would have little impact in the United States, and economists and strategists took the negative economic reading as a one-time event caused by a particularly severe winter.\u201cThere was a hiccup in the first quarter, but investors are reassured that much of it was due to the weather,\u201d Mr. Koesterich said. \u201cThe economy is improving, but not enough for the Fed to feel threatened\u201d into tightening policy.He called the strife in Iraq more troubling.\u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect between the front page and the business page,\u201d Mr. Koesterich said. None of the front-page issues earlier in the year \u201chad a strong-enough link to the global economy to affect the markets, he added. \u201cIraq does. If oil goes to $125 a barrel, it could provide a headwind and be a game changer.\u201d\u201cYou have the potential for a violent situation in one of the most critical regions, and everyone\u2019s yawning,\u201d he said.Mr. Buetow also expressed concern about conditions on the home front, in the economy and the markets, but more so than some of his peers.\u201cWhere do you start?\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the organic growth? You can only squeeze so much water out of this rock. Look at the figures that folks are using to defend equity valuations. They\u2019re using unsustainable profit and growth assumptions. The market is frighteningly, dangerously overvalued.\u201dGiven that outlook and the need to put money somewhere, many of Mr. Buetow\u2019s investment preferences tend to be distant or obscure. He likes agricultural commodities and precious and industrial metals, with stocks and bonds in developed Pacific markets like Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and Australia. Those places, he said, have \u201cbetter growth prospects, far better fiscal and monetary policies and far more attractive valuations than any other markets in the world.\u201d When it comes to American stocks, the few sectors that he favors have high dividend yields, such as telecommunications, utilities and staples.Funds that specialize in utility stocks excelled in the second quarter, gaining 8.8 percent, on average, while energy sector funds had a return of 12.2 percent. Funds that focus on financial services were noticeably weaker, rising 1.3 percent. The strength in international stock funds came largely from India, with an average gain of 16.6 percent, and Latin America, up 8 percent. It was hindered by an average return of 1.4 percent for European funds. Like Mr. Buetow, Mr. Kelly favors commodities, although he made a point of excluding gold from his list of recommended holdings. He advised a \u201ccautious overweight\u201d position in domestic stocks, summarizing his outlook as \u201ca green light on stocks relative to bonds and a yellow light on absolute valuations.\u201d He would also emphasize European and emerging stock markets.Europe is also a preferred destination for Ms. Hooper at Allianz. She went so far as to call herself \u201cexcited about European stocks\u201d after the European Central Bank announced additional loosening in its monetary policy last month.For domestic investors, she favors sectors like technology that offer the prospect of growing dividend payments, and she highlighted the virtues of convertible bonds as \u201ca nice diversifier to one\u2019s exposure to risk assets.\u201d Convertibles generally make regular interest payments, as other bonds do, and because the bonds can be converted into a certain number of the issuing company\u2019s shares, they are a bet on continued growth in stock prices.Ms. Hooper supported the idea of having two ways to win because she didn\u2019t want to rely on just one in today\u2019s climate.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about stretched valuations,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect the stock market to go much further in the back half of the year.\u201dMr. Koesterich, the BlackRock strategist, likewise questioned how much further the good times would roll. He favored a diverse range of assets, including European and Japanese stocks, energy stocks, municipal bonds and commodities. He cautioned that \u201cnone of these look like home runs from this starting point,\u201d however, and advised investors to keep their heads in the game amid the pervasive complacency.\u201cYou have to be realistic; very few things are cheap on an absolute basis,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors have been conditioned by every scare they read about in the paper to buy the dip because the conditions go away,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day they won\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gazans, Desiring Deep Change, Are Ambivalent on Egypt Cease-Fire Plan", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGAZA CITY \u2014 Maher al-Jarba, 2, one of the first casualties in the Gaza Strip when Israel resumed airstrikes after a six-hour pause on Tuesday, writhed in terror in an emergency-room bed as a nurse poked a needle into his hand. A blast had knocked the curly haired boy down 11 stone steps, fracturing his skull.So his grandmother Wedad al-Jarba might have been angry that Hamas, the militant group that dominates the Gaza Strip, did not embrace the cease-fire proposed by Egypt, and kept firing rockets as Israel briefly held its fire. Instead, she shrugged. Like many Gazans interviewed, she said she longed for a deal \u2014 one that would change life in Gaza. But she doubted Egypt\u2019s proposal would do that.\u201cEvery time, they have a cease-fire, but then everything comes back: the siege, the closures,\u201d she said. \u201cThen they bomb again.\u201dThat ambivalence is widespread in the strip, a narrow, 25-mile-long Palestinian enclave sandwiched between Israel, Egypt and the sea. It may help explain why a beleaguered Hamas kept firing even after Israeli officials declared that such a decision would justify further escalation.The daily tally of rocket attacks, airstrikes and deaths in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.Israel occupied Gaza during the 1967 Six-Day War and controls its borders, airspace and seas even now, nearly nine years after pulling out its settlers and troops. Since then, tough restrictions have effectively amounted to a blockade, reducing imports and exports to a trickle and preventing all but a few Gazans from leaving. Short but devastating wars deepen the misery.Many Gazans say they are torn between desperately wanting an end to the current round of bombings, which have killed nearly 200 Palestinians here, including almost 40 children, and a growing conviction that they cannot return to the way things once were. Even Hamas\u2019s many opponents here generally support its demands that Israel release prisoners, and along with Egypt, lift border restrictions that have gutted a weak economy.\u201cEveryone wants it to stop,\u201d said Dr. Ayman al-Sahbani, the emergency room chief at Al-Shifa Hospital here. \u201cWho would want to be bombed?\u201dSeeking to explain the Gazan problem, he listed the hospital supplies lacking because of import restrictions, even at Shifa, which at least could provide the CT scan that Maher needed that he could not get at another hospital closer to home. But then the doctor interrupted himself. The issue was not material goods, he said \u2014 it was freedoms most people take for granted.Sometimes, he said, he thinks that Israel and the world simply do not understand what it is like for Gazans, by and large, to be unable to leave what many call an open-air prison.\u201cDo they not know, or is it that their people are people and ours are not?\u201d he said, adding that he cannot go to medical conferences and his wife, a Ukrainian, has not gone home for years for fear she would not be allowed to return.Under a date palm at the Batoon cafe\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0night, three old friends described how they spent their precious six hours without airstrikes \u2014 shopping and visiting adult children they had not seen during a week spent indoors huddling.The friends concluded that Hamas could not commit to a cease-fire accord put forth without its participation and one that did not reflect Palestinian aspirations. \u201cWe have the right to defend ourselves against occupation,\u201d said one, Radwan Abu Haseera, 36, a management professor.Another, giving only a nickname, Abu Anas, 45, said he was surprised Hamas did not pause its attacks. Many Gazans oppose Hamas but are powerless against its arms, he said, and while differences are forgotten under Israeli fire, people want change and peace, even if it means compromise.\u00a0\u201cThe people here look steadfast,\u201d he said, \u201cbut psychologically they are very tired.\u201d His 2-year-old daughter, he said, \u201clooks at the sky and thinks the clouds are smoke from rockets.\u201d \u201cShe looks at the stars,\u201d he said, \u201cand she thinks they are airplanes.\u201dYet Hamas supporters viewed the cease-fire proposal with deep suspicion. Earlier, when officials from the Palestinian Authority, which embraced the deal, visited the hospital, Hamas security officers and supporters threw shoes them. Then they cheered as a rocket ripped skyward.\u201cYa Qassam, ya habib,\u201d they chanted, referring with a term of endearment to the Hamas militant brigades that fire the rockets. \u201cStrike, strike Tel Aviv.\u201dAdvertisement"}

President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande expressed outrage at the attack, which took place at a school in Albi, in southern France.Mr. Hamon said that the attacker\u2019s child had been in the school for only a month and a half, and that the mother had had little contact with the school staff until Friday. It was unclear whether her 5-year-old daughter was in class during the attack.The police and city officials would not comment on possible reasons for the attack on the teacher, Fabienne Terral-Calm\u00e8s, 34, who had two small daughters, Mr. Hamon said.Marie-Odile Gay, a member of the regional health and safety committee for the Education Ministry, said that the mother thought the teacher had called her daughter a thief, and that misperception might have played a role in the attack.Ms. Gay said that the mother, 47, had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had been accused by the police earlier this year of abandoning her 15-year-old son. Her 5-year-old daughter was put in the care of social services.Some teachers complained that staff cuts had left teachers more vulnerable, and urged better attention to the tensions they face with some parents.But a fellow teacher, Robert Couffignal, of the regional teachers union, insisted that the attack was an \u201cisolated case\u201d and warned against going overboard with security measures.\u201cMetal detectors at schools are not the answer,\u201d Mr. Couffignal said. \u201cWe want to have close contact with the parents that creates a link of trust.\u201dHe said the larger problem for schools was tension over a weak economy and a lack of job prospects for young people, especially those from poor or immigrant backgrounds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Learning Personal Finance as a Life Skill", "Date": "2014-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationTHE HAGUE \u2014 As the world claws its way out of an economic crisis, a recent global comparative study on the financial literacy of 15-year-olds has placed a spotlight on the growing importance of economic competency training in secondary schools.The study, the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 18 different countries, produced some surprising results: For example, young people in the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, know less about money than their peers in eight other countries; and teenagers in the Shanghai region outscored everyone else, despite living in a nominally communist country.Much less of a surprise is the fact that, compared with other skills tested and tallied by the study, like math, reading and problem solving, the skill of money management is not one that most young people have grasped.Experts appear to agree that this is an increasingly necessarily skill, but that the PISA findings show that not enough has been done to teach it.\u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, the O.E.C.D. secretary general, called the results a \u201cSputnik moment,\u201d referring to the turning point in the Cold War space race. And Queen M\u00e1xima of the Netherlands, who presented the results in her function as a special advocate of the United Nations secretary general, said the results served as a \u201cwake-up call.\u201dBut the inclusion of financial literacy in PISA, considered the most important global comparison of 15-year-olds, is a sign that the subject is taking center stage in the education discussion around the world, paving the way for its inclusion in already packed primary and secondary school curriculums. In countries where it is being taught, financial literacy has been in classrooms for less than five years, but many national programs are currently being developed, strengthened and formalized with a network of leading countries discussing and comparing advantages and strategies.Besides having to understand a more complicated array of financial products available to increasingly younger consumers, young people are more often forced to make major financial decisions early, as many economies turn away from state-funded health care, welfare and higher education, experts say.\u201cIf you have less job security, you need to think harder about saving and creating financial buffers,\u201d said Mathijs van Dijk, a finance professor at the Rotterdam School of Management.\u201cThere\u2019s been a shift, from risk being held centrally, to risk being held by individuals,\u201d said Mark Fiander, a director at Money Advice Services, an independent agency created by the British government in 2010 giving citizens free advice on financial matters and debt reduction.Like other financial experts, Mr. Fiander warns that many adults are having a difficult time keeping their financial affairs in order. \u201cEven in the good times, certainly in the U.K., you have about a third of people who struggle to make it to the end of month without running out of money,\u201d he said.In response, countries have developed different ways to improve financial literacy, competency or behavior \u2014 the terms vary \u2014 among the young. Some focus on training teachers, others on providing curriculum material, making the subject accessible through mobile apps, or focusing on specific events, such as a national financial literacy week.Flore-Anne Messy, a senior policy expert at the O.E.C.D.\u2019s International Network on Financial Education, who was closely involved with the design of the financial literacy portion of the PISA study, explained that besides national strategies for better financial literacy, the impetus of different global players to train their young varied. Citing the example of the Czech Republic, which did particularly well in the study, Ms. Messy said: \u201cWhen they moved from communism to capitalism, they needed to train the new generation, because they knew that the welfare system is changing.\u201dThe newest financial literacy portion of PISA tested approximately 29,000 15-year-olds in Australia; the Flemish community of Belgium; Shanghai; Colombia; Croatia; the Czech Republic; Estonia; France; Israel; Italy; Latvia; New Zealand; Poland; Russia; Slovakia; Slovenia; Spain; and the United States, representing that age group in 40 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product.There were five levels of difficulty in the test, which was taken by students in 2012. The results, published this month first in Paris and then in Washington and other partner countries around the world, varied widely across countries. Shanghai, Flemish Belgium and Estonia scored best when it came to the overall PISA score. But students in Australia, New Zealand and the Czech Republic had the best financial sense compared with their scores in other PISA subjects. Colombia, Italy and Slovakia scored the lowest in overall ranking, with Israel \u2014 fourth from the bottom \u2014 doing especially poorly in financial literacy compared with its general PISA score. The United States came in ninth, just below the O.E.C.D. average and just above Russia, with its financial literacy score roughly in line with its scores in other PISA subjects.\u201cIf you look at the questions, they are very basic \u2014 the results are not very encouraging,\u201d said Mr. van Dijk, the Dutch finance professor.One encouraging result was that gender, in almost all countries that participated, was insignificant, a positive difference from gender gaps in adult financial literacy, according to the O.E.C.D.New Zealand was one of the countries that did very well in the study.\u201cIt is an aggregate of things,\u201d said Diane Maxwell, the retirement commissioner of New Zealand. Despite its name, the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income, which Ms. Maxwell heads, devotes about 75 percent of its efforts to training those who are furthest from retirement.\u201cI\u2019d rather deal with people when they are 13,\u201d she said in a telephone interview.\u201cWe need to prepare the next generation for a very different retirement landscape.\u201dThe commission has been overseeing an investment of half a million New Zealand dollars, or about $430,000, by the country\u2019s financial sector to build curriculums and learning aids, many of which can be found on a special website available to all teachers. Ms. Maxwell, who oversees various programs to train teachers, says one of the most important aspect of teaching financial literacy is getting the teachers comfortable with subject.\u201cMany understand for the first time what the impact of being financially more literate could be on someone\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had a fire in their belly about what it means and why it matters.\u201dThe Dutch, who were not among the nations in the most recent comparative study \u2014 though they will be part of 40 additional economies where financial literacy will be tested by PISA in 2015 \u2014 run a program called Money Wise, coordinated by the Ministry of Finance with support from various of financial service providers.Part of the program focuses on changing general aspects of school curriculums to include more emphasis on financial transactions. Another aspect of the program is a National Money Week, usually held in March, when financial experts go to schools to give guest lectures. Olaf Simonse, the head of Money Wise, estimated that during this year\u2019s National Money Week some 5,000 guest lessons were given to 150,000 school children.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tyler Cowen on Inequality and What Really Ails America", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomics Q. and A.Is it misguided to focus so much attention on the vast income chasm opening between the very rich and the rest? Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University, evidently thinks so.Earlier this year, Mr. Cowen published a pointed critique of the French economist Thomas Piketty\u2019s tome on inequality, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d He declared himself unconvinced with Mr. Piketty\u2019s interpretation of economic history and dismissed the \u201cfar-fetched plan\u201d to impose a global tax on wealth to radically redistribute capitalism\u2019s fruits.Inequality is running amok. The richest one percent of Americans pull more than a fifth of the nation\u2019s income. The top 10 percent take half, more than during the Roaring Twenties. President Obama seems to believe this is \u201cthe defining issue of our time.\u201d Is it?\u201cIncome inequality\u201d consists of at least three separate issues: 1) the top one percent is earning more; 2) the relative return to education is rising; and 3) economic growth is slow, and thus many lower- and middle-income groups are not seeing their incomes rise very much over time. The third of these is arguably the defining issue of our time. Grouping these issues all together under the broad heading of \u201cincome inequality\u201d I view as a big intellectual mistake. So should we worry at all about the chasm opening up between the income of the rich and the rest?I worry about stagnation in the middle and towards the bottom, not the income gap per se. A lot of the income growth at the top has come from globalization; for instance, Apple now sells a lot of iPhones to China. That\u2019s not something we should be worried about. Rather, we should celebrate it.But aren\u2019t soaring incomes at the top and stagnant wages in the middle connected, driven by the same forces? Those two problems are not always the same. If today we had a rate of technological innovation comparable to say 1890-1930, the middle class and the poor would benefit tremendously from those new goods and services. Income inequality might go up or down but we could stop worrying so much about it.That earlier period brought such innovations as electricity, the automobile, radio, the airplane, basic advances in public health, and much better fertilizers, among many others. In more recent times we\u2019ve had a lot of innovations in the manipulation and storage of information, but this just hasn\u2019t benefited ordinary lives as much.What about other consequences of inequality? There is evidence that it hurts mobility, sapping young men\u2019s incentives to succeed. Some have suggested it corrupts our political system and could fuel social unrest. We know very little about what income inequality tends to cause in politics. We do see that income inequality is up considerably and crime is down considerably. We do know that older societies, as we are becoming, tend to be more peaceful and stable. We also see that a rising middle class often leads to political instability, such as in Thailand or Turkey or Brazil or for that matter the United States in the 1960s. Many young American men may be experiencing a crisis of confidence these days, but the problem lies in the absolute quality of their opportunities, not the gap between them and Bill Gates. What, in your view, is driving inequality? Is it executive pay run amok? Is it globalization, or technology, or the growing footprint of finance? Or is it, as Thomas Piketty proposes, that the rate of return to capital is higher than economic growth \u2014 multiplying the income from wealth faster than income from work can grow? Globalization has increased returns at the top and led to increasing competitive pressures for middle class labor in the wealthy countries. The growth of information technology has destroyed many jobs and created others, but over all the new jobs require higher levels of skill than the old manufacturing jobs.Social changes have meant that many families have fallen apart. We measure the value of workers more precisely than in times past, which helps the most talented but also leads to more firings. Those are some of the main forces.Political privilege for those at the top is indeed one force, but usually its importance is overrated, as most of the very rich in America have been wealth creators. As for Piketty, measured risk-free rates of return on capital have been falling for more than 30 years. I\u2019d love to meet his stockbroker and get some tips. Is there anything that we can do to slow or reverse these forces? There is a lot we could do to help people at the bottom, most of all by increasing the quality and affordability of housing, health care and education. We should indeed do those things, but we are fooling ourselves to think this will lower measured income inequality by a game-changing amount. In fact, it might boost measured inequality by creating additional well-heeled customers for the top innovators. You and other thinkers on the right have proposed that cultural factors play a large role in the widening income gap. What are you suggesting? Note that the observed stagnation in earnings has plagued male earners, not women. Women continue to do better in the work force and also in education, or if they choose not to advance this is often a voluntary decision, linked to childbearing.Men are perhaps better suited for old-style manufacturing jobs, and women are often better suited for service sector jobs. A lot of men seem to have problems with discipline and conscientiousness.If we are looking for a remedy, a greater interest in strict religions would help many of the poor a lot \u2014 how about Mormonism for a start? Just look at the data. Many other religions prohibit or severely limit alcohol, drugs and gambling. That said, this has to happen privately rather than as a matter of state policy.So, your conclusion is we should obsess less about rising inequality in America. We should focus policy on increasing the quality and affordability of housing, health care and education, and on raising the rate of technological advancement. If we did that, we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about this red herring of \u201cinequality\u201d writ large any more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Strike Threat Looms, Stalled L.I.R.R. Talks Carry Hint of the Past", "Date": "2014-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Long Island Rail Road lurches toward a possible strike that could shut it down as soon as Sunday, the long-running dispute between the railroad and its unions carries echoes of the last time workers walked out. But in the final week before the strike deadline, the gap between the two sides is actually much smaller this time around.When the last strike came, in 1994, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the railroad, could not persuade the unions to accept pay raises that matched those the authority had agreed to give to city transit workers. The workers on Long Island were demanding wage increases twice as big and, because they were covered by federal law, could threaten to strike without fear of punishment. So they did. On a Friday in mid-June of that year, they left more than 100,000 commuters stranded without their usual way of getting to work. The chaos that followed pushed the governor, Mario M. Cuomo, to order the authority to give in to most of the unions\u2019 demands, and the strike ended after just one weekday. In the current negotiations, the authority has already increased its original offer significantly. But union leaders have refused to accept the concessions, maintaining that their members are ready to walk off the job at the first opportunity, which will arrive just after midnight on July 20.The unions may be counting on Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to respond the same way his father did. But so far, the governor, who has intervened in other labor negotiations, has indicated that he would stay out of this one. What he may be counting on is that in these talks, the distance to be bridged does not appear to be that wide.The unions, which have been working without a contract since 2010, have demanded raises that total 17 percent over six years. The authority initially offered what amounted to increases totaling 4 percent over five years, but has gradually increased its offer to 17 percent over seven years. To pay for the raises for its existing work force, the authority insists that new employees must shoulder a greater share of the cost of their health benefits. It wants those workers to contribute 4 percent of their salaries to help pay for that coverage, and is proposing that current employees contribute 2 percent of their earnings. The authority also wants new employees to pay more toward their pensions than existing employees do.Anthony Simon, who is leading the negotiations for the unions, said on Thursday that they had presented a new counteroffer to Thomas F. Prendergast, the chairman of the authority, but Mr. Simon declined to share any details. Formal discussions between the two sides were expected to resume on Monday.Though putting heavier burdens on those yet to be hired has become common in labor contracts, leaders of the Long Island Rail Road unions have resisted dividing their current and future members into two classes. Now, the key question for them is whether their members really are willing to forgo paychecks now to protect the benefits of co-workers to come.The last time the railroad\u2019s workers went on strike, the American economy was not struggling through a slow recovery, as it is now. It was in the midst of a boom that was producing jobs at a rapid pace.During the most recent major transit strike in the country, in the San Francisco area last fall, public support for the workers\u2019 position was not strong. That walkout shut down the Bay Area Rapid Transit system for five days before a settlement was reached that gave the workers annual raises of 3 to 4 percent in exchange for bigger contributions from them toward their health and pension plans.In New York, the state\u2019s Taylor Law prohibits the union workers who operate the city\u2019s subways and bus lines from striking. Nonetheless, the workers walked out for 60 hours just before Christmas in 2005, leaving city residents and commuters alike scrambling to get around.Governor Cuomo intervened in the latest contract negotiations between the transportation authority and Transit Workers Union Local 100, announcing in mid-April a settlement that gave the workers annual raises of 1 to 2 percent over five years and increased their contributions to their health care plans. When the authority tried to use that agreement as a model for its talks with the Long Island Rail Road workers, the unions balked. After a federal mediation panel said that offer was not as reasonable as what the unions were asking for, union leaders began preparing their members for a strike. In June, the authority said it had made a new offer that would cost it about $40 million \u2014 the same price it put on the demands the unions had presented to the mediation board. The revised strategy appeared to put the unions in the position of threatening to strike over an offer that was roughly equal in value to one they themselves had put forward.If the unions have felt moved to yield in any significant way on the demands they presented to the mediation board, they have not said so in public. After disclosing the new offer on Thursday, Mr. Simon would say only that there had been \u201cgood discussions\u201d about it and that he would await a call from the authority\u2019s negotiators.He declined to rule out a strike as early as Sunday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "There Goes the Neighborhood Cafe", "Date": "2014-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorI OPENED my first restaurant, Union Square Cafe, nearly 30 years ago, at a time when Manhattan rents were low, crime rates were high and the future of the city seemed, even for an optimist like me, to be an open question.I\u2019m confident that we will find a new home, but the very prospect of taking Union Square Cafe out of Union Square is a heartbreaking pill to swallow. Despite its tight-cornered, low-ceilinged, multilevel eccentricities, we\u2019ve loved that space. But above all we love the neighborhood that has grown around us \u2014 and whose character now, thanks to soaring rents, is being altered. Like many of the restaurants that opened during the first decades of the city\u2019s rebirth, we have built close relationships with those who came to define our surroundings: greenmarket farmers, publishers, agents, authors, architects, artists, advertising executives, actors, neighborhood activists, civic leaders and a legion of families who moved into the nearby lofts that once held men\u2019s garment manufacturers. Long before Starbucks popularized the phrase \u201cthe third place\u201d \u2014 somewhere to interact outside of work and home \u2014 it was neighborhood restaurants that helped to define places like Union Square. It\u2019s hard to come to grips with the notion that our success has, in part, contributed to our inability to remain in our neighborhood. There are neither victims nor villains in this story; no sympathy is being asked for, and no fingers are being pointed. But as a city, we\u2019ve got a problem.Because the market suggests they can, landlords are using this moment to demand the significantly higher rents they\u2019ve been waiting for since first betting on their neighborhoods. In our case, the advertised rent is triple what we are now paying. We aren\u2019t alone. In the past year, all kinds of pioneering restaurants that helped set the table for their respective neighborhoods \u2014 including Mesa Grill, in the Flatiron district, and WD-50 on the Lower East Side \u2014 have each lost out to untenable rent escalations. My hunch is that they won\u2019t be replaced by restaurants that will become similar pillars of their neighborhood.For the condos and chain stores that may replace us, such costs can be absorbed or passed on to consumers. But that sort of economics doesn\u2019t work for neighborhood restaurants. Our food and wine isn\u2019t inexpensive, but it\u2019s not unreasonably priced. To change that value equation would be inhospitable to our guests and go against our reason for existing. Nor would it allow us to continue to provide an upward career path for our dedicated employees.It is sad that the more \u201csuccessful\u201d a neighborhood becomes, the more it gradually takes on a recognizable, common look, as the same banks, drugstore chains and national brands move in. Be honest: Would you rather have one more bank branch in your neighborhood, or another independent restaurant? Compare this with a place like London, where neighborhoods have, for generations, succeeded in retaining their distinctive identities and institutions. There are scores of restaurants and pubs that are far, far older than Union Square Cafe. Landlords permit classic establishments to endure even when their original operators sell them, for there is something in that culture that prizes continuity, even over maximized profit. We may never be like London, but I wonder if we would find ourselves in this situation if New York had something like London\u2019s Rent Assessment Panel, a government committee that resolves rent disputes and is credited with helping prevent rapid erosion of the city\u2019s neighborhood fabric. I opened Union Square Cafe when I was just 27 years old, and my first hope was simply that it would stay in business. My higher hope was that in its lifetime, it might grow to play an essential role in the lives of its stakeholders. I wanted our employees, patrons, neighbors, suppliers and investors to feel that their lives were enriched in some measure because the restaurant existed in the first place. I think we\u2019ve done that, and I have nothing but gratitude for the opportunity. Anyone who has lived in this city for a while understands that the only constant is change \u2014 and, in fairness, we\u2019ve reaped our share from our investment in the community. We expect and even enjoy the churn that makes our city so dynamic, whether it\u2019s revolving restaurants or Broadway shows. Still, we need to consider the consequences of a city economy wired to spit out otherwise healthy businesses \u2014 establishments that helped to make it feel like New York in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Draghi Calls for Closer Economic Integration in Europe", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said on Wednesday that countries in the euro zone should be compelled to take steps to improve the performance of their economies in the same way that they are already required to observe rules on government spending.At a time when many voters and political leaders are complaining about what they see as the overbearing power of the European Union, Mr. Draghi called for more integration rather than less in a speech on Wednesday in London.Countries that lag economically are a risk to their euro zone partners and should be required to change their policies, Mr. Draghi said.\u201cThere is a case for some form of common governance over structural reforms,\u201d Mr. Draghi said, according to a text of his remarks. \u201cThis is because the outcome of structural reforms \u2014 a continuously high level of productivity and competitiveness \u2014 is not merely in a country\u2019s own interest. It is in the interest of the union as a whole.\u201dMr. Draghi has frequently called for euro zone governments to take steps to improve growth, such as making it easier for companies to hire and fire workers, removing bureaucratic obstacles to starting a business, and rolling back regulations that limit competition.But it was the first time that Mr. Draghi had proposed that such changes become an obligation for euro zone members. Countries in the currency union are supposed to observe rules on government budget deficits and total debt, though the rules have often been flouted.Mr. Draghi\u2019s call for a more tightly bound euro zone coincides with a debate in Britain, which is not a member of the currency bloc, about leaving the European Union. And Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments follow significant gains made in May by anti-Europe parties in elections to the European Parliament.As an example, Mr. Draghi noted that the World Economic Forum ranked Finland third in the world in terms of global competitiveness while Greece ranked 91st. \u201cThe persistence of such differences creates the risk of permanent imbalances,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Perhaps wary of appearing to dictate government policy, Mr. Draghi did not say exactly how common rules would be created or enforced. But he alluded to a \u201csupranational body\u201d like the International Monetary Fund that would push for economic reforms.Mr. Draghi also praised countries including Spain and Greece, which he said had increased exports as a result of steps taken to improve the business climate.\u201cSo while lack of reform can threaten the cohesion of the union, we can already see how decisive reform can strengthen it,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the executive board of the central bank, delivered a similar message during a speech in Athens earlier on Wednesday. Eventually, Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said, countries should transfer some responsibility over public spending to a European authority, part of what he referred to as a new social contract.But Mr. Coeur\u00e9 added that such a step would be possible only \u201cafter growth has resumed, unemployment and inequalities have receded, and economies have sufficiently converged.\u201dAdvertisement"}

National Transportation Safety Board numbers show that since 1994 alone, fatalities have dropped by 41 percent, from 730 that year to 432 in 2012.No one does more to study and improve aviation safety than the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. Our Air Safety Institute analyzes fatal accidents, offers more than 200 safety courses and takes brutally honest looks at how mistakes can lead to tragedy. We preach and teach risk management.Small aircraft help our nation move forward, contributing more than $150 billion annually to the economy and supporting more than a million jobs. Forward motion always involves risk. But these risks are successfully mitigated by the hundreds of thousands of pilots who fly safely for more than 25 million hours each year.To the Editor:While Damian Fowler quotes accurate accident statistics, he does not mention that these accidents rarely harm anybody on the ground. Small planes are about as dangerous as motorcycles, with the difference being that pilots are much more in control of the risks. Just as with a motorcycle, if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with the pilot, don\u2019t get in the plane.Most pilots already carry some form of insurance, and insurance companies often do in fact require higher standards of training. If requiring more insurance does reduce accidents, it will only be because responsible, middle-class pilots are forced out of pursuing their passion by the cost.We do not need to regulate or price every activity with any amount of risk out of existence. If you don\u2019t like the risk, don\u2019t get in the plane. I\u2019ll wave from above.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Did Dodd-Frank Work?", "Date": "2014-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are many aspects of the law on which Democrats and Republicans disagree. But there is one area in which the two sides are largely in agreement: \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d is still with us.\u201cIn no way, shape or form does the Dodd-Frank Act end too big to fail,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.Dodd-Frank, of course, was supposed to end \u201cToo Big to Fail,\u201d the catchphrase for a financial institution whose collapse had the potential to bring down the entire financial system. That prospect is why, less than a month after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the government handed billions of dollars to the big banks to help stabilize them.In some ways, eliminating the possibility of future bank bailouts was the whole point of Dodd-Frank. Partly this was for populist reasons: Americans were outraged that the banks were bailed out, while the country got the worst of the Great Recession.But it was also just good public policy. Karen Petrou, the managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, told me that if the too-big-to-fail provisions in the law worked, \u201cthe rest of the law wouldn\u2019t matter that much because the market would discipline the institutions.\u201d But, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think the Federal Reserve or the F.D.I.C.\u201d \u2014 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \u2014 \u201cis prepared to handle a systemic crisis for one of the big banks.\u201dTo be sure, the Treasury Department insists that the days of \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d are over. In a recent speech, Mary John Miller, the Treasury\u2019s undersecretary for domestic finance, said, \u201cNo financial institution, regardless of its size, will be bailed out by taxpayers again.\u201d She added, \u201cShareholders of failed companies will be wiped out; creditors will absorb losses; culpable management will not be retained and may have their compensation clawed back.\u201d But the markets don\u2019t believe it, and neither do most people who pay attention to Dodd-Frank.There are two essential problems. The first is that it is hard to imagine that the government wouldn\u2019t blink, as it did in 2008. \u201cDoes anyone really believe that if any of the big banks were about to go down, that the government would allow that to happen?\u201d asked Dean Baker, a co-founder of the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research. \u201cNo.\u201dThe second problem is that it is difficult to envision how the law itself would \u201cresolve\u201d these institutions. In one part of Dodd-Frank, the banks are required to write \u201cliving wills,\u201d laying out how they could wind down without causing a financial catastrophe. Although they are now on their third round of living wills, the documents are thousands of pages, and the government hasn\u2019t yet told them whether the second round of living wills, filed a year or so ago, passed muster. Meanwhile, there is another part of Dodd-Frank that calls for banks to wind down through a process called orderly liquidation. In this scenario, the government puts the functioning parts of the bank into a new \u201cbridge financial company,\u201d and forces the private sector \u2014 shareholders, certain creditors, even assessments on other financial institutions if it comes to that \u2014 to take losses. Although the Treasury Department insists that the law forbids public money from being used, there are a lot of economists who have a hard time believing that taxpayer money would not somehow be used if things got really bad.One person who does believe is Sheila Bair, the former chairwoman of the F.D.I.C. \u201cI do think they could handle a big bank failure,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt would be messy and difficult, but they could do it.\u201dWhich is the ultimate problem: We have no way of knowing whether \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d still exists until we have another crisis. Let\u2019s just hope we don\u2019t have to find out anytime soon. David Brooks and Frank Bruni are off today. Advertisement"}

I spend money so much more wisely than government.\u201dThree blocks later, Babbitt, as we\u2019ll call him, swerves to avoid one pothole and lands in another. There\u2019s a sickening thud. With a sinking heart, Babbitt gets out to examine the damage.\u201c*@# government!\u201d he curses. \u201cThey can\u2019t even fix the roads. Now I\u2019ve got a flat, and my rim is bent! What\u2019s the point of owning a hot car when the government can\u2019t even fix the roads?\u201dBabbitt calls a tow truck and gets to the office two hours late, missing a meeting with a client. \u201cThe government is like George III,\u201d he moans. \u201cRobs us blind and doesn\u2019t do anything for us!\u201dVoters like Babbitt will play a major role in this year\u2019s elections, and politicians are often too timid to point out the blunt truth: Sometimes money is better spent by the government than by individuals. Indeed, it seems to me that we\u2019re at a point where we would be better off as a nation paying a bit more in taxes and in exchange getting better schools, safer food, less congested roads \u2014 and, over all, a higher standard of living.America\u2019s infrastructure is now so wretched that, in some areas, the only people who drive straight are the drunks. Anyone who is sober swerves to avoid potholes.In New Jersey, the gas tax hasn\u2019t been increased since 1992, and two-thirds of the roads are now evaluated as in poor or mediocre condition. The upshot, one study found, is that the average motorist spends $601 per year in repair costs. It sure seems as if society would be better off spending a little in taxes to improve roads and then saving on car repairs \u2014 not to mention in injuries and fatalities averted.Yet on the campaign trail, it\u2019s a brave politician who acknowledges that taxes have their uses. Around July Fourth, we should be able to celebrate that some of our greatest national achievements aren\u2019t tax cuts but public investments:\u2022 The United States invested in the electrical grid, with public projects like the Tennessee Valley Authority and rural electrification. These hugely raised living standards and economic output.So, on Independence Day, let\u2019s celebrate a heritage not just of opposing taxation without representation, but also of wise public investment. In the 1790s, President George Washington and other patriots crushed the Whiskey Rebellion, a progenitor of modern anti-tax crusades. It\u2019s time for patriots again to defend reasonable taxes.The wealthy, in particular, pay low income taxes in the United States. And loopholes mean that the corporate tax burden is lower in the United States than among our peers.So as we celebrate July Fourth, let\u2019s get real about government. Sure, tax money is sometimes squandered, as is money in business. But what strengthens us as a nation is often investments in public goods that benefit all Americans \u2014 and, after all, there\u2019s not much point in saving on taxes to buy a Porsche when the roads all have potholes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shubert Organization Set To Add New World Stages", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Shubert Organization, a major Broadway player that owns 17 of the 40 theaters there, is positioning itself to move into the commercial Off Broadway sector in a significant way with the acquisition of the New World Stages complex, according to three theater executives with knowledge of the expected deal.Given that the Shubert Organization is a landlord to so many Broadway productions, such as the musicals \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d and \u201cChicago,\u201d it would be well positioned to broker deals to move flagging Broadway tenants to new homes with fewer seats at New World Stages.The organization also generates sizable profits from ticket sales through its Telecharge.com. New World Stages would add to its ticket revenue stream and provide other income from rent and fees, while management costs of the complex would be relatively modest because of the economies of scale achieved by the large Shubert company.The three theater executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the sale discussions were intended to be confidential, said that the sale of New World Stages did not represent a downsizing of Stage Entertainment\u2019s ambitions in New York. The company\u2019s leader, the Dutch billionaire Joop van den Ende, began exploring the sale more than a year ago, when hopes were high for \u201cRocky\u201d and well before it went into production on Broadway. The executives said that Mr. van den Ende wanted his New York office to focus on creating and producing theater work rather than devoting part of its attention to acting as a landlord at New World Stages. Stage Entertainment is developing a theatrical adaptation of the animated movie \u201cAnastasia\u201d (1997), among other projects.A spokesman for the Shubert Organization declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Stage Entertainment. The three executives said they did not know when the sale of New World Stages, expected to be in the seven figures, would be finalized and officially announced. The long-term lease for the last Broadway house on the market, the Lyric Theater (formerly the Foxwoods), went for about $60 million to the British-based Ambassador Theater Group last year. New World Stages, whose space was once a movie complex, has been in operation since 2004.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blueprints for Taming the Climate Crisis", "Date": "2014-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneHere\u2019s what your future will look like if we are to have a shot at preventing devastating climate change.Within about 15 years every new car sold in the United States will be electric. In fact, by midcentury more than half of the American economy will run on electricity. Up to 60 percent of power might come from nuclear sources. And coal\u2019s footprint will shrink drastically, perhaps even disappear from the power supply.It offers a sobering conclusion. We might be able to pull it off. But it will take an overhaul of the way we use energy, and a huge investment in the development and deployment of new energy technologies. Significantly, it calls for an entirely different approach to international diplomacy on the issue of how to combat climate change.\u201cThis will require a heroic cooperative effort,\u201d said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist who directs the Sustainable Development Solutions Network at the United Nations, which convened the multinational teams.That is less than a tenth of annual American emissions per person today and less than a third of the world average. And we haven\u2019t quite figured out how to get from here to there.The American team built several paths that would hit the target, using different mixes of nuclear power, renewable energy and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage technology. So did the Russian team, aided by the expected shrinking of the Russian population.Over all, the teams built plausible technological paths to cut annual emissions across the 15 countries only to about 2.3 tons per person.The analysis, however, offers solid ground for hope. The teams expect to improve on these paths in coming months. Faster deployment of some technologies than assumed could provide for deeper decarbonization in several countries. What\u2019s more, likely changes in economic structure in coming decades \u2014 such as China\u2019s expected shift away from heavy industry \u2014 could further shrink the carbon footprint.Most important, the assessment offers an opportunity to end decades of inconsequential horse-trading over climate change and to start addressing the problem for real.Five years since political leaders from countries around the world committed to do whatever it took to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees above the preindustrial average, no one had taken the trouble, until now, to evaluate how that might be achieved.Lacking any understanding of the feasibility of the exercise, governments postured and jockeyed over which country should be responsible for what, offering as little as they could get away with in actual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, whether the collective effort met the two-degree commitment or not.\u201cIf governments don\u2019t have any idea of what two degrees means in their countries, how can they commit to two degrees?\u201d asked Guido Schmidt-Traub, executive director of the Sustainable Development Network.This is not achievable by going after low-hanging fruit, such as replacing coal with natural gas in power plants. Doing so could even be counterproductive, locking the country\u2019s energy infrastructure into a high-carbon path.Most important, perhaps, the new assessment suggests that deep decarbonization can be done without breaking any economy. Chinese incomes, for instance, are assumed to grow about 4.6 percent a year until midcentury.The decarbonization paths rely on aggressive assumptions about our ability to deploy new technologies on a commercial scale economically. For instance, carbon capture and storage is supposed to be available starting in about 10 years. Second-generation biofuels are assumed to come into play by 2020. Hydrogen fuel cells and power storage technology are deployed starting around 2030.But these technologies all exist today and seem reasonably scalable. The teams did not rely on more speculative technologies, like cold fusion, to make their numbers.The new approach \u2014 which the United Nations hopes will inform the debate up to the next climate summit in Paris in fall 2015 \u2014 could offer a path out of the stalemate that international climate negotiations have become.\u201cGovernments won\u2019t precommit to huge technological revolutions on a legal basis,\u201d Professor Sachs said. \u201cCountries might be willing to aspire more on a conditional basis.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, countries are more likely to participate if they understand what everybody else is trying. \u201cThe Chinese want to see an American pathway to two degrees,\u201d Mr. Schmidt-Traub said.Big challenges remain. Any 40-year forecast must be taken with some skepticism. Technologies that seem feasible and economic today might turn out not to be. And it bears repeating that though the teams contend they can get to 1.6 tons per person, they have not yet.Russia, for instance, hit the target. But Oleg Lugovoy of the Environmental Defense Fund, who worked on the Russian plan, observed that \u201cif we don\u2019t have carbon capture and storage we would have to reconsider.\u201dAnd while sketching a technological path toward a low carbon economy will certainly help ground in reality the abstract negotiations over the future of climate, it does not do away with the main hitch that has stumped progress for decades: How much will this all cost and who will pay for it?The team purposefully did not assess the costs of their paths to prevent distributional arguments from flaring up immediately. That gives policy makers space to consider the implications without having to stake out a negotiating stance.An assessment of costs and how they could be distributed will be added in a next iteration to be published next spring. Debates over cost allocation and technology transfer could still hamstring prospects of substantive international collaboration.But despite these risks, the report offers a promising new path to overcome the decades-old logjam of climate change negotiations. For the first time, when we say we can stop the climate from heating we will more or less know what we are talking about.Email: eporter@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan and the Limits of Military Power ", "Date": "2014-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt is difficult to overstate the significance of what Mr. Abe has done. Since 1947, Japan\u2019s Constitution, written and imposed by the American Army, has permitted the military, known as the Self-Defense Forces, to engage only in self-defense. That meant the large and technologically advanced armed forces was barred from \u201ccollective self-defense\u201d \u2014 aiding friendly countries under attack \u2014 and thus was far more constrained than those of other nations. With the reinterpretation, Japan\u2019s military would still face restrictions on what it could do, but it would be allowed for the first time, for example, to help defend an American ship under attack, destroy a North Korean missile heading toward the United States or play a larger role in United Nations peacekeeping operations.Mr. Abe has long argued for changing the Constitution on the grounds that Japan should assert itself as a \u201cnormal\u201d country, freed of postwar constraints imposed as a consequence of its wartime atrocities and defeat. He now has another argument for expanding the military\u2019s role: Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy after the United States and China, needs to be a fuller partner with the United States in countering China as it increasingly challenges the conflicting claims of Japan and other countries in the South China and East Asia Seas. Washington has long urged Tokyo to assume more of the regional security burden.What stood in Mr. Abe\u2019s way was Article 9 of the Constitution. It says the Japanese people \u201cforever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.\u201d Any change should have required a constitutional revision, which would mean winning two-thirds approval in both houses of Parliament, followed by a referendum. Instead, Mr. Abe circumvented that process by having his government reinterpret the Constitution.The prospect of altering Japan\u2019s military\u2019s role is controversial as well as consequential, with many Japanese citizens voicing fears about being dragged into foreign entanglements. Several polls showed that 50 percent of all respondents opposed the reinterpretation; in recent days, thousands of people have protested in front of the prime minister\u2019s residence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Announces a Military Shift to Thwart China", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s prime minister announced a reinterpretation of the country\u2019s pacifist Constitution on Tuesday, freeing its military for the first time in over 60 years to play a more assertive role in the increasingly tense region.The decision by the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will permit Japan to use its large and technologically advanced armed forces in ways that would have been unthinkable even a decade ago when they were limited to defending the country. The revision will allow the military to come to the aid of friendly countries under attack, including the United States.Japan\u2019s stance is part of a rapidly shifting balance of power in Asia, where China and its growing military are mounting a serious challenge to the regional dominance of the United States and its allies, including Japan, and making assertive claims to vast areas of two strategically important seas. The hawkish Mr. Abe\u2019s response is certain to anger the Chinese \u2014 who have never forgiven Japan for its World War II-era invasion \u2014 and could set Asia\u2019s two biggest powers even more on edge.\u201cThe growing pressure from China has changed the political debate within Japan,\u201d said Kazuhisa Kawakami, a political expert at Meiji Gakuin University in Tokyo. The Abe government\u2019s decision, which appears likely to go into effect this fall, was announced as China\u2019s leader was set to arrive in Seoul for what many analysts viewed as an attempt to begin to pry away South Korea from its traditional ally, the United States.The new policy is the culmination of a quarter-century of debate in Japan over whether pacifism was the best way to assure the world that it would never again fall into the mind-set that led it to conquer much of Asia and pursue a disastrous war, or whether, decades after Japan\u2019s defeat, that thinking had made the country vulnerable to new threats.The antiwar Constitution remains enough of a touchstone for many in Japan that the reinterpretation has spurred rare street protests, and even the self-immolation of a lone protester in Tokyo this week. But at least so far, the pushback against the change, termed \u201ccollective self-defense,\u201d seemed fairly limited after years of headlines about Chinese military planes and ships challenging Japan\u2019s near disputed islands.While Japan\u2019s military, known as the Self-Defense Forces, would still face severe restrictions on what it could do, it would be allowed for the first time to take such actions as come to the aid of an American ship under attack, or shoot down a North Korean missile heading toward the United States. The Obama administration said Tuesday that it welcomed Japan\u2019s action, adding that it would aid the country\u2019s armed forces to \u201cdo more within the framework of our alliance.\u201d But the Abe government\u2019s move also posed challenges for the president. His administration has struggled to patch up differences between Japan and South Korea, which is also bitter over Japan\u2019s imperialist history, and managing the tensions with China may now prove more difficult than ever before.Japanese leaders for years have been edging their country away from its passive security stance. They agreed to join Western efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan by transporting cargo and refueling other navies\u2019 ships, bought weapons that blurred the lines between defensive and offensive, and under Mr. Abe, doled out increasing military-related aid to neighbors who share Japan\u2019s anxiety over China.But the latest move differs from many of those actions in that it fundamentally changes the reading of the postwar Constitution and seems to take Japan further than ever from the renunciation of force as a way of settling disputes.Mr. Abe, a longtime influential conservative, has tried in the past to win approval for a wholesale rewriting of the Constitution, part of his campaign to make Japan what he calls a more \u201cnormal\u201d country that no longer hides its power out of shame for wartime transgressions. Lack of public support for those attempts, in part, cost him his job seven years ago, the last time he was prime minister.Since then, the region has been transformed not only by China\u2019s rise, but also a deterioration of American dominance that is leading several countries in the region to try to beef up their own military abilities.Although Asia is not yet in an outright arms race, Richard J. Samuels, director of the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Japan\u2019s move showed that it and other countries were having to think more seriously about their own security than ever before.\u201cThis is a recognition among these nations that U.S. capabilities are not what they were,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are looking for a way to keep the U.S. in the neighborhood while also reaching out to each other in new ways.\u201dIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan experimented for the first time in joining United Nations peacekeeping operations; even that seemingly innocuous use of the military spurred major protests. American officials also spent years in secret talks about what kind of facilities in Japan would be available to them in case they needed a staging area in any conflict with North Korea; again, Japanese politicians and bureaucrats were leery of seeming to be too helpful, even though their own territory was at risk.But more nationalistic politicians, including Mr. Abe, began the debate about ensuring Japan was not so beholden to Washington for its defense. And books like \u201cThe Japan That Can Say No,\u201d written by the founder of Sony Corporation, Akio Morita, and the one-time governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, made the case that Japan needed a military policy that matched its role as the No. 2 economy in the world.China has recently increased its pursuit of territorial claims in nearby seas, leading to tense exchanges with neighboring countries. A map of some of the most notable disputes.Today, though, it is No. 3, having been displaced by China. And in the end, it is a sense of vulnerability, analysts said, rather than any notion that Japan will be on the rise again soon, that has driven the change.Mr. Abe had sought even broader leeway this year for his nation\u2019s military, but he was forced to compromise amid resistance from both his governing Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, a small Buddhist party. Under the revision, Japan\u2019s self-defense forces could act only when its leaders felt an attack on a friendly nation, or that country\u2019s armed forces, would pose a \u201cclear danger\u201d to Japan.Parliament must still clear legal barriers to the constitutional reinterpretation by revising more than a dozen laws, experts and lawmakers said. However, with Mr. Abe\u2019s governing coalition enjoying a comfortable majority in both houses, the change seemed all but certain to become reality. In a speech broadcast live on national television Tuesday, Mr. Abe sought to allay opponents\u2019 concerns by stating that the new policy would not drag Japan into distant, American-led wars. But he also said that it would help Japan forge closer ties with the United States, which has 50,000 military personnel in the country and which the Japanese government hopes will make a clearer show of support in the islands dispute with China.\u201cThis is not going to change Japan into a country that wages wars,\u201d Mr. Abe said. \u201cA strengthened Japan-United States alliance is a force of deterrence that contributes to the peace of Japan and this region.\u201d In Washington, a senior administration official characterized the changes as one of \u201cgetting Japan up to a normal baseline of operations in collective self-defense.\u201d But it was also a recognition, the official said, that the constraints on Japan\u2019s military were unworkable: In Iraq, Japanese forces were prohibited from coming to the defense of other members of the coalition. And while the president of the Philippines said in Tokyo last week that he supported Japan\u2019s doing more to help offset China\u2019s increasingly assertive claims in the region, China and South Korea argued in the run-up to Mr. Abe\u2019s announcement that a rearmed Japan raises bitter memories. A commentary by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news service, warned that Mr. Abe was \u201cdallying with the specter of war.\u201d While Mr. Abe focused his comments on closer ties with the United States, analysts said the new policy could also make it easier for Japan to seek new military alliances with the Philippines and other nations that have similar territorial disputes with China.\u201cJapan is experiencing a security renaissance,\u201d said Andrew L. Oros, director of international studies at Washington College in Chestertown, Md. \u201cWhat is remarkable is not that things are changing, but that they are changing with so little fanfare.\u201dMartin Fackler reported from Tokyo, and David E.

{"Headline": "German Man Arrested as Spy Implicates U.S.", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 In the latest turn in the yearlong tensions with Germany over American spying, a German man was arrested this week on suspicion of passing secret documents to a foreign power, believed to be the United States. The American ambassador, John B. Emerson, was summoned to the Foreign Office here and urged to help with what German officials called a swift clarification of the case.While the White House and American intelligence officials refused to comment on the arrest, one senior American official said that reports in the German news media that the 31-year-old man under arrest had been working for the United States for at least two years \u201cthreaten to undo all the repair work\u201d the two sides have been trying to achieve.The details of the latest case were murky. The news media reports suggested that the man, a midlevel employee of the Federal Intelligence Service, was originally arrested on suspicion of spying for Russia. The Kremlin has markedly stepped up recruitment of German informants since the uprisings in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions aimed at Russia\u2019s economy.But according to the news reports and the account of the American official, the man told his interrogators he had been working for the United States for some time.German news reports said that his work included reporting on the investigations into the N.S.A.\u2019s activities in Germany, which are the subject of a parliamentary inquiry, but the American official said he had no knowledge of whether that was the case. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid complicating a diplomatically fragile intelligence issue. The Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency both declined to comment on the allegations.Ms. Merkel was informed of the case on Thursday, her spokesman said, just before she spoke to President Obama by telephone. But the White House described that conversation as one that was primarily about Ukraine and the continuing negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. Neither German nor American officials would say on the record whether the subject of the arrest came up during the call. But another senior United States official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the president\u2019s conversations were intended to be private, said the issue did not come up on the call, which was previously scheduled to discuss other matters, and that Mr. Obama was not aware of the case at the time of the call.If the man had been spying for the United States for two years, as the German news reports say, his recruitment would have predated the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the N.S.A. contractor, of the long-running tapping of Ms. Merkel\u2019s cellphone. But in conversations with German officials over the past year, the Obama administration has made it clear that its commitment extends only to Ms. Merkel herself, and not other German officials. That was one of many sources of tension as the two countries, which traditionally share intelligence on terrorism suspects and nuclear proliferation, struggled and failed to reach a new accord.The German Parliament is conducting an inquiry into the N.S.A.\u2019s activities in the country, and it heard its first testimony on Thursday from two Americans who formerly worked for the agency. That testimony came hours after a 27-year-old student in Bavaria was identified by name as one of the spy agency\u2019s surveillance targets, the first German other than Ms. Merkel to be named in that way.The testimony on Thursday lasted late into the evening, delayed in part by an extraordinary meeting between the inquiry panel and the control commission that oversees Germany\u2019s intelligence services. The lawmakers were said to have been informed of the arrest of the accused spy at that meeting; attendees at such sessions are sworn to secrecy.Part of the Thursday hearing was conducted in closed session after one of the American witnesses, William E. Binney, a former N.S.A. employee, said he would be discussing important secret information.There was no immediate confirmation from the German government or the prosecutor\u2019s office concerning the reports that the arrested man had been spying for the United States. A statement from the general prosecutor said he was detained on Wednesday by officers from the federal criminal office, the most senior police authority in Germany. It did not give details about his occupation.On Thursday, the suspect appeared before a federal court in Karlsruhe, where the federal prosecutor\u2019s office is located, and was ordered held \u201con urgent suspicion\u201d of unauthorized intelligence activities, the prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement.Hans-Christian Str\u00f6bele, a member of Parliament from the Green Party who sits on both the intelligence oversight body and the N.S.A. inquiry panel, said he had \u201cno reason to deny\u201d the published reports about the spy case. But he and the head of the inquiry panel, Patrick Sensburg of the Christian Democratic Party, each counseled caution.Mr. Sensburg said that \u201csome reports are simply false.\u201d And Mr. Str\u00f6bele, who traveled to Moscow last fall to meet with Mr. Snowden, said on Friday, \u201cWe must have patience and see whether information stands up to scrutiny.\u201d\u201cIt would be good to have a very quick reaction from across the Atlantic,\u201d he added, though he noted that on the Fourth of July, Americans \u201chave every reason to do something else.\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington. and David E.

{"Headline": "Questions and Answers About India\u2019s New Budget", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIndia Ink Q. What are your thoughts on Mr. Modi\u2019s first budget?This budget hits the right notes and emphasizes some key policy priorities, but still maintains a realistic perspective that this is only the first step of a longer process toward reviving India\u2019s growth and ensuring macroeconomic stability. The emphasis of this budget is on restoring macroeconomic stability by keeping the budget deficit and inflation under control and getting started on a modest set of reforms to build confidence and revive growth rather than instituting a full-blown package of reforms. There are many areas where the budget falls short of reforms and liberalization measures that had been hoped for. The government seems to have taken a prudent strategy of managing expectations about what it can deliver in a short time frame. Perhaps the idea is to build credibility and a track record of implementation before embarking on more ambitious reforms.Q. How do you see the investment climate in India in the coming two to five years?Domestic and business investors care about a stable macroeconomic environment, policy certainty, less restrictive labor laws, lower bureaucratic hurdles and a sound physical infrastructure. All of these will build confidence in India\u2019s long-term growth prospects.In some of these dimensions \u2014 macro policies, investment in infrastructure, indications of a more stable policy environment \u2014 this budget certainly sends the right signals. If the proposed measures are implemented effectively, it would certainly inspire confidence that this government can deliver on a broader range of much-needed reforms.Q. Do you think this budget will lead to economic recovery in India? This budget makes a modest attempt to shift the balance from populism toward reforms, although with some nods to policies that do have a redistributive element but could also be argued for on the grounds of efficiency (higher levels of tax exemptions, some new schemes). All told, this budget should serve as a catalyst for getting the economy moving in the right direction, especially now that the global economic environment appears more stable.Q. Do you think that this budget will be able to revive the manufacturing sector in India?The measures in this budget are not sufficient to quickly solve the deep-rooted problems that have held back the manufacturing sector in India. Improvements in physical infrastructure, better financial markets and more openness to foreign capital are all helpful, and the budget does take modest but positive steps in these areas. However, these measures will take time to bear fruit.Meanwhile, labor market reforms, measures to reduce bureaucracy and red tape, and other major structural reforms have not been emphasized in this budget. So a lot more needs to be done to generate a durable manufacturing sector revival in India.Q. Will this budget help generate jobs?This government is clearly eager to shift away from approaches such as employment guarantees toward relying on a higher rate of economic growth to increase employment generation. An improvement in manufacturing sector growth would help improve the availability of better-quality jobs.Greater emphasis on financial market reforms that make it easier for small and medium sized enterprises to obtain financing would also aid employment growth. It is encouraging that the budget signals that the government is going to back the RBI in its efforts in this direction.It is also encouraging that the budget pays attention to improving the skills of India\u2019s burgeoning youth population by putting more money into education. However, the amounts proposed are modest and a more substantial revamping of the education system will be needed to meet the needs of Indian enterprises.Q. Do you think that this budget paid enough attention to the poor?The budget, along with earlier statements from the finance minister, do herald a subtle shift away from populist measures that could hinder economic efficiency. It is encouraging, for instance, that the government has indicated it will continue to shift away from subsidies toward cash transfers, which will reduce leakage of social benefits before they reach their intended recipients and also avoid distortion of product markets. Unfortunately, in this budget the new government does not frontally tackle the costly and wasteful subsidy regime, perhaps not wanting to erode political support for other reforms.Nevertheless, the budget does hint at the government\u2019s approach \u2014 viewing growth as the best way to alleviate poverty rather than a focus on redistribution. Thus, the notion that this budget pays inadequate attention to the poor may not be appropriate.Q. Do you think that raising foreign direct investment limits in the defense and insurance sectors will attract more investment in India? Foreign investors will certainly be encouraged by the raising of limits on FDI. The specific measures are in some ways less important than the signal they convey \u2014 that the government will continue reducing restrictions on foreign capital inflows and will welcome foreign capital.However, as is the case with domestic investors, other aspects of India\u2019s macroeconomic and policy environment are likely to be far more important in determining the volume of FDI and other types of capital inflows into India.Q. What do you think about the measures proposed in the budget about better tax administration?Improving the efficiency of the tax and expenditure systems is a crucial component of fiscal reforms in India. The steps proposed in the budget are certainly welcome ones but quite limited in terms of what is ultimately needed for a better fiscal system. Implementation of the goods and services tax is clearly an important priority and will serve as a good measuring rod for the government\u2019s effectiveness in implementation of its broader agenda.Q. Does this budget put a greater emphasis to corporate and urban India?This distinction is important only insofar as it has implications for specific sets of policies. The budget\u2019s emphasis on disciplined fiscal policy and reforms that are intended to boost growth and tamp down inflation are important for all sectors of the economy.Having said that, there is a set of reforms that are particularly important for rural India and the budget does not seem to have much on these areas. The supply and distribution of food, in particular, needs improvement through reforms of agricultural and land policies. Moreover, changes are needed to government policies have kept the distribution system, which remains dominated by small shopkeepers and multiple layers of middlemen, inefficient and wasteful.Q. What do you think is the realistic value of the Indian rupee and how it will change in coming years?It is likely that the budget and proposed reforms will lead foreign investors to take a closer look at India, especially with monetary conditions in advanced economies still remaining loose and a lot of capital looking for higher yields. If the government succeeds in its objective of keeping the current account deficit under tight control, capital inflows could then put upward pressure on the rupee.If the budget sparks a growth revival and causes investors to revise upward their forecasts of medium-term productivity and output growth in India, then the rupee could come under more sustained appreciation pressures in the coming years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Wants a Depression?", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne unhappy lesson we\u2019ve learned in recent years is that economics is a far more political subject than we liked to imagine. Well, duh, you may say. But, before the financial crisis, many economists \u2014 even, to some extent, yours truly \u2014 believed that there was a fairly broad professional consensus on some important issues.But I now think that class interests also operate through a cruder, more direct channel. Quite simply, easy-money policies, while they may help the economy as a whole, are directly detrimental to people who get a lot of their income from bonds and other interest-paying assets \u2014 and this mainly means the very wealthy, in particular the top 0.01 percent.The story so far: For more than five years, the Fed has faced harsh criticism from a coalition of economists, pundits, politicians and financial-industry moguls warning that it is \u201cdebasing the dollar\u201d and setting the stage for runaway inflation. You might have thought that the continuing failure of the predicted inflation to materialize would cause at least a few second thoughts, but you\u2019d be wrong. Some of the critics have come up with new rationales for unchanging policy demands \u2014 it\u2019s about inflation! no, it\u2019s about financial stability! \u2014 but most have simply continued to repeat the same warnings.Who are these always-wrong, never-in-doubt critics? With no exceptions I can think of, they come from the right side of the political spectrum. But why should right-wing sentiments go hand in hand with inflation paranoia? One answer is that using monetary policy to fight slumps is a form of government activism. And conservatives don\u2019t want to legitimize the notion that government action can ever have positive effects, because once you start down that path you might end up endorsing things like government-guaranteed health insurance. But there\u2019s also a much more direct reason for those defending the interests of the wealthy to complain about easy money: The wealthy derive an important part of their income from interest on bonds, and low-rate policies have greatly reduced this income.That\u2019s a lot, and it surely explains a lot of the hysteria over Fed policy. The rich are even more likely than most people to believe that what\u2019s good for them is good for America \u2014 and their wealth and the influence it buys ensure that there are always plenty of supposed experts eager to find justifications for this attitude. Hence sadomonetarism.Which brings me back to the politicization of economics. Before the financial crisis, many central bankers and economists were, it\u2019s now clear, living in a fantasy world, imagining themselves to be technocrats insulated from the political fray. After all, their job was to steer the economy between the shoals of inflation and depression, and who could object to that?It turns out, however, that using monetary policy to fight depression, while in the interest of the vast majority of Americans, isn\u2019t in the interest of a small, wealthy minority. And, as a result, monetary policy is as bound up in class and ideological conflict as tax policy.The truth is that in a society as unequal and polarized as ours has become, almost everything is political.

A farmer back home and jack-of-all-trades, Mr. Bidawi arrived here with his wife and children a year ago, only to have his youngest daughter die in the camp, overwhelmed by tear gas fired when guards struggled to quell a riot. Everyone in Zaatari has horror stories about homes destroyed, family members lost and bad times in the camp.But now, at a pace stunning to see, Zaatari is becoming an informal city: a sudden, do-it-yourself metropolis of roughly 85,000 with the emergence of neighborhoods, gentrification, a growing economy and, under the circumstances, something approaching normalcy, though every refugee longs to return home. There is even a travel agency that will provide a pickup service at the airport, and pizza delivery, with an address system for the refugees that camp officials are scrambling to copy.The change, accelerated by regional chaos and enterprising Syrians, illustrates a basic civilizing push toward urbanization that clearly happens even in desperate places \u2014 people leaving their stamp wherever they live, making spaces they occupy their own. At the same time, Zaatari\u2019s evolution points more broadly to a whole new way of thinking about one of the most pressing crises on the planet.These vast forced migrations have accelerated discussions about the need to treat camps as more than transitional population centers, more than human holding pens with tents for transients. A number of forward-thinking aid workers and others are looking at refugee camps as potential urban incubators, places that can grow and develop and even benefit the host countries \u2014 places devised from the get-go to address those countries\u2019 long-term needs \u2014 rather than become drags on those nations.Such thinking is driven by reality: Syrian and Iraqi families, with no clear path to peace, and no other choice, their countries coming undone, find themselves facing extended exile in places like Zaatari, which the refugees are in effect retrofitting out of necessity to serve their immediate needs.\u201cYou can call a place like Zaatari impermanent and not build adequate infrastructure,\u201d as Don Weinreich, a partner at Ennead Architects in New York, recently put it. Ennead is collaborating with the United Nations refugee agency and Stanford University to reimagine how, and where, refugee camps around the world should, or shouldn\u2019t, be planned and built.\u201cBut organic development, driven by refugees, is unstoppable,\u201d Mr. Weinreich said. \u201cImpermanence costs more in the long run. Whether you encourage growth in the right ways or you fight it, it\u2019s going to happen anyway.\u201dNot that Zaatari is like downtown Amman. It is a squalid, barren, crime-ridden place. Most of those businesses and shops are unauthorized. Much of the site remains a tent city. But it\u2019s a far cry from a camp like Azraq, which Jordan and the United Nations refugee agency opened to Syrians recently, or camps in Turkey, run by the Turkish government, that have state-of-the-art facilities but are designed to suppress the sort of ground-up urbanism that has altered Zaatari.A satellite view of the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan on Sept. 3, 2012.Azraq, located miles from anywhere, is strictly policed, with fixed, corrugated metal shelters in military order, dirt floors and shameful public toilets, and it has no electricity. So far about 11,000 Syrians are marooned there. The camp is planned to house more than 100,000.Refugees at Azraq, families with small children, terrified at night without electricity to light the shelters, unprotected against the scorpions, mice and snakes, say they escaped one nightmare to arrive at another.The oldest parts of Zaatari, by contrast, now have streets, one or two paved, some lined with electric poles, the most elaborate houses cobbled together from shelters, tents, cinder blocks and shipping containers, with interior courtyards, private toilets and jerry-built sewers. Clusters of satellite dishes and water tanks on the skyline can bring to mind favelas in Rio de Janeiro or slums in Cairo. Like favelas, the camp has grown according to its own ad hoc, populist urban logic, which includes a degree of social mobility.\u201cWhat is happening at Zaatari, while causing lots of problems, also presents opportunities as the camp evolves into a complex ecosystem that you could call a city or a slum,\u201d said Daniel Kerber of Morethanshelters, a German relief agency. \u201cEither way, it\u2019s a dynamic place, unforeseen by the humanitarian actors running it, which is giving refugees a sense of ownership and dignity.\u201dMr. Kleinschmidt ticked off numbers: 14,000 households, 10,000 sewage pots and private toilets, 3,000 washing machines, 150 private gardens, 3,500 new businesses and shops. Not far from Mr. Bidawi\u2019s barbershop, Zaatari has a pet store, a flower shop and a homemade ice cream business. Refugees tote rotisserie chickens from a takeout joint on the main street, called the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.This is all black market. Smugglers traffic in camp vouchers and goods, undermining legitimate Jordanian businesses, profiting criminal gangs in and out of the camp. An empty police station disappeared from near the camp entrance one night, its trailers repurposed as homes and shops two days later.At a bridal shop here the other morning, the owner, Abdullah Harriri, said he had paid 7,000 Jordanian dinars, roughly $10,000, for his property at a prime location on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es \u2014 another underground transaction. \u201cBy the end of the year I should be able to sell this property for 10,000 or 12,000\u201d dinars, he calculated. A shadow real estate market is a sign of permanence.Zaatari\u2019s transformation happened after Mr. Kleinschmidt started talking with, and thereby neutralizing, the Mafia-like groups that had seized control of the camp. At the same time he worked to enlist allies among refugees, encouraging grass-roots initiatives, listening. In effect, he started treating Zaatari not like a camp but like a city. \u201cWe design refugee camps; refugees build cities,\u201d he said.Refugees at Zaatari steal the electricity that powers their shops and washing machines to the tune of $750,000 a month, an unsustainable burden for the United Nations. Mr. Kleinschmidt persuaded shop owners to install circuit breakers so the system would not collapse, and he is now working on a plan to institute monthly fees for shop owners and refugees with washing machines, eventually doing the same with sewage and water \u2014 in effect, slowly formalizing the camp\u2019s economy, an approach both fair and politically savvy. Jordan receives $1 million a day in international aid, and some Jordanians, including landlords, banks and small businesses, benefit from the Syrian influx. But poor Jordanians, who pay for their utilities, complain that Syrians steal jobs, drive up rents, overcrowd schools and drain resources.Those complaints partly explain Azraq, which seems above all conceived to prevent Syrians from escaping or tapping into public utilities. If it grows as predicted, it will no doubt succumb anyway to the inevitable urbanizing forces that are changing Zaatari, which will be occupied for years to come, if not by Syrians than by Jordanians. Installing a permanent municipal water system there would cost what the United Nations now spends every year trucking water to the camp, and it would be an investment in long-term development.Mr. Kleinschmidt, pushing this philosophy, is talking with, among others, representatives from Google about wiring the camp and with the urban planning office in Amsterdam, which recently offered 10,000 bicycles to the camp, an idea that prompted a few canny Syrian refugees to open bike repair shops even before the bikes arrived.That sort of enterprise should serve the Jordanian economy. A sign that Jordanian officials may be coming around to this long-term thinking is a recent promise by the Ministry of Environment to deliver several thousand trees to the camp.They would make life better for the Awad family, among the newest arrivals at Zaatari, nine of them, including six small children, sick from the flies and dysentery, crammed into windblown tents at the far end of the camp. Grateful to have left the bloodshed, they struggle to survive and dream about living like Rasheed Abdul Latif Rashed and his wife, Amal Zaubi, on the opposite end of Zaatari. That couple sold the family\u2019s gold jewelry to buy a complex of trailers not far from the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\u201cWe were used to living a decent life back home, so we had to make something of our situation here,\u201d Mr. Abdul Latif explained, standing in the trailer that has become their living room, near a burbling aquarium and a martyr\u2019s shrine to their only child, a son killed in Syria.\u201cYou have to look ahead,\u201d he said, as did Mr. Bidawi, the barbershop owner who lost a daughter.Things are looking up for Mr. Bidawi and his wife.She is pregnant again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Britain-China Summit, a New Paradigm of Power", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeLONDON \u2014 Before the Chinese prime minister came to Britain to sign billions of pounds\u2019 worth of business contracts last month, a brief diplomatic spat erupted. The planned length of the red carpet rolled out for Li Keqiang at Heathrow Airport fell short of the plane by about 10 feet, his aides complained. Could this be fixed?It was a meeting of an emerging great power with a former great power. But it was also a meeting of great insecurities.China, which by some estimates will become the No. 1 economy in the world this year, still seeks validation in protocol, in this case from the onetime colonial power that humiliated it with opium wars and gunboat diplomacy. Britain, with an indebted state and an economy that has still not fully recovered, needs the investment.Incensed at the leaks about China\u2019s requests in the British press (\u201cChina sees Red,\u201d was The Daily Mail\u2019s triple pun), a newspaper controlled by China\u2019s Communist Party, Global Times, swiftly hit back, calling Britain an \u201cold, declining empire\u201d that engaged in \u201ceccentric acts\u201d to hide its fading importance.Even Britain\u2019s military, traditionally celebrated as one of the more serious defense structures on this side of the Atlantic, is getting a hard time, and not just because of the still-raging controversy over the decision to stand by the United States in invading Iraq in 2003. \u201cBritish troops too fat to fight,\u201d The Times of London claimed on a recent front page.The only hope for bolstering the national mood this summer is Andy Murray, Britain\u2019s highest-seeded tennis player, who is currently battling it out at Wimbledon.Mr. Murray is from Scotland, of course, and might not be British for that much longer. The idea of Scotland\u2019s departure came up on the sidelines of the China-Britain summit meeting last month, as a member of the Chinese delegation tried to get his head around the Scottish referendum. With Taiwan or perhaps Tibet on his mind, he asked what Westminster would \u201cdo\u201d if the Scots actually voted to secede.\u201cWe would let them secede,\u201d came the British answer.For all the soul-searching about the state of affairs in Britain, it is an answer that everyone here takes for granted and is rooted in a commitment to freedom, human rights and self-determination that remains largely alien to China.Mr. Cameron irked Chinese officials in 2012 by meeting the Dalai Lama, Tibet\u2019s spiritual leader. Still, at a joint news conference with Mr. Li, Mr. Cameron chose not to bring up the thorny issue of human rights in China. Instead, it appeared to be Britain\u2019s turn to seek validation. Which country mattered the most to China, a British reporter asked \u2014 Britain, France or Germany? There followed a long, noncommittal response from Mr. Li and eventually a cryptic conclusion: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a local place,\u201d he said, \u201cyou sing local songs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Against E.P.A. Rule on Carbon Pollution Would Gain, Study Finds", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma are among the most vocal Republican skeptics of the science that burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming, but a new study to be released Thursday found that their states would be among the biggest economic winners under a regulation proposed by President Obama to fight climate change.The report concluded that the rule would hurt states where coal production is a central part of the economy \u2014 chiefly Wyoming, the nation\u2019s largest coal producer. States that produce both coal and natural gas, such as Pennsylvania, would experience an economic trade-off as diminished coal production was replaced by new natural gas production. The regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency assigns states different targets for cutting planet-warming carbon pollution from power plants and requires them to devise individual compliance plans to meet the standards. Experts say the regulation could transform the nation\u2019s power system by shuttering coal plants, driving new wind and solar power, and spurring states to enact taxes on carbon pollution. The study took into account the economic costs imposed by the regulation and concluded that it would raise electricity rates by up to 10 percent in some parts of the country and eventually freeze coal production. But even taking those costs into account, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas together would experience an annual net economic benefit of up to about $16 billion, according to the study.\u201cThe irony is that some of the states that have been the loudest in opposing E.P.A. climate regulations have the most to gain in terms of actual economic interest,\u201d said Trevor Houser, an analyst at the Rhodium Group and a co-author of the study.The report analyzed the economic impact of the rule on 11 regions of the country and found that Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas would collectively have to make the steepest pollution cuts, per capita, in the nation.Texas\u2019 reduction alone would account for 19 percent of the nation\u2019s total emission reductions from power plants. But even as the states made those steep cuts, the report found that, over all, their economies would benefit, although at the expense of coal-dependent states.\u201cIt\u2019s a significant net gain for natural gas-producing states but exacerbates the loss for coal-producing states,\u201d Mr. Houser said. \u201cBut more and more states are producing natural gas.\u201d The gain for Texas would come at the direct expense of coal-producing Wyoming, Mr. Houser said. While Texas currently buys coal from Wyoming and burns it for electricity, it would be able to comply with the new rule by ceasing to buy that coal and instead producing and burning more low-carbon natural gas within the state.In his book \u201cFed Up,\u201d Mr. Perry dismissed climate change as a \u201ccontrived phony mess that is falling apart.\u201d In a May letter to Mr. Obama, he wrote, \u201cMr. President, your words promise an energy renaissance while your policies are strangling the energy industry.\u201d Mr. Perry\u2019s office declined to comment on the study, which was to be released Thursday morning.Mr. Inhofe, who has called climate change at the hands of humans a hoax, did not question the study\u2019s findings and agreed that, in the short term, his state\u2019s economy was likely to benefit from the E.P.A.\u2019s proposed rule. But he said that the uneven impact of the rule nationally \u2014 a lift to natural gas-producing states but a hit to coal-producing states \u2014 would also be felt in Oklahoma. For example, he said, there are plans to build a new coal mine north of Poteau, Okla. \u201cIt\u2019s a very significant part of a somewhat poor part of the state,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthey would be devastated\u201d if the regulation were enacted.At a hearing of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on Wednesday, Mr. Inhofe signaled that he intended to fight the plan. He asked Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the E.P.A., who was testifying about the climate change regulation, \u201cSay a state like Oklahoma does not develop a plan?\u201dThat is what the Obama administration fears: that Republican governors, like Mary Fallin in Oklahoma, will defy the agency by refusing to submit climate change plans. Mr. Perry has defied previous federal clean air regulations by refusing to submit plans for Texas.In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Hal Quinn, the president of the National Mining Association, a lobbying group, called the proposed rule \u201ca stunning attempt to completely transform how we generate, transmit and use electricity.\u201d He added, \u201cAmericans need E.P.A. to give them a break before it breaks the electric grid and the American economy along with it.\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the chamber\u2019s Republican leader, is already planning legislation to block the rule. For now, any effort in Congress to stop it or roll it back would fail in the Democratic-majority Senate, but that will change if Republicans win a majority in the chamber in the midterm elections this fall.Mr. McConnell, whose state is one of the nation\u2019s largest producers of coal, sees blocking the climate rule as a top agenda item if the Republicans gain control of the Senate next year.

{"Headline": "Next Gold Rush: Legal Marijuana Feeds Entrepreneurs\u2019 Dreams", "Date": "2014-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 Like the glint of gold or rumors of oil in ages past, the advent of legal, recreational marijuana is beginning to reshape economies in Colorado and Washington State. Marijuana is beckoning thousands of entrepreneurs and workers, investors and hucksters from across the country, each looking to cash in on a rapidly changing industry that offers hefty portions of both promise and peril.At convention centers and in hotel meeting rooms, start-up companies are floating sales pitches for marijuana delivery services or apps to name-tagged investors who sip red wine and munch on hempseed snacks. This year, hundreds of people seeking jobs lined up for blocks in downtown Denver, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in hand, for an industry-sponsored marijuana job fair. Some have traveled far, leaving security jobs in Ohio or software jobs in Indiana to move for marijuana, hoping the industry has room for them.\u201cIt\u2019s the wild, wild West,\u201d said Tom Bollich, who moved from the world of mobile apps in Silicon Valley to become the chief executive of a company based in Boulder, Colo., that builds climate systems for marijuana growers.Investors in marijuana say there have been as many as 80 marijuana-related companies trading publicly, though federal securities regulators have suspended trading in five of them over the last few months and have warned that some of these new firms might be fraudulent efforts to dupe investors hunting for the next big thing.In Colorado\u2019s first six months of retail sales, the number of people licensed to work with the plant has grown to 11,289 this month \u2014 slightly less than the number of auto mechanics in the state \u2014 from about 6,000. (The state points out that not all those people may be actively working in the marijuana industry.) Since the first dozen stores opened in January, Colorado has issued licenses for more than 200 recreational marijuana shops.Tourists have flocked to those stores, making up 44 percent of the customers at one Denver shop during a sample week this spring, according to the state\u2019s first study of demand for marijuana. Tour companies and marijuana-friendly bed-and-breakfasts have sprung up to serve tourists, too.But many have also discovered that selling marijuana, even without the specter of being arrested, carries high costs and no guarantee of success.A heavily regulated recreational marijuana program in Washington drew more than 7,000 applications, but many of those would-be growers, processors and retailers have struggled from the start. They had to find financial capital that state inspectors would approve and lock in a legal business location. Then, they had to endure months of delays as overwhelmed state workers processed and analyzed an oversubscribed applicant list.\u201cI\u2019m about fed up,\u201d said Michael McDonald, a 57-year-old home-repair contractor, who has applied for two licenses to grow and process marijuana in Bellingham, in northwestern Washington.Mr. McDonald said the deck was stacked in favor of richer corporate players. With banks still so leery of lending in the industry, he said, financing choices for smaller entrepreneurs like him are few.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that the only people who are really going to get licenses are the ones who have somehow hidden their illegal money, or legitimized it, or it\u2019s big business backing it, and that\u2019s not how it was supposed to be,\u201d Mr. McDonald said.Aaron Varney, 38, who directs a nonprofit medical marijuana cooperative in Seattle, got a 24th-place slot in the state lottery for the 21 retail marijuana locations up for grabs in his city; three people ahead of him would have to wash out of the process for his number to come up. He wants the industry to succeed, he said, but cannot fully silence what he called the selfish voice inside that hopes to get in.\u201cReal close, but not quite there,\u201d Mr. Varney said of his waiting game.Despite marijuana\u2019s outlaw reputation and legal status, the industry is growing largely because the Obama administration decided last year not to oppose votes in 2012 in Colorado and Washington that legalized marijuana for personal use and laid the groundwork for statewide sales. But regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission warned that the loosened laws created new horizons for fraud, as small companies with dubious assets and financial disclosures leapt into the over-the-counter trading market.\u201cNinety percent are either scams or aren\u2019t going to make it,\u201d said Alan Brochstein, a financial analyst who is carving out a niche in the cannabis market.But many are ready to gamble on marijuana\u2019s success. After a decade in the military and a career working in security, Sy Alli, 53, moved to Colorado to become the director of corporate security for Dixie Brands, a company that makes marijuana-infused drinks and snacks. Zach Marburger, 28, visited in January to ski and check out the early days of legal use of recreational marijuana, and decided to relocate to Denver to develop software to connect customers and retailers.And a few months ago, a 22-year-old mobile app developer named Isaac Dietrich and a friend were smoking marijuana in a Norfolk, Va., apartment when they realized: There could be money in this. They moved to Colorado, where they are working on an app called MassRoots, which lets marijuana enthusiasts privately post photos on an online platform out of sight of their parents or co-workers. They want it to be the Instagram for marijuana users.\u201cWe thought about relocating to Silicon Valley, but they haven\u2019t backed a single marijuana company,\u201d Mr. Dietrich said. \u201cThis is where everything\u2019s happening. We didn\u2019t want to be left out.\u201dJack Healy reported from Denver, and Kirk Johnson from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stuck in Visa Debate, U.S. Risks Losing Researchers", "Date": "2014-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, United States policy makers have been debating the idea of granting green cards to foreigners with science doctorates. The cell biologist Xiao-Wei Chen, at the University of Michigan, is no longer waiting for them to decide.Mr. Chen, whose work on cholesterol metabolism helped him win a job competition this year at the National Institutes of Health, is instead making plans to return home to China and his undergraduate institution, Peking University.\u201cThe opportunities there might be more nourishing for young people like me to develop scientifically,\u201d he said.Mr. Chen remains in a minority. Most top-ranked Chinese students offered jobs at American institutions after finishing doctorates still choose to stay. \u201cHe\u2019s more the exception than the rule,\u201d said Denis F. Simon, a professor of politics and global studies at Arizona State University who specializes in China policy.Yet Mr. Chen might also be a warning flag: As Congress debates whether to extend green-card privileges to foreign students earning doctorates in the sciences, the question may be growing moot. Top-ranking students are already finding that they can stay if they want \u2014 and many do not. The nation\u2019s continuing disinvestment in science is making overseas options appear increasingly attractive.\u201cAnybody in academe knows,\u201d says Michael S. Teitelbaum, a Harvard University expert in the global competition for scientific talent, \u201cthe offers coming from Chinese institutions are getting more and more attractive.\u201dAs the world grows more interconnected, says Mr. Simon, distance from the United States becomes less of an impediment to career success.Mr. Chen\u2019s case gained attention in April during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing with the heads of the major federal science agencies.The event was a call for helping the economy by investing more federal money in scientific research. Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, took the opportunity to bemoan the loss of many accomplished Asian students. \u201cWhat a waste, that we would bring this talent to America, train it, and then invite it to leave,\u201d he commented.A bill Mr. Durbin has been promoting, backed by the Obama administration and leading lawmakers from both parties, would grant a green card, or permanent legal residency, to any foreigner who earned a doctorate in a science or engineering field at an American university and received a job offer based on it.The director of the National Institutes of Health, Francis S. Collins, responded to Mr. Durbin by telling him about Mr. Chen and the multimillion-dollar package he was offered by Peking University, and how China\u2019s approach to pursuing research compared with the prolonged period of budgetary stress facing scientists in the United States.\u201cCertainly the visa situation is a big part of the issue, and it would be great to get that fixed,\u201d Dr. Collins told the senator. \u201cBut even if that\u2019s fixed, then people don\u2019t see that there\u2019s a future for them by staying in the American medical system \u2014 and it looks much brighter in Singapore or China or South Korea or Brazil \u2014 then they\u2019re going to go where the opportunities are.\u201dSome in Congress are concerned about declining federal support for science \u2014 the National Institutes\u2019s budget is about 25 percent smaller than it was 10 years ago, in inflation-adjusted dollars.\u201cChina is about to eat our lunch,\u201d Rep. Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, told a staff briefing last month on Capitol Hill.Speaking from Ann Arbor, Mich., Mr. Chen reiterated Dr. Collins\u2019s point about economics being more important than visa rules. Even without the green-card legislation, versions of which have been pursued unsuccessfully in Congress for years, Mr. Chen said he had seen that most top-ranked foreign science graduates who really wanted to stay in the United States managed to find a way.While a green-card bill may help foreign science graduates ranked at middle and lower performance levels, those recognized as star performers are eligible for visas, based on certain high-demand skills. \u201cA visa is definitely not too much of a problem for many good people,\u201d Mr. Chen said.Two of the most high-profile losses of foreign scientific talent in recent years \u2014 Shi Yigong, a Princeton University biology professor who left for Tsinghua University, and Rao Yi, a Northwestern University neurobiologist who decamped to Peking University \u2014 even had United States citizenship and gave it up.Those cases, and that of Mr. Chen, suggest that foreign scientists consider factors more varied than may be assumed in many policy debates.Mr. Chen earned an undergraduate degree from Peking University in 2002 and went to Michigan, where he earned a doctorate in physiology in 2008. This year he was among a handful of winners chosen from several hundred applicants for the Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigators program at the National Institutes of Health.But the actual appointment of a Stadtman winner to an N.I.H. division is dependent on annual budget allocations, and Mr. Chen was told that he would probably need to wait another year or more to get a posting. Instead he accepted the offer from Peking University, which included modern lab facilities, a supply of graduate students, and \u2014 most important, he says \u2014 confidence that his budget would remain robust for many years to come.Rather than hold out the prospect of a visa that becomes an increasingly less valuable enticement for top foreign scientists, United States policy makers might instead consider reviving federal support for research and making conditions easier for American scientists to collaborate with global partners, said Mr. Simon, of Arizona State.Still, the relatively few top science graduates who return home to foreign countries should not be regarded by Americans as somehow \u201clost\u201d or \u201cwasted\u201d investments, he added. \u201cThe interesting question is not whether one stays or goes,\u201d he says, \u201cbut what one does wherever they are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its first-person narrator is Roxy Walston, the 20-year-old wife of a tobacco farmer and the mother of their 2-year-old child. Restless and unfulfilled, Roxy is, in her own words, \u201cunstrung, unquieted, my heart like a grape stain with no wine made.\u201dWhen the hired hand Jack Ruffin arrives on the farm \u201cas wiry and tight as a coiled bedspring,\u201d he and Roxy begin a fevered affair; their liaison sets in motion a chain of events that culminates in a horrific act of violence. At story\u2019s end, however, Roxy has attained the self-possession to begin to reclaim her life.The novella\u2019s publication precipitated what The Washington Post, in a 1983 profile of Ms. Shivers, called \u201cone of the strangest success stories in American letters.\u201dReviewing the book in The Post, Jonathan Yardley wrote, \u201cIt certainly is difficult to escape the conclusion that we have here the makings of a late-blooming Flannery O\u2019Connor.\u201d He added, \u201c\u00a0\u2018Here to Get My Baby Out of Jail\u2019 is a breathtakingly accomplished piece of work that in no way betrays its author\u2019s inexperience.\u201dCritics marveled at the economy with which Ms. Shivers was able to conjure a time, place and social milieu: The entire book spanned 136 pages.Ms. Shivers\u2019s only other novella, \u201cA Whistling Woman,\u201d published in 1993, also drew critical praise. Set in post-Civil War North Carolina and suffused with the folkloric timbre of ghost stories, it centers on a woman who yearns to forsake her staid husband for the dashing man who raped her years earlier.The success of Ms. Shivers\u2019s books, and her long career as a teacher of writing \u2014 she was for many years a writer in residence at what is now Georgia Regents University in Augusta, Ga. \u2014 is all the more noteworthy in that she did not begin writing in earnest until she was in her 40s. Even after that, she said, she did not conceive of herself as an author.\u201cI\u2019m still just stunned,\u201d Ms. Shivers told The Washington Post in 1983, several months after \u201cHere to Get My Baby Out of Jail\u201d was published. \u201cAlmost nobody believes me, but I didn\u2019t write the book thinking I was gonna get it published.\u201dOne of 10 children of a funeral director, Julia Louise Shingleton was born on Aug. 15, 1929, in Stantonsburg, a tobacco-farming town in eastern North Carolina, and reared nearby in Wilson. She studied briefly at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson and at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C., but left before graduating to marry Quentin Shivers.Before long, Ms. Shivers was living in Augusta with her husband and their three young children; during those years she worked in the record department of the local Sears. In the late 1960s, at her children\u2019s urging, she enrolled in a local creative writing class.In the early \u201970s, Ms. Shivers began work on what would become \u201cHere to Get My Baby Out of Jail.\u201d In 1979 she entered the manuscript \u2014 then written in the third person \u2014 in a literary competition in Augusta. Her only ambition, she later said, was to snare the $50 first prize.The competition was judged by the novelist Mary Gordon, and Ms. Gordon found much to admire in Ms. Shivers\u2019s manuscript. She sent it to her own literary agent, who submitted to an editor at Random house. If Ms. Shivers would consider rewriting the novel in the first person, the editor said, Random House would give it serious consideration.\u201cThat was back when Jimmy Carter was president,\u201d Ms. Shivers told The Post in 1983. \u201cAnd I kept thinking, \u2018Ooh, it\u2019s gonna sound like just Amy Carter asking her daddy about something,\u2019\u00a0\u201d But she complied.Besides her daughter Ms. Siciliano, Ms. Shivers is survived by her husband, whom she married in 1949; another daughter, Sherrill Cook; a son, Mark; three brothers, Hugh, Roddy and Foy Shingleton; and two grandchildren.A resident of Augusta, Ms. Shivers also wrote \u201cMy Shining Hour,\u201d a memoir of growing up in the South during World War II. It was issued last year by Dash Press, a small independent publisher in Georgia.During the years she worked on \u201cHere to Get My Baby Out of Jail,\u201d Ms. Shivers had to contend with the incredulity of friends who were even more hard-pressed to imagine her as a novelist than she was herself.\u201cI\u2019d tell them, \u2018I really am a writer,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Shivers said in the profile in The Post. \u201cStill, most of the people I was around said, \u2018Well, it must be a cookbook or a romance.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pendulum Takes a Swing Toward Value Stocks", "Date": "2014-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMutual funds that focus on large-cap value stocks returned 7 percent, on average, in the first half of the year; those concentrating on midcap value stocks returned 7.8 percent, according to Morningstar. Large-cap growth funds had gains of 4.7 percent, while midcap growth funds were up 4 percent. Small-cap growth funds were hit hard this spring but recovered some momentum in June, and ended up 0.9 percent, on average, for the first six months. But small-cap value funds gained 4.7 percent. Brian Belski, chief strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said the run on value stocks was not likely to end soon, in part because he expected the economy to improve and to bolster corporate earnings. \u201cWhen corporate earnings growth is expanding, it\u2019s positive for value,\u201d he said.BMO screens for value stocks using several criteria. It seeks companies that haven\u2019t had an earnings loss in the previous two years, and those that have less debt than equity and have price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios lower than those of the overall Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Among large-cap stocks that clear these screens are Norfolk Southern, UnitedHealth Group, Target and Principal Financial Group. Mr. Belski specifically cites the financial sector as having \u201ca lot of long-term value.\u201dThe Valley Forge fund holds shares and warrants of Bank of America, which has faced problems stemming from the mortgage crisis. Despite that, \u201cthey have tremendous core earnings capacity,\u201d he said. B. of A. can earn $2 a share beginning in 2018, he estimated, versus 75 cents a share in the trailing 12 months through March 2014. At less than $16 on June 30, its shares traded at less than eight times what he called \u201cnormalized\u201d earnings. Hillshire Brands is a value bet that has already paid off for his fund. When it bought shares in the first quarter, Mr. Kaufler said, the company was underappreciated. \u201cIt was trading at a discount to its private market value,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was at least a 20 percent discount.\u201d With Pilgrim\u2019s Pride and Tyson Foods making buyout bids for the company, Hillshire shares climbed to just over $62 at the end of the quarter from a mid-May price of around $36.He cited the energy sector, which typically falls under the value umbrella. Many oil and gas drillers, using fracking technologies, have strong growth potential, and the market has rewarded them with premium prices, making them growth stocks. But Mr. Jacobsen said some service and engineering companies that support the shale drillers were still selling as cheaply priced value stocks. He also said he thought worries over Chinese economic growth had excessively punished some Asian companies. He cited South Korean semiconductor companies as growth stocks that had been marked down and were \u201cvery attractive.\u201dNet margins for the top 200 companies in the S.&P. 500 were 9.9 percent, on average, in the first quarter, far above the 50-year average of 4.5 percent. Is this superior performance sustainable? Mr. Swanson says he thinks it will be, at least for a while. Low interest rates and relatively low corporate tax payments have contributed to margin expansion, he said, and this should be sustained. And the low price of natural gas has aided many manufacturers. He also noted fundamental structural factors that were unlikely to disappear overnight. Workers, for example, are likely to continue to fall short in sharing gains of the economic recovery. \u201cThe labor component of the economy is not getting its share of G.D.P.,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good for the owners of capital.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Recovery? Home Building Took a Dive in June", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Sector in the DoldrumsRemember when 2014 was going to be the year home building finally got out of the doldrums and accelerated back toward health \u2014 or at least to filling something closer to its usual role supporting growth? Yeah, never mind.That\u2019s right, another disappointing reading on the housing market was released Thursday morning. The number of housing units that builders started work on fell 9.3 percent in June, to an 893,000 annual rate. The number of housing permits issued by local governments, a forward-looking measure that government statisticians consider less prone to measurement error, fell 4.2 percent. Forecasters had expected both numbers to rise.What makes the June results curious \u2014 and particularly disappointing \u2014 is that some of the excuses heard for weak housing numbers don\u2019t hold water any more.The unusually bad winter weather that slowed construction in January and February is now long past. If anything, you might expect a catch-up effect from projects delayed then to be a bit of a tailwind for housing this summer.Mortgage rates spiked in the second half of 2013, perhaps leading builders to exercise a greater note of caution as they weighed new projects. But rates have fallen more or less steadily through the first half of 2014. The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.5 percent at the start of the year, according to Freddie Mac, but was 4.1 percent at the end of May, as builders were starting to plan how many houses to begin building in June.It\u2019s not that the report was uniformly negative. Permits issued for single-family homes, as opposed to apartment buildings with many units, actually rose a bit, from a 615,000 annual rate to 631,000. The decline was concentrated in permits issued for homes in projects with more than five units, which have been a mainstay of construction activity in recent years.And the decline in housing starts was entirely concentrated in the Southern states, the region that by the census\u2019s definition stretches from Delaware to Texas. Housing starts actually increased in each of the other three census regions, but fell by a 158,000 annual rate in the South. That could be an aberration, but it bears watching in future months.Regardless, the basic lesson to be learned from the latest housing numbers is a simple one: The housing recovery is, at best, weak. And it may not be much of a recovery at all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Duel for California Governor Spans Nation", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Gov. Jerry Brown has a little-known Republican challenger campaigning against him across California, taunting him on issues from taxes to transit. But his most formidable Republican adversary is turning out to be a fellow Californian who wields his power from an office 2,700 miles away: Representative Kevin McCarthy, the incoming House majority leader.Within days of being elected majority leader, to replace Eric Cantor after his surprise loss in a Republican primary, Mr. McCarthy escalated his long-held opposition to Mr. Brown\u2019s signature project, a 520-mile, $68 billion high-speed train that would run from San Francisco to Los Angeles, vowing to do what he could to kill it. \u201cIf Sacramento looks to Washington to pay for the train, that will never happen,\u201d he said in an interview last week.Further, Mr. McCarthy said he would push Republican legislation responding to the severe drought here \u2014 which he called the \u201ccrisis of the century in California\u201d \u2014 by, among other things, rolling back federal environmental protections for endangered smelt and salmon populations, which farmers complained cost them water for irrigation. Mr. Brown denounced the bill as \u201can unwelcome and divisive intrusion into California\u2019s efforts to manage this severe crisis.\u201dIn the course of an interview, conducted by telephone during his weekly visit to his district, Mr. McCarthy offered strong criticism of Democratic policies and Mr. Brown\u2019s leadership style.\u201cThere are some tough challenges in California, and the governor\u2019s answer is always to raise more taxes,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to harm the economy.\u201d\u201cGovernors from other states come here to get jobs to leave California,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t hear of our governor going to other states to attract their jobs here.\u201dMr. Brown declined to comment on Mr. McCarthy or his views. \u201cThat is not something I wish to speak about,\u201d he said, walking away after delivering a speech to a conference on solar power here. Aides said he saw no gain in getting involved in any kind of tit-for-tat exchange with Mr. McCarthy.State Senator Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a Democrat and the president-elect of the State Senate, said Mr. McCarthy, for all his new power, still faced a popular governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.\u201cThe most powerful, the most influential person in the nation, with regards to California, is Gov. Jerry Brown,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said.Still, for Republicans who have felt marginalized in California, the sight of Mr. McCarthy charging up the hill is a tonic. Few people in either party think Mr. Brown\u2019s Republican challenger, Neel Kashkari, has much of a chance.\u201cThere needs to be an effective argument against many of Brown\u2019s policies, and Kevin is ideally suited to make them,\u201d said Representative Tom McClintock, a California Republican. \u201cHe has a vivid understanding of California public policy. He will be a welcome counterbalance to the policies of Jerry Brown.\u201dRepresentative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who served with Mr. McCarthy in the Assembly, praised him as a strong voice countering \u201cthose regulatory policies coming out of California.\u201d\u201cWhere there is a clear difference between them on priorities, I expect them to have a very strong debate,\u201d Mr. Denham said. \u201cHe is going to be very vocal and forceful.\u201dIt is not unusual for Washington lawmakers to take an interest in affairs back home, but few match Mr. McCarthy\u2019s fascination in the details of issues confronting his state and party.Mr. McCarthy, 49, elected to Congress in 2006, is moving into a vacuum caused by the precipitous decline of his party here. \u201cThe Republican Party has a long way to go,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have some great opportunities.\u201dFor Mr. McCarthy, there are risks, starting with the complications of navigating the often-conflicting views of Republicans in Washington and Republicans back home on issues such as immigration. Well aware of the lessons of Mr. Cantor\u2019s loss, he made a point of saying that his first priority was responding to sentiments of his constituents.\u201cThe question is, how far down the road does he want to go to become the anti-Democrat in California?\u201d said Raphael J. Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University. \u201cGovernor Brown in California is not the cartoon character that Republicans have made Obama in Washington.\u201dAnd Democrats said that as long as Mr. Brown remained strongly for the rail project, there was only so much Mr. McCarthy could do. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he is in a position to block the train,\u201d said Representative Karen Bass, a Democrat from California who served with Mr. McCarthy in the Assembly.Mr. McCarthy said Mr. Brown brings up the train whenever they meet. \u201cEvery time he comes back, the facts get stronger on my side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe governor should focus his time on water, infrastructure, highways.\u201dFor all that, Ms. Bass said she thought California would, on balance, benefit from having two people in House leadership positions; the other is his liberal counterpoint, Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader. And as Mr. McCarthy rises, some Democrats said, a critical question will be how he manages the competing political imperatives in his life.\u201cHis leadership in the House puts him in a position to help California or hurt California,\u201d Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat, said. \u201cI hope he uses his position to help our state rather than hurt us.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the political relationship between Gov. Jerry Brown of California and Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, misstated, in some editions, the year Mr. McCarthy was elected to Congress from California.

{"Headline": "The Fed\u2019s Bully Pulpit on Wall Street", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 EIGHTEEN years ago, when Alan Greenspan wanted to send a message that he was worried that the stock market was getting a little bubbly, he did it with a typically inscrutable phrasing buried in an otherwise unremarkable speech.In 1996, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, mused about how the Fed would know \u201cwhen irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions.\u201d The next morning the stock market sold off ferociously on the mere hint of his concern.How things change.Mr. Greenspan\u2019s comments were vague and subject to varying interpretation, and even then they prompted hand-wringing over whether it made sense for the nation\u2019s top economist to tell the financial markets that prices might have risen too high. Contrast Mr. Greenspan\u2019s comments with those Tuesday and Wednesday by the woman who now holds that same job. Janet L. Yellen deployed the bully pulpit of the Federal Reserve leadership to send a message on market prices.Ms. Yellen specifically called out the valuations of leveraged loans (which fund corporate buyouts) and high-yield \u201cjunk\u201d bonds (which fund companies viewed as having risky finances) as potentially excessive. She acknowledged that prices for a wide range of assets, including stocks, bonds and real estate, had risen, but argued that they \u201cremain generally in line with historic norms.\u201dA written report accompanying Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony went further, pointing to \u201csubstantially stretched\u201d valuations of social media and biotechnology stocks. An index of social media stock prices fell.These events raise interesting questions: Should government officials speak up when they think markets have gotten prices wrong? At what point does the Fed leader go from being the nation\u2019s economist in chief to the market strategist in chief? And should investors listen to Ms. Yellen\u2019s views?Here is the predicament that Ms. Yellen and other top policy makers face. The last two recessions in the United States have been caused by the popping of asset bubbles, first the stock market in 2000, then housing in 2007.The mission Congress assigned the Fed is to look after the real economy \u2014 maximum employment and stable prices, to be precise. But all of their policy tools work through the financial system. They are trying to maintain low unemployment and low inflation, but they do that almost exclusively by buying and selling bonds.That means that their policies often have a more significant impact (and certainly a more immediate and measurable one) on the price of, say, junk bonds than they do on job creation and wages.That is always true, but it has never been more true than lately, with the Fed deeply engaged in unconventional steps to try to increase economic growth, leading to nearly $4.5 trillion in assets ending up on the central bank\u2019s balance sheet.To some degree, the whole point of that exercise was to drive up the prices of stocks and other assets to encourage economic growth. But a major risk all along has been that the efforts would raise asset values to bubble territory without accompanying economic growth.If you believe that is happening, there are two options. One, embodied in a speech at the University of Southern California on Wednesday by the president of the Dallas Fed, Richard W. Fisher, is to pull back on money printing. But if you believe that the Fed needs to keep doing everything it possibly can to get stronger growth, then you are left with a few other options. One, which Ms. Yellen has repeatedly emphasized, is regulating banks and other financial institutions well to ensure that even if a bubble does emerge, and pop, the rest of the economy does not go down with it. There is no reason that somebody paying too much for junk bonds or social media stocks now needs to cause a recession in 2016, in other words.Another option is to use \u201copen mouth policy\u201d (as opposed to the usual \u201copen market policy\u201d), jawboning markets to try to rein in excesses that might create risks. It is not an outlandish idea. The economist Dean Baker has argued that if Mr. Greenspan had made full-throated, public arguments that there was a housing bubble in 2004 and 2005, it might have led to fewer people stretching to buy homes and less damage when the bubble eventually popped.But it does amount to a government official substituting her own judgment for that of the marketplace, the prices arrived at by thousands of buyers and sellers for an app maker or a leveraged loan.For a sense of the risks there, consider this: Mr. Greenspan\u2019s warning of irrational exuberance in the stock market was in December 1996. The worst excesses of the dot-com bubble occurred years later; even at the low point of the post-dot-com stock crash and the financial crisis of 2008, prices never again fell that far. A person who ignored Mr. Greenspan\u2019s advice and bought into the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index the morning after his speech has earned a 268 percent return since then (including reinvested dividends).As Ms. Yellen may learn, the challenge of telling people when the prices are right is that you might just be wrong.The Upshot: The Upshot presents news, analysis\nand graphics about politics\nand policy.Advertisement"}

But they love Ms. Warren (even if they are not sure she can).On Friday, as Ms. Warren made the rounds of Detroit \u2014 with a morning keynote address at the Netroots gathering, a midday fund-raiser for Representative Gary Peters, Michigan\u2019s Democratic Senate nominee, and an afternoon book-signing \u2014 they let the love flow.\u201cRun, Liz, run!\u201d the crowd chanted as the senator took the stage for her morning talk. Ms. Warren tried to shush them, waving her arms and admonishing them like the teacher she once was: \u201cSit down, people. Come on, let\u2019s get started.\u201d Then she opened with the sort of blistering populist assault on corporations, Republicans, banks, lobbyists and trade deals that has become her trademark.\u201cThey cheated American families, crashed the economy, got bailed out, and now the biggest banks are even bigger than they were when they got too big to fail in 2008!\u201d Ms. Warren thundered, in one of her many applause lines. \u201cA kid gets caught with a few ounces of pot and goes to jail, but a big bank launders drug money and no one gets arrested. The game is rigged!\u201dShe went on: \u201cBillionaires pay taxes at lower rates than their secretaries. How does this happen? It happens because they all have lobbyists. Lobbyist and Republican friends in Congress. Lobbyists and Republicans to protect every loophole and every privilege. The game is rigged, and it isn\u2019t right!\u201dThe Netroots conference, the nation\u2019s largest gathering of liberal activists and organizers, is a natural base for Ms. Warren, whose message about economic inequality \u2014 in particular the burdens of student debt \u2014 resonates with this largely young, tech-savvy crowd.Dozens lined up to get signed copies of her new book, \u201cA Fighting Chance.\u201d (Some said they had no interest in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s recent memoir, \u201cHard Choices.\u201d \u201cWho wrote that?\u201d one man asked.)\u201cI got a little verklempt,\u201d gushed Daniel Pino, a gay rights advocate, after Ms. Warren gave him a peck on the cheek.Even at the fund-raiser for Mr. Peters, held apart from the conference in a downtown hotel, Democrats swooned over the senator, who has become a popular surrogate on the 2014 Democratic campaign circuit, even in Republican strongholds like Kentucky and West Virginia. After warning donors that \u201cGary is up against a right-wing Republican agenda,\u201d Ms. Warren posed patiently for pictures.\u201cI want to bottle her and take her everywhere,\u201d said Debbie Dingell, who is running for the House seat being vacated by her husband, John, who is retiring.At the Netroots conference, a nascent group calling itself Ready for Warren \u2014 an obvious takeoff on Ready for Hillary, the political action committee devoted to supporting a Clinton White House bid in 2016 \u2014 was behind the hat and bumper sticker effort. It is not yet an official organization.\u201cWe are just getting focused on tapping into the grass-roots momentum,\u201d said Erica Sagrans, the group\u2019s spokeswoman, who worked for President Obama\u2019s campaign in 2012.People here were all too happy to take the hats and the bumper stickers.\u201cI appreciate Hillary,\u201d said Ms. Riquelme, who wore a \u201cCorporations Are Not People\u201d button on her lapel. \u201cBut I know that Elizabeth Warren has a perspective that is probably healthier. She has good economic principles. She has a depth of experience, and she knows how to share her deepest heart.\u201dSpeaking before Ms. Warren\u2019s talk, Alyssa Aguilera, 27, a community organizer in New York, said, \u201cI think Hillary has a better chance of beating a Republican, but I think Elizabeth Warren is a better progressive.\u201d After hearing Ms. Warren, Ms. Aguilera said, \u201cI\u2019m ready for Warren!\u201dMrs. Clinton declined an invitation to speak, organizers said. Democratic analysts said that was no surprise \u2014 for her to attend such a gathering would have been tantamount to announcing a presidential run, which she is not yet ready to do.

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Congressman\u2019s Plan to Fight Poverty Shifts Efforts to States", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, outlined a plan to combat poverty on Thursday that would consolidate a dozen programs into a single \u201cOpportunity Grant\u201d that largely shifts antipoverty efforts from the federal government to the states.\u201cThe people on the ground, they\u2019re the vanguard,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey fight poverty on the front lines.\u201dMr. Ryan\u2019s proposal gives new policy backbone to Republicans\u2019 recent promises to address poverty and is part of a broader political strategy to increase the party\u2019s appeal. This has given Mr. Ryan, the Republican nominee for vice president in 2012, the opportunity to show that he and his party are as concerned about the poor as Democrats are while offering a drastically different approach to addressing poverty.His plan includes a mix of both traditional Republican tax proposals to expand the earned-income tax credit and reduce regulations and some new commitments to reducing criminal sentencing and recidivism.Mr. Ryan tumbled somewhat awkwardly into the antipoverty discussion this year when he said a \u201ctailspin of culture in our inner cities\u201d perpetuated poverty, a comment that Democrats and some African-American groups called racist. But since then, Mr. Ryan has appeared to try to make amends, traveling the country to listen to Americans in poorer cities as he prepared to unveil this proposal.The Opportunity Grants resemble block grants to individual states, which would have autonomy to spend on whatever antipoverty programs they desire as long as Washington approves the plan. The federal government currently spends about $800 billion on social welfare programs like food stamps and housing assistance. Mr. Ryan said that total spending would remain the same, and that his plan would not add to the deficit.Mr. Ryan\u2019s previous broad policy introductions outlined in his budgets have focused on deficit reduction, but he emphasized that this antipoverty proposal focused on overhauling, not curtailing, the safety net.\u201cIt is important to note that this is not a budget-cutting exercise \u2014 this is a reform proposal,\u201d the policy discussion draft said. \u201cThis proposal seeks to create the space and flexibility necessary for local, state and federal government to add value without making judgments about the right level of spending.\u201dIf a state opted into the pilot program, it would have low-income residents meet with case managers who would create an \u201copportunity plan\u201d offering both financial advice and coordinating the provisions of the several different programs they need. The residents would sign contracts with these case managers that would offer incentives to reach financial security and sanctions if they do not.\u00a0A neutral agency would evaluate each provider\u2019s success at moving poor Americans out of poverty.\u201cThe point is, don\u2019t just pass a law and hope for the best,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got an idea, let\u2019s try it.

The apparent rush to put it down suggests that, well, we\u2019re human.So let me satisfy this demand with my own \u201cIdiot\u2019s Guide to Inequality.\u201d Here are five points:Inequality causes problems by creating fissures in societies, leaving those at the bottom feeling marginalized or disenfranchised. That has been a classic problem in \u201cbanana republic\u201d countries in Latin America, and the United States now has a Gini coefficient (a standard measure of inequality) approaching some traditionally poor and dysfunctional Latin countries.For example, financiers are wealthy partly because they\u2019re highly educated and hardworking \u2014 and also because they\u2019ve successfully lobbied for the carried interest tax loophole that lets their pay be taxed at much lower rates than other people\u2019s.Likewise, if you\u2019re a pharmaceutical executive, one way to create profits is to generate new products.

This arms race leaves these desires unsated; there\u2019s still only one at the top of the heap.There\u2019s still a great deal we don\u2019t understand about inequality. But whether or not you read Piketty, there\u2019s one overwhelming lesson you should be aware of: Inequality and lack of opportunity today constitute a national infirmity and vulnerability \u2014 and there are policy tools that can make a difference.Nicholas Kristof\u2019s column on July 24 incorrectly described the richest 85 people in the world.

{"Headline": "Hiring Is Strong and Jobless Rate Declines to 6.1%", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican companies are finally getting comfortable enough with the economy\u2019s prospects to add new workers at a very healthy pace, after years of saying they lacked the confidence to hire people aggressively during a fitful recovery. Employers added 288,000 jobs in June, the Labor Department said Thursday, the fifth month in a row that hiring has topped the 200,000 mark. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.1 percent last month, the best reading since September 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers turned what had been a mild recession into an economic rout.Since then, many segments of the economy have rebounded \u2014 including corporate profits, Wall Street and the housing market \u2014 even as payrolls inched higher at a grindingly slow rate. Now, these broader economic gains are prompting businesses to actually hire significantly more workers in response to growing demand, rather than taking half steps, like adding hours to stretch existing work forces.The prospect of stronger economic growth, with healthier consumer spending as more Americans find work, helped to lift the stock market to new highs. On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 17,000 for the first time, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index recorded a new high and the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit its highest level since the go-go days of 2000. Despite the broad gains, the economy is still a long way from its peak before the housing bubble burst and the recession began at the end of 2007. The broadest measure of unemployment, which includes people who are working part time because full-time positions are not available, stands at 12.1 percent. And the proportion of Americans in the labor force has been stuck for three straight months at 62.8 percent, a 36-year low, and is down sharply from 66 percent in 2008. But the recent healthy level of hiring looks more sustainable than it has in years. Factoring in June\u2019s increase and upward revisions for estimated hiring in April and May, employers added an average of 231,000 workers a month in the first half of 2014, the best six-month run since the spring of 2006. \u201cWe\u2019re clicking on all cylinders in terms of job growth,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays.The Labor Department reported that employers added 288,000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage points to 6.1 percent.Just as significant as the headline figures, Mr. Maki said, is that June\u2019s hiring was broad-based, as industries as varied as health care, manufacturing, financial services and retailing all added workers. \u201cEvery major sector showed job growth in June, including the private service sector, where the bulk of jobs in the U.S. are created,\u201d Mr. Maki said. In an important turnabout, there were encouraging gains not just in well-paid white-collar professions, or in low-wage sectors like retail and restaurants, but also in the vast middle tier of jobs that enable workers to gain a foothold in the middle class. For example, manufacturers hired 16,000 workers, while transportation companies added 17,000 employees and the long-dormant public sector saw an addition of 26,000 positions. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a strong report,\u201d said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. \u201cThere really aren\u2019t that many clouds.\u201d Despite the stock market jump, the more robust rate of hiring is making some traders nervous that the Federal Reserve will be forced to start raising short-term interest rates earlier than had been expected to ward off any risk of higher inflation. The drop in the unemployment rate to near 6 percent comes months earlier than the Fed had expected; the central bank had predicted it would take until the end of the year for the jobless rate to reach that level. While the Fed\u2019s program of buying bonds to stimulate the economy is on track to end in October, most economists have been predicting the first increases in short-term rates would not come until the summer or early fall of 2015. Now, some experts like Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics say the Fed could move as soon as March. Despite such concerns, there was little hint of accelerating wage inflation in the data in June, a crucial trend that the Fed watches to gauge the broader danger of higher inflation. Wages are up just 2 percent from the period a year earlier, in line with the inflation rate today as well as the overall rate of salary increases over the last four years.Some of the recent job gains represent a catch-up for employers that put off hiring during a bumpy 2013. The initial weakness in the first quarter of 2014 delayed it further, as the economy shrank 2.9 percent during a bitter winter and a downward swing for inventories.Roger Hargens, chief executive of Accumold, an Ankeny, Iowa, maker of small, highly specialized components for medical device firms and other manufacturers, had hoped to begin hiring more aggressively last year. But after the delay of a big order last fall, he waited instead. The last few months have been strong enough to persuade him to take the plunge. Orders in June hit their best level ever, with much of the demand coming from overseas customers. Accumold\u2019s products include the exterior plastic shells of hearing aids, as well as the tiny tools used by doctors to remove cataracts or perform laparoscopic surgery. Accumold added three workers last month at its facility in the Des Moines suburbs, and the company plans to hire another 10 to 20 employees in the second half of the year, bringing the total work force to just under 200 people. By the end of 2015, Mr. Hargens hopes to employ 220 to 230 people at his company, where the typical production worker earns about $17 an hour while people with technical expertise often make at least $25 an hour.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to scale up in a big way,\u201d said Mr. Hargens, who is heading to Europe on Monday to meet with customers in Switzerland, France and Britain. \u201cWe had to hold off, but now we\u2019re back on track.\u201dAs the story of Accumold suggests, the 70 million American workers with a high school diploma or some college, who make up the largest group in the work force, are finally seeing some of the gains only college graduates had enjoyed earlier in the recovery. Unemployment among high school graduates fell to 5.8 percent in June from 6.5 percent a month earlier, and joblessness among people with some college or an associate degree fell to 5 percent, from 5.5 percent in May. The unemployment rate among college graduates increased 0.1 percentage point to 3.3 percent.Mr. Maki, the Barclays economist, said that among workers with only a high school diploma, employment was actually falling at this point in 2013 by 16,000 a month on a yearly basis. Now, he said, employers are adding 29,000 high school graduates a month.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more significant gains among those who have less than a college degree,\u201d Mr. Maki said. \u201cThe trend is beginning to shift.\u201dAn earlier version of this article stated incorrectly the day that administration officials reacted to the jobs data. It was Thursday, not Friday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Industrial Output Rises in Japan", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s industrial output recovered slightly in May after a sales tax increase in April, stabilizing as factories produced more machinery, vehicles and electronic devices.The data released on Monday showed that factory output in Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, after the United States and China, climbed 0.8 percent in May, compared with a year earlier, and was up 0.5 percent from the month before, the Economy Ministry reported. Output fell 2.8 percent in April.Manufacturers have rising inventories and are forecasting a decline in output in June before a further recovery in July and beyond, the report said.Assuming output falls as expected in June, Japan\u2019s manufacturing is likely to decline 3.1 percent in the April-June quarter, Marcel Thieliant, an economist with Capital Economics, said Monday.\u201cThe rise in industrial production in May suggests that the sector is recovering from the weakness caused by the consumption tax hike,\u201d he said.The increase in the sales tax to 8 percent from 5 percent is expected to cause a contraction in the economy in the April-June quarter, as demand has fallen off after a rush of purchasing earlier in the year to beat the tax increase\u2019s introduction.Japan\u2019s economy was the one of the best performing in the industrial world in the first three months of the year, growing 6.7 percent from the year before and helping push the unemployment rate to 30-year lows.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has championed an economic strategy aimed at breaking Japan free of years of deflation. The theory is that companies and households will spend more now if they expect things to cost more in the future because of inflation.But for most families struggling to get by on incomes that have been falling since 1997, wages must rise to keep purchasing power constant. Despite some of the biggest wage increases in years for employees of some of the biggest companies, like Toyota Motor, incomes of salaried households dropped in May an inflation-adjusted 4.6 percent from the year before, to an average 421,117 yen, or about $4,160. It was the eighth consecutive monthly decline.So far, wage increases have been mainly in limited categories of jobs, most of which are contract or freelance work in areas like trucking and construction.Although there are shortages of labor in some important industries, the recovery so far is not helping push base wages higher for workers as a whole. As in the \u201cjobless recovery\u201d in the United States, Japan\u2019s rebound so far has mostly increased the hiring of temporary or contract workers, as rising prices and the tax increase have eaten into consumers\u2019 purchasing power.The consumer price index climbed 3.4 percent in May from a year earlier, the fastest increase since the oil shock in 1982, as rates for electricity are 10 percent higher and the rise in the sales tax also pushed costs sharply higher.The central bank estimates that about 2 percent of the increase can be attributed to the increase in the sales tax rate.But household spending fell 8 percent in the sharpest drop in three years, after the spending spree before the higher tax took effect.Advertisement"}

Since then, it has helped defeat totalitarianism (more than once), established the world\u2019s currency of choice, sent men to the moon, built the Internet, nurtured the world\u2019s largest economy, financed medical research that saved millions of lives and welcomed eager immigrants from around the world.But much of the mistrust really does reflect the federal government\u2019s frequent failures \u2013 and progressives in particular will need to grapple with these failures if they want to persuade Americans to support an active government.When the federal government is good, it\u2019s very, very good. When it\u2019s bad (or at least deeply inefficient), it\u2019s the norm.And yet there is some good news in this area, too. The explosion of available data has made evaluating success \u2013 in the government and the private sector \u2013 easier and less expensive than it used to be. At the same time, a generation of data-savvy policy makers and researchers has entered government and begun pushing it to do better. They have built on earlier efforts by the Bush and Clinton administrations.The result is a flowering of experiments to figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t.One current trial is evaluating whether federal workplace inspections improve worker safety. Another looks at one-on-one counseling that tries to help low-income students graduate from college. A third trial is examining whether nurses in Durham, N.C., improve infants\u2019 health by visiting them in their homes. The most expensive of these three trials costs just $183,000.In every case, you can imagine why supporters of the programs would assume that randomized trials weren\u2019t necessary: Officials make an effort to design the programs carefully, and their approach sounds sensible. The policies often mimic ideas that seemed to work in other places. But history tells us that many fail nonetheless.The new efforts to measure success are an attempt to be more hardheaded about this reality.None of this work is sexy. Rigorous evaluation, randomized trials and social impact bonds will never stir the political passion that calls for universal health insurance or lower taxes do. If anything, measurement and accountability are destined to provoke more opposition \u2013 from interest groups that have something to lose \u2013 than support. (This opposition often takes the form of, \u201cMeasurement is hard,\u201d as if that were a reason to skip it.)But in a divided country, where Congress only rarely passes far-reaching legislation, a more effective government may be the best way for both sides to get more of what they want: a government that is limited enough to protect individual freedom and ambitious enough to improve people\u2019s lives.The United States government has historically been good at the big stuff, from fighting wars to breaking new scientific ground. It\u2019s everything else that tends to present a problem.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Weekend Gas Prices Drop, but Iraq Crisis Is a Threat", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Gasoline prices are drifting lower just in time for the Fourth of July weekend, although they remain at the highest levels for this time of year since 2008 mainly because of the crisis in Iraq.\u201cIf you see street prices change between now and Sunday, people will probably be surprised to see them slip by a penny or two per gallon,\u201d said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for GasBuddy.Normally prices at the pump decline 15 to 20 cents a gallon after Memorial Day as refineries complete their seasonal maintenance and they reach full production of summer grades. But this year gasoline prices remained elevated because oil markets were rattled last month when Iraqi Islamist militants swept across the north and west of the country and threatened to attack Baghdad.The markets have begun to calm over the last two weeks because there have been no significant attacks on southern Iraqi oil fields and export terminals, and there are signs that Libyan oil exports may increase in the coming days.Production in Iraq fell by roughly 170,000 barrels a day in June, a trickle relative to the global 90 million barrel-a-day market. That decline was because of technical production and export issues rather than fighting.Gasoline futures remain higher than normal for this time of year, but oil experts note that wholesale prices have come down in the Midwest and Gulf of Mexico states by as much as 10 to 15 cents a gallon in recent weeks \u2014 to levels lower than before the Iraq crisis. That signals that prices at the pump could decline further unless the situation in Iraq deteriorates or a hurricane interrupts Gulf of Mexico oil production and refinery production.Energy experts said that the average price of a gallon of gasoline was now roughly 19 cents higher than it was a year ago and at the highest level since 2008 before high oil and gasoline prices plummeted as the economy slowed after the financial crisis.Over the last six years, domestic oil production has soared by more than 50 percent and imports have declined significantly. That has given the world market a cushion as production in many Middle Eastern and North African countries has been interrupted by political turmoil. Along with the Iraqi crisis, stronger than expected gasoline demand in the United States has raised oil and gasoline prices.But energy experts said that while traders had been pouring investment money into oil in the last month, they are getting nervous. Fears of tight global supplies eased this week after the Libyan government and militia leaders controlling two key oil ports said they had reached an agreement to reopen the terminals, potentially adding as much as 560,000 barrels a day.Oil and security experts warn, however, that announcements of Libyan port openings have come before and have not materialized as negotiations between the weak central government and militias broke down. International oil prices in recent years have typically veered up and down a few dollars as Libyan production has oscillated.\u201cIf the ports do open,\u201d said Geoff D. Porter, head of North Africa Risk Consulting, \u201cthey will probably quickly close again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Hobby Lobby Ruling Means for America", "Date": "2014-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyThe notion that corporations are people is ridiculous on its face, but often true. Although Mitt Romney was mocked for saying it on the campaign trail a few summers ago, the U.S. Code, our national rule book, defines corporations as people in its very first sentence. And since the 19th century, the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations are entitled to a wide range of constitutional protections. This was a business decision, and it was a good one. Incorporation encourages risk-taking: Investors are far more likely to put money into a business that can outlast its creators; managers, for their part, are more likely to take risks themselves because they owe nothing to the investors if they fail.The rise of corporations, which developed more fully in the United States than in other industrializing nations, helped to make it the richest nation on earth. And economic historians have found that states where businesses could incorporate more easily tended to grow more quickly, aiding New York\u2019s rise as a banking center and helping Pennsylvania\u2019s coal industry to outstrip Virginia\u2019s. The notion of corporate personhood still sounds weird, but we rely upon it constantly in our everyday lives. The corporation that published this column, for instance, is exercising its constitutional right to speak freely and to make contracts, taking money from some of you and giving a little to me.Since the 1950s, however, the treatment of corporations as people has expanded beyond its original economic logic. According to Naomi Lamoreaux, a professor of economics and history at Yale University, the success of incorporation led states to broaden eligibility to advocacy groups, like the N.A.A.C.P. and the Congress of Racial Equality, which then became \u201cthe first corporations to convince the Court that they deserved a broader set of rights.\u201d Ever since, the court has intermittently extended the logic of those rulings, and in 2010 it ruled that an advocacy group called Citizens United had the right to spend money on political advertising \u2014 and that every other corporation did, too. Last month, it added religious rights to the mix.The basic justification is that corporations, owned by people, should have the same freedoms as people. And in many ways, of course, they already do. Chick-fil-A does not sell sandwiches on Sundays. Interstate Batteries tells prospective employees, \u201cWhile it is not necessary to be a Christian to be employed, it is a part of the daily work life for Interstate team members.\u201d In 1999, Omni Hotels said its new owner, a Christian, had made a \u201cmoral decision\u201d to stop selling pay-per-view pornography.But corporations, as F. Scott Fitzgerald might have put it, are not like you and me. Those special legal powers, which allow them to play a valuable role in the economy, can also give them the financial power to tilt the rules of the game by lobbying for particular legislation, among other things. \u201cThose properties, so beneficial in the economic sphere, pose special dangers in the political sphere,\u201d Justice William Rehnquist wrote in a dissenting opinion from a 1978 ruling that is a precursor to Citizens United. \u201cIndeed, the States might reasonably fear that the corporation would use its economic power to obtain further benefits beyond those already bestowed.\u201dThe danger is not only that corporations can act at the expense of society, but also that the people who control them can act at the expense of their own shareholders, employees and customers. While the Hobby Lobby decision ostensibly addresses only a narrow set of circumstances \u2014 a corporation with relatively few owners, a religious objection to particular kinds of birth control \u2014 these sorts of limited rulings have a history of becoming more broadly cited as precedent over time. Also, the logic of this particular decision was so expansive and open-ended. \u201cA corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote. \u201cWhen rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people.\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in her dissenting opinion that a corporation might object on religious grounds to paying for blood transfusions, vaccinations or antidepressants. Other scholars say the same logic could justify a right to privacy as a shield against regulatory scrutiny, or a right to bear arms.Minority shareholders have little power to influence the choices that corporations make. Benjamin I. Sachs, a law professor at Harvard University, notes that while federal law lets union members prevent the use of their dues for political purposes, shareholders do not have similar rights. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to say that collectives have speech rights, then we should treat unions and corporations the same,\u201d Sachs told me. Employees are even more vulnerable. When companies like YUM! Brands, which owns KFC and Taco Bell, campaign against minimum-wage increases, they are effectively using the profits generated by their employees to limit the compensation of those same employees. And of course, some of Hobby Lobby\u2019s 13,000 workers will now need to pay for contraception.Shareholders can sell their shares, sure, and employees can find new jobs. But every increase in corporate rights is a potential limitation on the menu of available jobs and investments. \u201cThe idea that if you don\u2019t like what the corporation is doing you should sell your stock, or find a different job, has a certain amount of appeal,\u201d said Darrell A.H. Miller, a professor of law at Duke University. \u201cBut it also assumes that people are able to just fish and cut bait. Capital is easier to move around than your body and your family.\u201dIf the court follows the logic of its Hobby Lobby decision in the decades to come, it\u2019s not so hard to imagine a job market where people must interview employers about their religious and political views. Or where people who need to make a living may just feel compelled to accept a work environment increasingly shaped by their employers\u2019 beliefs.Binyamin Appelbaum is an economics reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Welcome to the Everything Boom, or Maybe the Everything Bubble", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestor OutlookWelcome to the Everything Boom \u2014 and, quite possibly, the Everything Bubble. Around the world, nearly every asset class is expensive by historical standards. Stocks and bonds; emerging markets and advanced economies; urban office towers and Iowa farmland; you name it, and it is trading at prices that are high by historical standards relative to fundamentals. The inverse of that is relatively low returns for investors.The phenomenon is rooted in two interrelated forces. Worldwide, more money is piling into savings than businesses believe they can use to make productive investments. At the same time, the world\u2019s major central banks have been on a six-year campaign of holding down interest rates and creating more money from thin air to try to stimulate stronger growth in the wake of the financial crisis.\u201cWe\u2019re in a world where there are very few unambiguously cheap assets,\u201d said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s biggest asset managers, who spends his days scouring the earth for potential opportunities for investors to get a better return relative to the risks they are taking on. \u201cIf you ask me to give you the one big bargain out there, I\u2019m not sure there is one.\u201dBut frustrating as the situation can be for investors hoping for better returns, the bigger question for the global economy is what happens next. How long will this low-return environment last? And what risks are being created that might be realized only if and when the Everything Boom ends?Around the world, nearly every asset class is expensive by historical standards. Just last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average passed 17,000 for the first time.Safe assets, like United States Treasury bonds, have been offering investors paltry returns for years, ever since the global financial crisis. What has changed in the last two years is that risky assets, like stocks, junk bonds, real estate and emerging market bonds, have also joined the party.Want to buy shares of American companies? At the current level of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, every dollar invested in stocks buys you about 5.5 cents of corporate earnings, down from 7.4 cents two years ago \u2014 and lower than just before the global financial crisis in 2007-8.Prefer a more solid asset? The price of office and apartment building has risen similarly; office space in central business districts nationwide costs $300 per square foot on average, up from $147 in early 2010, according to Real Capital Analytics. In Manhattan, an investor in an office building can expect rent payments after expenses to add up to only a 4.4 percent return, known as the capitalization rate, lower than even in 2007, the top of the last boom.What about overseas investments? Spain and other Southern European countries that were the nexus of the European debt crisis are not the only places where bond rates have plummeted (even Greece was able to issue bonds at favorable rates earlier this year). Emerging markets, which generally have higher interest rates because of higher inflation and less political stability, are offering record low interest rates as well. Bonds issued by the governments of Brazil and Malaysia, for example, are currently yielding only around 4 percent.The high valuations now aren\u2019t as extreme as those of stocks in 2000 or houses in 2006; rather, what is new is that it applies to such a breadth of assets. In 2000, when the stock market was, with hindsight, a speculative bubble, other assets like bonds, emerging market investments and real estate looked reasonable.The Everything Boom brings obvious economic risks. In the most pleasant outcome, global economic growth would pick up, causing today\u2019s expensive assets to begin looking more reasonably priced. But other outcomes are also possible, including busts in one or more markets that could create a new wave of economic ripples in a world economy still not fully recovered from the last crisis.There are two principal reasons behind this low-return environment, though people might dispute which is the cause and which is the effect.Global central banks have been on an unprecedented campaign of trying to stimulate growth through low interest rates and of buying assets with newly created money. If the Federal Reserve keeps its short-term interest rate target near zero until next year, as most officials of the central bank expect, it will have maintained the zero-interest-rate policy for seven years. The Fed held $900 billion in assets in August 2008; now that number is $4.4 trillion and counting, with the third round of asset-buying set to expire at the end of the year. Central banks in Britain, Japan and the euro zone have pursued similar policies.In a view widespread in the capital markets, the low returns are a byproduct of those low rates. The Fed and other central banks have siphoned off trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of the supply of global investments, and private investors are having bidding wars for whatever is left.\u201cInterest rates are so low,\u201d said Peter J. Clare, a managing director and co-head of the United States buyout group at private equity firm the Carlyle Group. \u201cThere are few other attractive places where investors can direct their money, so it drives investor money into equity markets. It\u2019s just the most basic of supply and demand equations: When there\u2019s more demand, it drives up the price and pushes valuations where they are today.\u201dBut while central banks can set the short-term interest rate, over the long run rates reflect a price that matches savers who want to earn a return on their cash and businesses and governments that wish to invest that savings \u2014 whether in new factories or office buildings or infrastructure.In this sense, high global asset prices could be the result of a world in which there is simply too much savings floating around relative to the desire or ability of businesses and others to invest that savings productively. It is a reassertion of a phenomenon that the former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke (among others) described a decade ago as a \u201cglobal savings glut.\u201dBut to call it that may not get things quite right either. What if the problem is not too much savings, but a shortage of good investment opportunities to deploy that savings? For example, businesses may feel that capital expenditures are unwise because they won\u2019t pay off.Mr. Bernanke himself has been wrestling with the possibility that the original framing of a global savings glut got the problem in reverse. \u201cI may have made a mistake in trying to assign a name,\u201d Mr. Bernanke, now at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview. \u201cA glut means more than is wanted. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily arise because people want to save more. It can be because they invest less.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that if you look at the world, you have slow-growing advanced economies, China cutting back on capital investments, that the rate of return is just going to be low.\u201dIf this analysis of the world is correct, investors have an unpleasant choice: consign themselves to returns lower than the historical norm, or chase ever more obscure investments that might offer an extra percentage point or two of return.The Upshot presents news, analysis\nand graphics about politics\nand policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Threatens to Block Global Trade Deal", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 India could put a landmark World Trade Organization deal in jeopardy at hectic negotiations in Geneva after saying that it would withhold support for the agreement unless there was simultaneous progress on resolving a dispute over its food security program.India would like the W.T.O. \u2014 which set itself a deadline of July 31 for the deal on the movement of goods across borders \u2014 to address its concerns over a cap on subsidies that could limit government stocks of grain that are part of its food program.A meeting of the General Council, the W.T.O.'s highest nonministerial decision-making body, was suspended Thursday because of a lack of consensus. A group of 25 member states, including Australia, Canada, Norway, Switzerland and Thailand, issued a statement saying they were \u201cdismayed\u201d by the failure to reach an agreement.\u201cA decision to step away would be in no one\u2019s interest,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt would seriously undermine the ability of the W.T.O. to deliver for the future.\u201dThe European Union expressed a similar sentiment: \u201cWithout adoption of the Trade Facilitation Protocol by July 31, a great opportunity to mobilize trade as an instrument for growth and development would be lost, and the credibility of the W.T.O., which has during the financial crisis proven its value as a firewall against protectionism, would be further damaged.\u201d The European Union added that it was not willing to renegotiate the \u201cbasic elements or timelines.\u201dUnder an established schedule, an agreement on the first phase must be completed by July 31, when all of the 160 member countries would sign the measure, creating a protocol. A veto from the Indian government would disrupt that process.The trade package, initially agreed on at a ministerial meeting in December in Bali, Indonesia, is the first comprehensive multilateral agreement reached by the organization since its inception in 1995. The agreement, aimed at streamlining global trade, would create legally binding commitments for all member countries to decrease red tape, upgrade border infrastructure and simplify customs procedures to ensure the easier movement of goods across international borders.Proponents of the measure say that it would lead to the infusion of $1 trillion into the global economy and add 21 million jobs. Critics point out that developing countries would have to make a substantial investment to modernize their ports and borders.To provide food to the millions of its citizens living below the poverty line, the Indian government buys grain from farmers and stockpiles it for a public distribution system, in which it is sold at government-run stores at subsidized prices.The National Food Security Act, introduced by the government last year, extended the subsidy to 75 percent of India\u2019s rural population and 50 percent of the urban population. But W.T.O. rules mandate that countries cannot subsidize more than 10 percent of grain produced for food, because doing so would distort the market for trade. India wants to eliminate that ceiling to maintain its food security program.In the first week of July, India vetoed the trade agreement at a preparatory meeting in Geneva, saying that talks about finding a permanent solution to the subsidy issue were not progressing. India\u2019s commerce secretary, Rajeev Kher, said in a statement that his country would find it difficult to sign the protocol until \u201cwe have an assurance and visible outcomes which convince developing countries that members will engage in negotiations with commitment to find a permanent solution on public stockholding.\u201dW.T.O. members, including India, agreed in Bali last December to a temporary solution where developing countries would not be penalized for breaching their subsidy levels until a permanent solution was found by 2017, but the Indian government now wants immediate talks.\u201cThe trade facilitation agreement stands to benefit India as well if India becomes a signatory,\u201d said Rajrishi Singhal, a senior geoeconomics fellow at Gateway House, a foreign policy research group based in the Indian city of Mumbai. \u201cBut strategically speaking, India doesn\u2019t want to delink the food security issue from the issue of trade because once the trade agreement is signed, India loses its leverage in its talks for getting a permanent solution to the food security issue.\u201dDiplomats in Geneva have expressed frustration that India has changed its position and is holding up talks without making specific demands. Failure to push through with the Bali agreement would deal a significant blow to the good will created in the W.T.O., which has failed to reach any significant global trade agreement in a decade, and would make it harder to reach any future agreement, some member countries said in statements. If the global trade agreement is stalled, diplomats said, it is likely that members like the European Union and United States will shift their efforts to regional deals such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Indian negotiators are concerned that since the deal was struck in Bali, discussions have focused on trade facilitation while the issue of food subsidies has been sidelined. \u201cThere is a growing disenchantment, anguish and anger in our domestic constituencies and a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as once again they see the interests of developing countries being subordinated to the might of the developed world,\u201d the Indian government said in a statement at a W.T.O. meeting earlier this month.India\u2019s food subsidy program, on which the government spends about $19 billion each year, is riddled with inefficiency, experts say, and the country\u2019s malnutrition crisis continues unabated. A recent study showed that the proportion of underweight children has remained unchanged over the last seven years.Some analysts argue that food security is a domestic issue not to be decided by an international body. \u201cFood security is universally recognized as something that is in the hands of a country\u2019s government,\u201d said Biswajit Dhar, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. \u201cSovereign countries have the right to decide how they are going to deliver food to their people.\u201dAs the Bharatiya Janata Party government prepares for state elections that will have a direct bearing on the party\u2019s strength in the upper house of Parliament, taking a tough stance on food security for India\u2019s impoverished millions could be considered a political trump card. \u201cFood security is a very sensitive political issue in India,\u201d said Mr. Singhal of Gateway House. \u201cIf the narrative dominating the political rhetoric in India is that the B.J.P. has given away our food security to benefit some exporters, it will not work for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Quite an M Car, but Stirring in Spirit", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel9 PhotosHere\u2019s a tire-kicking experiment: Pay a visit to your BMW dealer. Weave through the sleek wares on display \u2014 but tiptoe around that strange blobby thing called a 5 Series GT. Now, stop when you see a window sticker that\u2019s less than $40,000. I won\u2019t hold my breath. BMW isn\u2019t alone. As compact and midsize luxury models have steadily inflated in size and price, the carmakers have noticed the gaping hole at the truly small, $30,000-to-$40,000 end of their showrooms. On the crossover side, BMW has filled that hole with the petite X1, to sell alongside Xs numbered 3, 4, 5, 6 and soon, 7.With that tick-tack-toe board complete, the new 2 Series coupe arrives. And with all respect to BMW, my imaginary billboard would honestly cite the 2 Series mission statement: \u201cBecause you can\u2019t afford a 3 Series.\u201d Seriously, some fans do crave a smaller, lighter BMW, closer in spirit \u2014 if not in reality \u2014 to the primitive 2002 model that first appeared here in 1968. In 2014, that car is the 2 Series, a replacement for the 1 Series, a scrunched ball of fun that, for all its charm, seemed a bit of an outlier in the BMW lineup. Compared with the 1 models, the handsome 2 Series inherits more of the family genes, with less stubby proportions and more interior luxury and technology. And man, is it a blast to drive, especially the M235i version with its fierce 320-horsepower turbocharged in-line 6. That\u2019s actually 20 more horses than the more expensive 435i, the next rung up on BMW\u2019s coupe ladder. The wallet-pressing issue is that the 2015 M235i, which comes laden with performance-boosting gear, costs $44,050 to start \u2014 just $2,900 less than the prettier, roomier 435i. In other words, it\u2019s a BMW, not a bargain. That role falls to the 228i, amply and efficiently moved by 240 horses from the 2-liter turbo 4 found in many larger BMWs. The 2015 228i starts at $33,050 \u2014 a significant $8,375 less than the 428i coupe with the same engine \u2014 and $11,000 less than the M235i. For either version, throw in $1,800 for xDrive AWD. Aside from the budget-minded but merely 180-horsepower 320i sedan at $33,520, that 228i is effectively the only BMW car model (not counting the X1 mini-S.U.V.) with a prayer of staying below 40 grand once options are tallied.At 175.9 inches, the new coupe is nearly three inches longer than the 1 Series. A slightly lower roofline and some subtle body sculpturing help emphasize the car\u2019s length. Front headroom and rear legroom are up by 0.8 inches.Trunk space, already surprisingly generous in the 1 Series, grows a bit to 13.8 cubic feet. Channels in the apron along the front of the car direct air at the wheel arches \u2014 BMW calls the feature Air Curtains \u2014 to improve aerodynamics and reduce fuel consumption. Efficiency gets another boost from a standard engine stop-start system. And in automatic models, BMW says, a coasting mode disengages the powertrain at speeds from 30 to 100 m.p.h. when a driver lifts off the gas. Fuel economy with the automatic transmission is 23 m.p.g. in town and 35 m.p.g. on the highway for the 228i, with the M235i nearly as frugal at 22/33 m.p.g. (though the 6-speed manual drops to 19/28). In BMW\u2019s ever-confusing naming strategy, the M235i, despite its prominent M badges, isn\u2019t a full-blown M car in the vein of the M3 or M5. Yet as the first in a planned line of M Performance models, it does come stuffed with M-division gear, including a specially tuned engine, larger brakes and an adaptive, driver-adjustable suspension. Not surprisingly, reports of an actual M2 starting production next year are already circulating.Yawning air inlets up front suggest the M235i\u2019s high-speed mission. Bonus interior bits include front sport seats, an M leather multifunction steering wheel, a red-dial instrument clusterand unfortunately, BMW\u2019s dowdy Aluminum Hexagon interior trim. This being BMW, it\u2019s possible to take the good stuff for granted: The chassis, brakes, seats and stirring handling; sophisticated powertrains that are virtually unmatched in their one-two punch of power and fuel efficiency. But with that goodness a given, your attention wanders to BMW\u2019s sore spots: stingy standard features, greedily priced options and increasingly complacent interior design. Loaded up, even this 2 Series could blast past $50,000. Out-the-door at $46,575, my M235i still lacked a slew of optional luxury features, including a navigation system, high-end audio and a backup camera. The infotainment controller with a 6.5-inch screen is at least standard, with a crisper 8.8-inch unit available only with navigation. The 2 Series cabin, while well-crafted, appears stamped from BMW\u2019s aging, unimaginative corporate mold. The latest Mercedes interiors, from the C-Class to the S-Class Coupe, are more adventurous, deluxe and appealing. Mass is also a mild disappointment: Ranging from 3,300 to 3,695 pounds, the 2 Series weighs just 75 to 170 fewer than a comparable 4 Series. Yet for all that, the toy-size 2 Series delivers a boatload of driving charm. For the M235i, BMW cites a conservative yet still-blistering 4.8-second sprint from 0-60 m.p.h., abetted by the near-perfect 8-speed automatic transmission. Even the 228i automatic manages the trick in 5.4 seconds. And bless BMW for keeping the manual-transmission faith, offering its 6-speed stick on either version (though not with xDrive). Girded with M gear, a rear-drive layout and 52:48 weight distribution, the M235i presses major performance advantages over competitors that are based on front-drive chassis. Even so, the best intersection of price-and-performance may be the 228i with a $2,200 Track Handling Package. It includes an M Adaptive Suspension, sticky 18-inch Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires on alloy wheels, Variable Sport Steering and M Sport brakes. Go easy on the options, and you might even keep that 228i below the magic $40,000 mark. Just use your smartphone to navigate and buy leather pants for that luxury feeling against your skin.

{"Headline": "Seeing Cost of Saber Rattling in Ukraine, Putin Alters Course", "Date": "2014-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat shift over the past few weeks has led Kremlin analysts to conclude that Russia has started playing a waiting game with its once closest neighbor. The economic, political and military costs of any abrupt, armed action to keep Ukraine \u2014 or even parts of it \u2014 in Moscow\u2019s orbit were deemed far too high. Even the sort of indirect support that NATO and the Ukrainian government accuse the Kremlin of providing to the separatists seems to be falling into disfavor.But that does not mean that Moscow has abandoned its many goals in Ukraine, and it raises the question of whether the West will continue to allow the clock to tick away while Mr. Putin and his lieutenants pursue them.They want to ensure that Ukraine does not join NATO, and that the country is kept as weak and decentralized as possible. And they would like to extract Russia from the mess while claiming victory in protecting the rights and the lives of millions of Russian-speaking residents in southeastern Ukraine.Ukraine is nearly broke. With the West unlikely to pay the staggering costs needed to right Ukraine\u2019s economy, Moscow expects Kiev will have to find a way to restore its longstanding ties with Russia, analysts noted. In particular, it needs to reach an agreement with Moscow on natural gas supplies, now cut off, before temperatures start dropping in November. Russia also could use a deal over water, electricity and other supplies that used to flow to Crimea from Ukraine.\u201cThe main goal from the beginning has been to create the conditions so that Western structures \u2014 above all NATO \u2014 would not widen their range to include Ukraine,\u201d said Sergei A. Karaganov, dean of the School of International Economics and Foreign Affairs and an occasional Kremlin consultant. \u201cThat has been achieved.\u201d\u201cRussia is now looking for an excuse to cool down the crisis and to restore some relationship with the West,\u201d while leaving Ukraine weak, he said. \u201cIt will be unified one way or another \u2014 a weak state with a crumbling economy \u2014 that is inevitable.\u201dThe situation remains volatile, however. With Russian-backed separatists vowing to make a last stand in Donetsk and Luhansk, Moscow could still end up in a military conflict.Europe and the United States are split on the strategy going forward. Some in Washington are demanding tougher action against Russia immediately. But Europe is working the diplomatic front, with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, frequently consulting with Mr. Putin and the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, by telephone.Perhaps most important, on Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr. Putin will attend a summit meeting of the leaders of the so-called BRICS countries in the Brazilian coastal city of Fortaleza. The group \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2014 is expected to announce the formation of a new development bank, seen as an alternative to Western-dominated structures. Russia is also looking for new military cooperation agreements in America\u2019s backyard.Two or three months ago, with Crimea already annexed and 40,000 Russian soldiers deployed along the border, it seemed that Moscow was just waiting to light the fuse in Ukraine.But then came the first round of Western sanctions. They targeted a few dozen people in Russia and Ukraine, as well as their businesses, and had little direct economic impact. Psychologically, however, they made the world business community extremely wary.Russia\u2019s central bank announced Wednesday that capital flight had amounted to $75 billion in the first six months of 2014. Although Russia has not fallen into recession as some predicted, the economy is stagnant. For example, car sales are likely to drop 12 percent this year, a trade group announced this week.In late June, with the threat of more Western sanctions looming unless Russia brought calm to southeastern Ukraine, the public discourse suddenly shifted, with Mr. Putin playing the statesman.Over the past week, he has remained silent even as Ukrainian forces were routing pro-Russian separatists from their stronghold in Slovyansk and threatening further attacks. On state-run television, more moderate voices have replaced those demanding armed intervention in Ukraine.\u201cWe somewhat overdid our coverage of the events,\u201d Yevgeny Primakov, a former prime minister and foreign minister known for his anti-Western sentiments since Soviet days, said on Rossiya 24 television. \u201cThe general tone was such as if we were preparing the country for war.\u201dMr. Primakov said that Russia needed peace to preserve essential ties. \u201cIf we had deployed our troops, this would have led to a sharp deterioration of the situation in Ukraine, as well as of our relations with the West, which must be maintained,\u201d he said.In fact, separatist leaders were openly criticized, signaling that Russia doubts they can win. When Igor Strelkov, the Russian who commands the separatists, accused Moscow on his blog of \u201cabandoning\u201d his forces, he was attacked.\u201cIt was obvious from the very beginning that Donetsk and Luhansk were not Crimea,\u201d wrote the analyst, Mikhail Rostovsky. \u201cA decision to do something similar with southeast Ukraine would have been complete insanity and guaranteed the most monstrous consequences.\u201dSome in the United States say that Mr. Putin is trying to fool the world while still pursuing territorial gain.\u201cPutin doesn\u2019t have to win today,\u201d Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in hearings on Ukraine on Wednesday. \u201cHe only needs to generate a frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine that he can exploit when the world has moved on. And that has been a standard operating procedure for years.\u201dAnother question is whether Mr. Putin, after stoking nationalist sentiment for months, can suddenly pull the plug without facing backlash at home. But the waiting game will also take care of that, analysts noted, especially with Mr. Putin\u2019s approval rating staying over 80 percent.The bellicose propaganda message has already largely gone. \u201cYou make it disappear,\u201d said Konstantin von Eggert, an independent political analyst, predicting that there will be no consequences \u201cas long as it can be explained that we scored our point.\u201dNicolai Khalip contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kurdish Officials Seek More Autonomy in Any Deal With a New Government", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senior Kurdish officials served notice on Thursday that Kurdistan would not participate in a new Iraqi government unless Baghdad grants it expanded autonomy and does not insist on reversing their occupation of Kirkuk.\u201cWe are going to give once again a chance to the political process in Baghdad, but we are not going to think that is the only path,\u201d said Fuad Hussein, the chief of staff to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdish autonomous region.\u201cParallel to that we are going to build ourselves, and we are heading toward exercising self-determination,\u201d Mr. Hussein added before he went to the White House to see Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Antony Blinken, the deputy national security adviser.Mr. Hussein\u2019s comments came as Mr. Barzani asked the Kurdish Parliament, in a closed-door speech, to organize a referendum on independence, a move that caused dismay among Sunni and Shiite politicians in Baghdad.Secretary of State John Kerry has urged the Kurds to play a leading role in forming a unified government in Baghdad and to defer their dreams of independence. Or as Mr. Kerry put it in a meeting with the Kurdish president in Erbil last week, \u201cthis moment requires statesmanship.\u201dThat was a message that Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, emphasized this week: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very consistent and clear about our view that a stronger Iraq is a united Iraq, a united Iraq is a stronger Iraq.\u201d But there was no indication in comments by Mr. Hussein or Falah Mustafa Bakir, the head of Kurdistan\u2019s foreign affairs department, that the Kurds were merely seeking leverage for the negotiations in Baghdad or shelving their desire for statehood.The victories gained by the militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria were built on months of maneuvering along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.While the Kurdish officials referred to self-determination as a step the Kurds might take if the process of government formation in Baghdad fails, they also expressed doubts that the negotiations with their Sunni and Shiite counterparts would succeed. \u201cAre they going to recognize the new reality in Iraq?\u201d said Mr. Hussein, referring to Sunni and Shiite politicians who are struggling to form a government after Sunni militants captured much of western and northern Iraq and Kurdish pesh merga fighters moved to occupy and defend territories long disputed between Arabs and Kurds. That recognition, he added, would entail \u201crecognizing the border of Kurdistan\u201d and \u201crecognizing the independence of our economy.\u201d\u201cThese are questions which we will raise and we need answers,\u201d Mr. Hussein said. \u201cIf they cannot give answers,\u201d the Kurds would make their own decisions on \u201cthe future of Kurdistan.\u201dIndeed, one purpose of holding talks in Baghdad, Mr. Hussein said, may ultimately be to negotiate the terms of the \u201cdivorce\u201d between Kurdistan and Iraq.Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.\u201cWe have never been treated equally; nor have we been treated as a partner,\u201d Mr. Bakir said.After the White House meeting, Mr. Biden\u2019s office issued a statement asserting that both sides had \u201cagreed on the importance of forming a new government in Iraq that will pull together all communities\u201d and can counter the threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.Mr. Barzani\u2019s speech to the Kurdish Parliament was closed to the public, and reporters received accounts from Kurdish lawmakers who attended itMr. Barzani has stated unequivocally that he does not plan to give up Kirkuk, a city in northern Iraq that sits on substantial oil reserves. While nothing in his speech on Thursday appeared to go beyond his previous comments on Kirkuk, the insistent drumbeat that the Kurds would not cede Kirkuk and other disputed areas and planned to move toward independence made clear that a de facto partition of the country could really happen.In Baghdad, Haider al-Abadi, an influential member of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\u2019s Shiite State of Law party, said that Mr. Barzani appeared to be seeking leverage for the negotiations in Baghdad.\u201cBarzani is looking to get all the elements of a state without declaring a state,\u201d Mr. Abadi said. \u201cHe is taking everything without giving anything.\u201dEven Sunni lawmakers, who have expressed sympathy for the Kurds\u2019 frustration with Mr. Maliki\u2019s government, said they were deeply worried because it is principally Sunnis who live near the Kurdish border who would be affected if Kurdistan became an independent entity, especially if that entity included disputed areas. Sunnis, who were forcibly moved to the region more than 40 years ago as an effort by the Saddam Hussein regime to mix Iraq\u2019s sects, fear becoming marginalized as well as losing a claim to the area\u2019s oil wealth. \u201cWe hope that the Kurds\u2019 leader will not take a step which could have an impact on their partners without taking them into account,\u201d said Dafar al-Ani, a leader of a new coalition of Sunnis in the Iraqi Parliament.\u201cWe have a rooted belief in the Kurds\u2019 rights,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe do not deny the oppression that the Kurds faced for decades, and we are aware that they still have problems with the central authorities, but we hope that our brother Massoud will not take any fateful decisions which could impact his partners without discussions.\u201dKurdish lawmakers by contrast sounded a note of certainty after the speech, although they asserted that any decision would be made by the Parliament as well as the Kurdish leadership.\u201cBarzani will not make a decision alone,\u201d said Haj Karwan, a Kurdish Parliament member. \u201cThe Kurdish Parliament will have the final word on the future of Kurdistan, but our armed forces will not retreat, and we will stay in Kirkuk to protect everyone,\u201d he said, repeating, almost exactly, Mr. Barzani\u2019s words. Michael R. Gordon reported from Washington, and Alissa J. Rubin from Baghdad. Suadad al-Salhy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt Cuts Tax Breaks for Fuel; Few Protest", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 When President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt said he intended to raise the price of flour, rice and other subsidized goods in 1977, he ignited days of riots that left more than 70 people dead and stood as a lasting warning to his successors about the perils of forcing impoverished Egyptians to make do with even less.So it was a surprise when, as one of his first major policy initiatives, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi sharply raised fuel prices two weeks ago, cutting deeply into energy subsidies, the most expensive single part of the government\u2019s sprawling and expensive subsidy system. Even more surprising, perhaps, has been the absence of widespread civil unrest.The relative quiet appeared to signal an acknowledgment among many Egyptians that the fuel prices, which were among the lowest in the world, could not stay that way forever in an economy battered by years of political turmoil and edging ever closer to collapse. And it was a singular demonstration of presidential clout by Mr. Sisi, who used the kind of emotional appeals he has deployed throughout his rise to power to sell the subsidies as necessary, bitter medicine, as well as a public obligation to a charismatic leader.\u201cYou called upon me for a mission \u2014 a mission to save a nation,\u201d Mr. Sisi said in a speech after the price increases were announced, invoking the sacrifices of a previous generation during wartime. \u201cThe contract between you and me was that you work hard and bear with me,\u201d he said.While experts on Egypt\u2019s economy praised the boldness of the move, there was also criticism of how it was put into effect, and of a lack of a clear plan to ease the burden on the country\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. There was no easy way to fix the subsidy program in a country where half the population lives around or below the poverty line and relies on government support. Any mistakes carried considerable risks for the government, which faces a more impatient nation since President Hosni Mubarak was thrown out of office by protesters demanding \u201cbread, freedom and social justice.\u201d\u201cFrom a political perspective, sooner rather than later was the right thing, but they have not necessarily prepared the Egyptian population most affected by this for what is going to be a tough and long road,\u201d said Steven A. Cook, an expert in Egyptian affairs at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not convinced there\u2019s enough of a Sisi mystique to carry them along.\u201dThe decades-old system, which provides subsidies for energy and food, including sugar, flour and tea, had eaten up more than 26 percent of the national budget annually. It also was criticized for inefficiency, benefiting companies, for instance, rather than Egypt\u2019s poorest citizens. Reforming the system was seen as an attempt by the Egyptian government not just to plug a budget deficit that reached more than 12 percent of G.D.P., but also to impress international lenders, like the International Monetary Fund, as the country searched for new financing beyond the generous sums provided over the last year by wealthy Persian Gulf states.The initial announcement of the price increases seemed a rushed affair, made just hours before gas stations changed the prices of several different kinds of fuel on a Friday night, with increases of up to 78 percent. It sparked a panic among taxi drivers, who held sporadic strikes until the government gave instructions on how they should adjust their meters to accommodate the increases.At least two people were reported killed during an anti-austerity demonstration. Protests in general have become much more perilous for Egyptians over the past year, since the government has made them illegal and showed its willingness to disperse them with deadly force.Officials promised to control any price inflation, and for days the state daily, Al Ahram, featured pictures on its front page that conveyed government concern: the prime minister, Ibrahim Mehleb, assuaging the concerns of citizens at a mosque and a vegetable stand; Mr. Sisi donating money to a newly established philanthropic fund for Egypt.\u201cWas it possible to postpone this decision?\u201d Mr. Sisi asked during his speech. \u201cIt has been late for years.\u201dAs the government worked to tamp down any shock, economists were divided on the long-term consequences of the price increases for several kinds of fuel, including high-octane gas for more expensive cars as well as diesel fuel, which powers farmers\u2019 irrigation pumps and public buses. The cost of diesel increased about 64 percent, to around $1 per gallon from about 61 cents. \u201cI\u2019m impressed that he did something substantive that has real political consequences,\u201d said Ragui Assaad, an economist at the University of Minnesota who studies Egypt and said that the budget deficits were \u201cunsustainable for any country.\u201dBut the government had failed to show how it was going to compensate lower income people, he said, adding that subsidy cuts were usually accompanied by announcements of cash transfers to the poor. \u201cThat\u2019s where the program failed,\u201d he said.Reem Abdel Haliem, an economist with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said that while she agreed with raising prices on some kinds of fuel to reform the \u201cinefficient\u201d subsidy system, the rising diesel prices in particular could have a \u201chuge inflationary effect.\u201d At the same time, the government had not moved as aggressively to recover other kinds of savings, through steps including shutting down smuggling networks for fuel, that would limit the wider economic damage.And few plans were announced to expand short-term social protections, or any that reflected a longer-term focus on new initiatives in education, health care or transportation that would benefit lower income people, she said.\u201cThe main objective was to bring money to the government. This is not for social justice,\u201d she said. While acknowledging that the government seemed to have weathered any immediate backlash, she said the danger had not passed. \u201cYou will start to see spreading conflicts, because of the limitations on living standards.\u201dSome of the fears among the public were not driven solely by the price increases. Many have deep doubts about the ability of state institutions to solve Egypt\u2019s economic problems, even as the power of those institutions, long seen as corrupt and inefficient, has seemed to grow over the last year.The government was further hurt by the perception that many in the country\u2019s current ruling class seemed to be prominent figures from Mr. Mubarak\u2019s era.\u201cThe ruling coalition has been very clear from the beginning. It doesn\u2019t really include the poor,\u201d said Wael Gamal, an economic journalist and researcher. \u201cIt is the normal coalition that ruled before January,\u201d he said, referring to the 2011 revolt against Mr. Mubarak and a coalition that included the state bureaucracy, the military and \u201cthe very aggressive part of the business community.\u201d At his Cairo juice stand, Tharwat Rashid, 44, said that despite the government\u2019s promises, prices of basic goods had risen in his neighborhood. Shakedowns by public officials \u2014 by inspectors or police officers demanding payouts \u2014 also seemed to have gotten more frequent.\u201cIt is the old faces, and old ways, \" he said. \u201cYou have to clean a place before you start to build.\u201dMerna Thomas and Asmaa al-Zohairy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Importance of Shedding Some Light on Dark Pools", "Date": "2014-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestor OutlookLike the old musical said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got Trouble with a capital \u2018T\u2019 and that rhymes with \u2018p\u2019 and that stands for pool.\u201dActually, it\u2019s pools, as in dark pools: private, largely unregulated stock exchanges. Unlike the public exchanges \u2014 e.g., the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange \u2014 the dark pools are private clubs, initially used by large institutional investors that wanted to execute a large sale in a dark place.Both demand and supply pressures drove increased use of the pools. Investors wanted to avoid having their trades picked off by flash traders in the public exchanges, while the banks that set up the roughly 40 existing pools can make serious money by steering their clients into their pools.These developments raise at least two questions. First, isn\u2019t the lack of transparency in securities trading one of the things that got us into the Great Recession? Shadow(y) banking by unregulated credit providers was instrumental in underpricing risk, which in turn helped to inflate the housing bubble. While dark pools may not inflate the next credit bubble, they\u2019re equally nontransparent and under-regulated, and given the magnitude of trading that they now support, have clear systematic linkages to the financial system and thus the overall economy.Second, given that first concern, why create a nontransparent, systemically risky entity instead of directly going after the high-frequency traders?With the help of a law unique to New York State, the state\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is trying to answer those questions, and his office\u2019s progress against the nontransparency of the dark pools and the unfair advantage of the high-frequency traders is instructive.The law, known as the Martin Act, maintains that when a bank or broker omits \u201cmaterial facts\u201d about a trade or even a trading platform (i.e., an exchange), the potential for fraudulent dealing exists. This law gives prosecutors much more leeway than other state or federal securities laws to argue that the defendants intended to defraud or that the victims relied on factual misrepresentation. In other words, under the Martin Act, the court must hear securities cases even when \u201cintent\u201d or \u201creliance\u201d are not evident, as long as prosecutors can show material evidence of fraudulent actions.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office has also gotten Thomson Reuters to agree to stop selling consumer sentiment survey results to high-frequency traders two seconds before the results are publicly released, and a couple of wire services to stop selling direct feeds to high-frequency trading shops that were using that information to get a few milliseconds ahead of the rest of the market.The fact that the big exchanges have their headquarters in Manhattan gives Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office a lot of scope: If a dark pool in Chicago makes a deal that goes through New York, the Martin Act applies.But the New York attorney general\u2019s office is not a national market regulator like the Securities and Exchange Commission. Even with the Martin Act, the attorney general lacks the national clout to systematically bring transparency and symmetry in terms of price discovery back into the market.The S.E.C.'s initial approach to the issue was different. It initially helped the spread of high-frequency trading by giving its blessing to all the necessary machinations, including co-location on or near exchanges, special bandwidth allocations and high-speed switches. The regulator\u2019s position was that as long as such services were fairly priced, there was neither market failure nor grounds to rein anything in. But since few investors have either the money or expertise to set up a high-frequency trading operation, those privileged few have access to information that most others lack. And that, in fact, is an age-old recipe for market failure.We\u2019re still recovering from the deepest recession since the Great Depression, a recession that was caused by a huge real estate bubble inflated by reckless finance. Even while the current economic expansion has been going on for five years, joblessness remains high. The equity markets and corporate profitability have more than recovered, but real wages and incomes remain stagnant for low- and middle-income households.It is thus absolutely vital to understand the linkages between Main Street and Wall Street and, more specifically, the role played by under-regulated, systemically linked components of financial markets in recent boom-and-bust cycles. Dark pools may sound like some kind of mysterious niche that doesn\u2019t affect the rest of us. In fact, recent history is trying to teach us that we ignore such niches at our peril.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Industrial Production Shakes Off 2007 Doldrums", "Date": "2014-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsINDUSTRIAL production around the world plunged after the Great Recession began, and in most advanced economies has yet to fully recover. But that is not the case in many emerging economies, with production hitting new highs.The United States this week reported that industrial production, excluding construction, rose 0.2 percent in June and was up 4.3 percent from a year earlier. That is a faster rate than any other major advanced economy has shown recently, but it pales next to the rates of growth in such countries as China and India.The accompanying charts show the change in levels of industrial production since the end of 2007, as the recession was beginning in the United States. The latest report indicates that production in the United States was 3 percent higher in June than it was in December 2007. That is, however, largely because of increased oil and gas production. Overall manufacturing output is still a bit below the pre-recession levels, although production in the motor vehicle industry has been strong. The Netherlands government compiles industrial production reports from 27 advanced economies and 54 developing economies around the world, and computes international averages. Its latest report shows that world production in April was almost 12 percent higher than it had been at the end of 2007, but that production in the advanced economies was nearly 5 percent lower than it had been.In the emerging economies, production was up by more than a third from the 2007 level, primarily because of the performance of Asian countries, where production is up by more than 60 percent.China releases data only on annual changes, making any calculation of month-to-month changes hard to estimate, but it appears that its production has approximately doubled from the 2007 level. In India, production is up nearly a quarter since the recession began.The Asian boom has not helped Japan, the largest advanced economy in the region. The latest production figure is nearly 14 percent lower than the 2007 number.Until 2011, industrial production in Germany \u2014 the third largest exporter in the world, behind China and the United States \u2014 recovered more rapidly than did production in the United States. But since then, it has stabilized. In May, production remained nearly 3 percent below the 2007 level.That is, however, much better than in any of the other major eurozone countries. Over all, production in the eurozone is 11 percent lower than in 2007. Among the three largest countries in the zone other than Germany, France has done the best, with production still down 15 percent. In Italy, production is off 22 percent and in Spain it is down 28 percent.An exception to the eurozone doldrums seems to be Ireland, where production is now a little higher than it was in 2007. In May, the production figure was up more than 20 percent from the year before, a far better performance than in any of the major euro economies.In Britain, which is outside the eurozone, production also seems to have stagnated. In May, the level was 12 percent below the 2007 figure.Advertisement"}

Instead, institutional investors have been buying up relatively inexpensive homes, particularly in areas hard hit by foreclosures during and after the Great Recession.In the Atlanta area, prices of the least expensive homes have more than doubled since March 2012, when home prices nationwide hit bottom, according to the Standard & Poor\u2019s/Case-Shiller indexes of home prices.That is by far the best performance by relatively inexpensive homes in any of the 16 markets for which the S.&P./Case-Shiller indexes break out performance by thirds of the market.Atlanta is also the market in which institutional investors have been most active, accounting for 14 percent of the homes bought during the most recent eight quarters, according to figures compiled by RealtyTrac. Those investors \u2014 mostly private equity firms, hedge funds and pension systems \u2014 buy the homes to rent out.\u201cLocal investors have been telling us for some time that the institutional investors are pushing up prices, particularly at the foreclosure auctions, beyond what the local investor is willing to pay,\u201d said Daren Blomquist, a RealtyTrac vice president.\u201cWhen we look at our data, it\u2019s clear that the home price recovery has been largely driven by investors and other cash buyers,\u201d he added. \u201cAs those investors and cash buyers slow down their purchases, the big question becomes, will demand from owner-occupant buyers be enough to keep the sales and prices moving higher?\u201dThe accompanying charts show the trends in the 16 regions for the least expensive third of the market and for the most expensive third. They also show how inexpensive a home had to be to qualify for the low third in each market. The regions where institutional buyers have been most active are listed first.The figures cover broad metropolitan areas \u2014 basically the entire region in which people working in each city might choose to live \u2014 and cover only single-family homes.There is a strong relationship between overall price levels and institutional involvement. In seven markets, a $200,000 home would be in the middle third rather than the lower third of all homes. Those seven are all among the eight regions where institutional purchasers have been most active.In the three California markets listed \u2014 Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco \u2014 the cutoff for homes in the lower third is over $400,000. Those markets have had relatively low institutional participation, but low priced homes have done well. Prices are up nearly 50 percent in Los Angeles and San Diego, and by more than 70 percent in San Francisco.In each of the 16 areas, the price of less expensive homes has risen more rapidly than that of higher priced homes, at least in percentage terms. Of course, prices of the upper third may have risen by more dollars, even if the percentage change is not as large.The New York area, which stretches from Princeton, N.J., to New Haven, has behaved differently from other regions. In this market, lower priced homes are up only 10 percent over the period, far less than in any of the other 15 regions and only a little more than the 9 percent gain for higher priced homes.Lower priced homes tended to do worse during the crash, partly because they were more likely to face foreclosure. Even with the recent rises, prices in that sector are still lower than the prerecession peaks in each of the markets other than Denver.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed, on Target to End Bond Buying, Stresses Concerns on Jobs Market ", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve affirmed its commitment to stimulate the economy on Wednesday in a policy statement that said labor market conditions remained well below the level that most of the central bank\u2019s officials consider healthy.The Fed announced, as expected, that it would reduce its monthly bond purchases to $25 billion, but it gave little indication that recent signs of stronger growth had altered its determination to hold short-term interest rates near zero into 2015. Instead, the Fed emphasized its concern about the millions of Americans who still cannot find jobs. \u201cA range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources\u201d even as the unemployment rate is falling back toward normal levels, the Fed said in a statement released after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee.The statement also gave little ground to critics who worry that the Fed is ignoring signs of rising inflation, although it said Fed officials had become less concerned that inflation would continue to run below their desired annual pace of 2 percent.In effect, the Fed concluded that recent data was consistent with its expectations \u2014 neither more nor less \u2014 and so it held to its course.\u201cThis dovish message about slack in labor markets was balanced by a somewhat more hawkish message on inflation,\u201d Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note to clients. On balance, he said the Fed was \u201cacknowledging the improvement in the economic data and labor markets, but not signaling that it is in any hurry to move to rate hikes.\u201dThe Fed has already said that it plans to stop buying more bonds in October after making a penultimate purchase in September. The looming question is how long it will then wait to start raising interest rates.Some Fed officials see evidence that the economy is settling into a new pattern of modest growth, and that monetary policy has substantially exhausted its power to improve the situation. They want the Fed to retreat more quickly from its stimulus campaign, fearing that holding down interest rates will result in higher inflation, or that it will encourage excessive risk-taking by investors.Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, dissented Wednesday, citing his concern about the Fed\u2019s intent to maintain short-term rates near zero for \u201ca considerable time\u201d after the end of the bond-buying program. Mr. Fisher, despite his remarks, was one of nine votes in favor. The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her allies have taken a more cautious view, arguing that the decline in the unemployment rate appears to overstate the improvement in the labor market, because it counts only people who are looking for work. Ms. Yellen has said she expects some people who dropped out of the labor force to return as the economy continues to improve, and she has pointed to tepid wage growth as evidence that it remains easy to find workers.The statement suggested that the committee continued to back Ms. Yellen\u2019s view, said Tim Duy, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon.\u201cThe committee as a whole is still willing to give Yellen the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Mr. Duy said. \u201cAnd honestly they have good reason. Until you get upward pressure on wages, it is terribly difficult to say that she\u2019s wrong.\u201dIn recent conversations with Oregon businesses, Mr. Duy said, he heard repeatedly that it was becoming harder to hire workers, but also that businesses were unwilling to offer higher wages as an inducement, because they doubted their ability to recoup the cost through increased sales or higher prices.

{"Headline": "July 4 Reading: Income Inequality", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters To the Editor:Joseph E. Stiglitz combines passion and intellect to compose an excellent summary of the inequality issue. Other concerned economists and political thinkers should now move forward.Mr. Stiglitz cites Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d and its main theme: that the three decades after World War II, when the income division was much narrower, were an anomaly in the history of capitalism. In Mr. Piketty\u2019s opinion the solution to current inequality is a global wealth tax.There are no doubt other economically and politically feasible answers. Niall Ferguson on the conservative side and Robert B. Reich on the liberal side, among others, have suggested potential ways to reduce inequality. But the question remains: Why is there no political will to implement any solutions, whatever they may be? Where are the \u201cengaged citizens who can fight to restore a fairer America\u201d?Mr. Stiglitz has done his part; one hopes that other influential experts and activists will do theirs.To the Editor:Joseph E. Stiglitz astutely points out that \u201cjustice has become a commodity, affordable only to the few.\u201d Indeed, the growing chasm between the rich and the poor is especially stark in our justice system, where the wealthy can afford high-quality legal representation and many others must navigate complex legal proceedings alone.Recent studies have consistently found that 80 percent of civil legal needs of low-income Americans go unmet, even when they face potentially life-changing situations such as evictions and foreclosures, child custody hearings, and the loss of health care and other vital public benefits.Civil legal aid programs have made progress in leveling the playing field by providing legal assistance to countless Americans when their families, homes and livelihoods are at stake. But for these programs to ensure basic fairness in our legal system, they need more government and private support. Otherwise, our courts will be just one more arena in our society where the cards are stacked against most of us.To the Editor:Joseph E. Stiglitz\u2019s analysis of the causes of the growing income gap and the harsh effects it has on the one in three Americans who are poor or near-poor is especially noteworthy this year, the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty programs.A major lesson learned from these five decades is that programs such as Medicare, food stamps (now the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program) and Head Start are measurably effective in reducing poverty. Using the federal Supplemental Poverty Measure, our nation\u2019s poverty rate fell from 26 percent in 1967 to 16 percent in 2012.These programs and others, like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act just passed by the Senate, offer positive, realistic strategies for narrowing the income gap and providing bona fide opportunities for tens of millions of low-income people and vulnerable groups like veterans, residents of rural communities and senior citizens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Architect Gets Busy", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis buildings might not be the tallest, priciest or zaniest. But in New York, the British architect Norman Foster seems to be having a moment all the same.Four major creations from the designer, who favors lots of stainless steel and glass, are under construction or close to breaking ground in Manhattan, where the award-winning architect has been relatively quiet since starting his career five decades ago.So what\u2019s fueling the current Foster fad?Mr. Foster noted that his firm has been working in New York City for more than a decade, and that two of the upcoming projects \u2014 610 Lexington and 50 United Nations Plaza \u2014 were commissioned before the recession hit and construction was temporarily stopped. The fact that these buildings, along with the Chelsea condo that was commissioned in 2011, \u201cshould now be on site at the same time tells much about the healthy state of the New York City economy,\u201d Mr. Foster said.The Zeckendorf building, a high-rise with 43 crystalline stories facing the United Nations on First Avenue, is the farthest along of the bunch and will be Mr. Foster\u2019s first residential high-rise in the United States. Its rounded windows, which give the facade a tubular look, are now being installed, with occupancy expected early next year.When it does open, sharp-eyed residents should be able to identify the condo as a Foster design, said Mr. Zeckendorf, who added that he allowed the architect as much free rein with the project as possible.Indeed, 90 percent of the ideas there, from the lack of moldings in the apartments, to the gleaming canopy over the front door and the waterfall wall in the lobby, were from Mr. Foster. (Mr. Zeckendorf opted not to use Mr. Foster\u2019s cylindrical metal door handles, however.)Similar prices are being asked at 551 West 21st Street, a 19-story, 44-unit condominium at the West Side Highway in West Chelsea, where units are about $3,000 a square foot, or starting at $7.25 million for a two-bedroom. Contracts have been signed for about half of the building\u2019s apartments since March, according to SR Capital, the developer.Design flourishes will include windows trimmed inside and out with gold-colored metal, living rooms with white-oak herringbone floors and kitchens with marble counters. Mr. Foster, who designed all the interiors, will also supply door handles.But Mr. Foster\u2019s original design for 551 West 21st Street called for something that was much more metallic, said Scott Resnick, SR\u2019s principal, adding that he felt the shinier version looked too much like an office building. Anyway, \u201cI think this building is pretty radical,\u201d he said on a recent tour of the building, which is expected to be completed by fall 2015.Mr. Foster, 79, who grew up in Manchester, England, and attended graduate school at Yale, founded Foster Associates in 1967. In 1993, it was renamed Foster and Partners to better reflect a more collaborative approach.This spirit seems evident in Mr. Foster\u2019s New York projects; indeed, a promotional video on the website for 551 West 21st Street features not Mr. Foster but a colleague, Brandon Haw, who is no longer with the firm.Mr. Foster, who was known for much of his career for his office buildings, won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, his profession\u2019s highest honor, in 1999. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990 and given a life peerage in 1999.But Mr. Foster has been active in New York City for years. In the early 2000s, he designed a store for Asprey & Garrard, a British luxury goods retailer, which was located at Trump Tower at Fifth Avenue and lined with huge shop windows. But it closed a few years after opening.Freshest in the public\u2019s memory, though, may be the firm\u2019s design for the New York Public Library\u2019s plan to turn closed-off stacks in its main branch in Midtown into an atrium-centered lending library. In May, the library scrapped the $300 million project amid concerns about rising costs and after criticism from many quarters, including from academics who disagreed with the removal of books to create the new spaces.A slim, white-skinned hotel designed by Mr. Foster for 610 Lexington Avenue, at East 53rd Street, was shelved during the recession. But the development team of RFR Holding and China Vanke, China\u2019s largest residential developer, has recently resuscitated it as a condo and the foundation is now being poured, using Mr. Foster\u2019s original design.In a world where some architects are strongly identified with a particular style \u2014 think Frank Gehry\u2019s \u201ccrumpled-paper\u201d designs \u2014 Mr. Foster may not stand out as easily, said Nancy Packes, a real estate consultant who is not affiliated with any of his projects.But highlighting his numerous awards and massive global portfolio should help convince home buyers that he is a commodity worth investing in, Ms. Packes said. \u201cBuying apartments today is very much equivalent to buying fashion,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have haute couture without a name-brand designer. The same goes for buildings.\u201dIn 2012, Mr. Foster beat out architects like Ms. Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and Richard Rogers in a competition to design 425 Park Avenue, a 47-story, 670,000-square-foot office building at East 55th Street. It is expected to break ground next spring, after a building on the site is demolished, and be completed in 2017.And since the \u201cstarchitect\u201d trend isn\u2019t expected to abate anytime soon, demand for Mr. Foster\u2019s work should only intensify, said Michael Sorkin, an architect and writer. \u201cArchitects have become celebrities,\u201d he said, \u201cand in America, we thrive on celebrity cachet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia's Anti-West Isolationism", "Date": "2014-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s quasiwar in eastern Ukraine is in no small measure a product of long-felt anti-Western tensions within Vladimir Putin\u2019s Kremlin that are rapidly spiraling out of control. With the downing of the Malaysian airliner over territory controlled by pro-Russian insurgents, the rift between Russia and Ukraine has become an international conflict. Citizens of the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, Britain, Belgium and other countries have been killed in a war that many people in the West might have thought had little to do with them.We do not know who pulled the trigger, but we know that the armed rebels operating in the east of Ukraine have always had the vocal support of high-ranking Kremlin officials. Since late February, when Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled Kiev, Russia\u2019s official media has been bending over backward to present the new Ukrainian government as a fascist junta manipulated by the West while the Kremlin pursues its twin goals \u2014 keeping NATO and Western economic influence in check. The virulent, anti-American, anti-Western rhetoric emanating from the Kremlin has been one of the main drivers of Moscow\u2019s support for the Ukrainian conflict. This antipathy has its roots in the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the dashed hopes and disillusion that fueled an unprincipled scramble for wealth and power in the anarchy that followed.Over the ensuing decades, the leaders of the Russian establishment have grown increasingly suspicious and fiercely antagonistic toward Western economic and political institutions. Since 1993, high-ranking bureaucrats, academics, members of parliament, business executives, and top law enforcement and security officials have shown rising levels of anti-Americanism, according to a recent study by the Higher School of Economics in St. Petersburg and William Zimmerman of the University of Michigan. The source of this antipathy, according to Eduard Ponarin, a professor of sociology at the school, \u201cis elite frustration over the failure to modernize their country along some foreign models.\u201dMutual trust between Russian and American elites did rise slightly in the early years of this century. President George W. Bush and Mr. Putin exhibited a warm rapport during their first meeting, in Slovenia in June of 2001. In the aftermath of 9/11, the Kremlin voiced strong support for Washington\u2019s war on terror. But the show of cordiality did not hold: Clashes erupted over the Iraqi war, NATO expansion, and the so-called color revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. Anti-Americanism came from the top down. The Russian ruling class saw these events as hostile acts directed at Moscow by the West. President Putin, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and their supporters found it politically useful to accentuate anti-American rhetoric to garner public support, especially as the economic growth that heralded Mr. Putin\u2019s early years in power sputtered and faded. The elites who went through a profound disillusionment with the Western ways are now occupying key decision-making positions in the Kremlin, state-owned business and media. These people learned most of their survival skills in the 1990s. They know how to operate in a market that is barely regulated. They know how to keep their adversaries guessing. It\u2019s an environment where the levels of trust are low, the levels of uncertainty are high and the rule of law does not mean much.Cynical pragmatism is the order of the day. President Putin and his circle see gullibility and idealism of any kind as a politician\u2019s main weakness. Mr. Putin\u2019s skills \u2014 sharpened through the years of growing disillusionment in Russia \u2014 are uniquely suited to this environment. He is both very effective in playing upon this distrust of the West and highly adept in his politics of international disruption. While efforts by Washington \u2014 such as President Obama\u2019s push for tougher sanctions \u2014 are understandable, they feed into Putin\u2019s hands, enabling him to play the patriotic card, gaining political traction at home as he inveighs against foreign powers hostile to Russia and scores points against his domestic critics \u2014 Westernized middle class urban dwellers who see his authoritarian demagoguery for what it is.According to a 2013 report from the Valdai Discussion Club, a Russian think tank, members of the generation born in the 1980s who are now beginning to enter elite positions in Russian academic, professional and political life are increasingly suspicious about the global ambitions of the United States. These are President Putin\u2019s minions. So are the thousands of people from both sides of the Russian-Ukrainian border who have taken up arms to fight the so-called fascists.Even as they fed the flames of war, the Kremlin and the media it controls have been constantly shirking any responsibility for the fighting. Even now, Mr. Putin blames Ukraine for the downing of the Malaysian Airliner, declaring that Kiev is at fault for the region\u2019s unrest. Yet, in recent days (even before the plane went down) his pragmatic side has kicked in. Striking a statesmanlike stance, Mr. Putin has called for an international investigation into the downing of the airliner.Yet even if Russia has not directly supplied the insurgents with the missile technology that destroyed the plane, the sheer scale of the Russian propaganda machine effort against the West could not have continued without consequences. The Russian economy grows weaker as tougher sanctions take their toll, investors shun our markets and our brightest people flee the country. While our hearts go out to the families of the victims, this tragedy has another troubling side for Russians. Whether they choose to acknowledge it or not, Mr. Putin\u2019s rhetoric has come full circle: Our country has become what he has always warned us was true \u2014 a place surrounded by enemies.

Newman Cigar Company in Tampa, Fla.,\u00a0\u00a0placed humidified tobacco from a casing wheel into carts to be used in other parts of the factory. The factory faces the possibility that the Food and Drug Administration will introduce strict, expensive regulations on cigars that the Newman brothers, who own the factory, say could shutter the last working cigar factory in the neighborhood of Ybor City.TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Some unforgettable places waft into memory on a scent. For Floridians, it may be the sweetness of mangoes in Miami, the salt-sprinkled air of the Keys, the pungency of the Everglades.In Ybor City, a neighborhood in Tampa, history is cloaked in the woody, earthen notes of a cigar, the product that helped define this once-quiet town and propel it well into the 20th century. Today, the 150 cigar factory sites that dotted this historic neighborhood once redolent with the aroma of tobacco have faded away, one by one, done in by cigarettes, health concerns, the trade embargo on Cuba and competition from abroad. Many were torn down; others stand there empty or recycled for more profitable ventures.There is one exception: On the northern side of Ybor City sits the J. C. Newman Cigar Company factory, a family-owned business tucked inside a classic brick building nicknamed El Reloj, a nod to its clock tower. Both have defied the maw of modernity to outlive a century.But now J. C. Newman faces its biggest threat: the possibility that the Food and Drug Administration may introduce strict, expensive regulations on cigars that the Newman brothers, who operate the company, say could close the last working cigar factory in town.\u201cWe have gone through two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Cuban trade embargo, smoking bans, excessive taxation and competition from low-wage countries,\u201d said Eric Newman, who with his brother Bobby, owns and operates the country\u2019s oldest premium cigar business, founded in 1895 in Cleveland by his grandfather Julius Caeser Newman. \u201cThe toughest challenge of all these is the F.D.A. regulations.\u201dIf the factory closes, Tampa would lose its most historic link to the city\u2019s 128-year-old cigar legacy, a blow that many agree would be deeply felt. It is not hard to see why. Inside El Reloj, cigar workers, most of them women, sit behind 1930s-era machines and lay a long tobacco leaf on a metal plate, cutting it before it slides off to be rolled. In another room, women push pedals on machines from the 1910s that strip the stem from the leaf (the women are indelicately called strippers). The process has not changed since the 1930s when Mr. Newman\u2019s grandfather bought his first set of machines; two decades later he moved his cigar factory to Ybor City from Cleveland.The factory is dominated by rooms with broad windows facing north and south, and its original floors, barrels, ceilings and smells make it easy to reel back the decades to a time when immigrants from Cuba and Spain rolled cigars by hand to the voice of a lector reading from a book or newspaper to entertain them.All of that is now at risk.In keeping with a 2009 law granting the F.D.A. more regulatory power over tobacco products, the agency is proposing to oversee additional products including cigars and e-cigarettes. The aim is to regulate cigars as the government does cigarettes to try to discourage minors (and people, in general) from buying them in places like convenience stores and acquiring the habit, which can increase the risk of some cancers. \u201cTobacco remains the leading cause of death and disease in this country,\u201d the F.D.A. commissioner, Margaret A. Hamburg, said in the agency\u2019s announcement of the proposed new rules.Two proposals are on the table and both would hurt the factory\u2019s prospects, Eric Newman said. The proposals are still open to public comment until early August, at which point the agency will begin to finalize the rules.The first would apply cigarette-related regulations to all cigars, no matter the kind. This would most likely require that cigars, some of which are now flavored, to undergo thousands of hours of expensive and lengthy testing to meet F.D.A. approval and could mandate modern manufacturing standards the aging machines might not be able to meet.The second proposed regulation would exempt so-called premium cigars from the new rules, a move that has the potential to affect an estimated 150 American companies, including the Newman factory, said Wallace Reyes, a researcher who until recently ran a cigar company here. Premium handmade cigars are not mass produced or sold in convenience stores and contain no additives.But though the Newman Company, which also distributes Arturo Fuente cigars, sells premium cigars made in Tampa, the F.D.A. is considering a stricter definition of premium that would exclude them from the exemption.The Newman factory\u2019s premium cigars do not fit the strict F.D.A.-proposed criteria for premium because they are not wholly handmade, do not sell for more than $10, are a mixed blend and do not use whole leaf tobacco. The company\u2019s vintage machines work far slower than the more common high-speed ones, but they are still machines, and thus most likely not covered under the stricter exemption standards.The cigar industry\u2019s influence on Tampa\u2019s trajectory, from a town of 3,000 to a notable city, is hard to overstate.\u201cWhen the cigar industry relocated to the Ybor City area, it basically transformed the economy of the state from agriculture to industrial,\u201d said Mr. Reyes, who published a book on cigars last December. \u201cBy 1896, this was the mecca of the cigar industry.\u201dIt was Vicente Martinez Ybor, a Spanish immigrant from Cuba, who first saw Tampa \u2014 with its humid climate, its Gulf Coast port and new rail line \u2014 as a place for his cigar factories. In 1865, he moved his operations from Key West to what is now Ybor City. The city, later part of Tampa, produced $2.5 million in cigars in two years, Mr. Reyes said. Soon, the industry spread to West Tampa.In little time, Mr. Ybor, with two partners, built a company town aimed at deterring strikes by paying the artisans high wages and keeping them satisfied. One way to do that was to offer tabaqueros, or tobacco workers, small, newly built homes \u2014 or casitas \u2014 they could buy over time; a row still stands across from the Newman factory. Immigrants from Germany, Italy and Romania soon arrived and built businesses catering to cigar workers. The city became a hotbed for Cubans who resented Spanish control of Cuba in the 1800s, Mr. Reyes said. Workers donated manpower and a portion of their weekly pay to the fight for independence. The Cuban Revolutionary Party established offices here and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, the party\u2019s leader, visited 21 times, Mr. Reyes said.The fight to save the factory has galvanized both Democrats and Republicans, among them Gov. Rick Scott of Florida. They are lobbying the F.D.A. to look carefully at the provisions they say could unfairly exclude the cigars made in the Newmans\u2019 Tampa factory from the protection the agency may offer premium cigars.\u201cIt goes to the heart and soul of Tampa,\u201d said Representative Kathy Castor, a Florida Democrat from the area who introduced a bill to try to protect premium cigar manufacturers. \u201cThis would be a blow to our cultural history to have the last remaining cigar factory close.\u201dEric Newman, who grew up in the area, said he would not shy from fighting to keep the factory doors open. \u201cCigars are to Tampa,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat wine is to Napa and automobiles are to Michigan.\u201dAn article on July 22 about the strong possibility that Tampa, Fla., may lose its cigar industry misstated the number of years cigar factories have been in the city. It is 128 years, not 150. The error was repeated in the front-page headline and in the headline with the continuation of the article.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back From the Brink, Portugal Still Has a Long Way to Go", "Date": "2014-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLISBON \u2014 Only two months after Portugal proudly exited its international bailout program, the financial problems of the country\u2019s most powerful family have given investors an unwelcome reminder of the potential fragility of the Portuguese recovery.Portugal\u2019s stock market plunged last Thursday, helping drag equities lower around the world, after one of the companies controlled by the powerful Esp\u00edrito Santo family missed a payment on its short-term debt. The Portuguese market has since recouped some of these losses, and regulators have offered assurances that the cost of any Esp\u00edrito Santo rescue would not be sufficient to damage Portugal\u2019s public finances.But the problems of the Esp\u00edrito Santo empire have exposed a convoluted corporate structure in which industrial assets were propped up by the group\u2019s own bank, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, Portugal\u2019s second-largest bank.On Monday, V\u00edtor Bento, a banking industry executive, was appointed chief executive of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo under a deal brokered by the Portuguese central bank. Mr. Bento replaces Ricardo Esp\u00edrito Santo Silva Salgado, who was at the bank\u2019s helm for more than two decades and whose influence made him known in Portugal as \u201cDono disto tudo,\u201d or \u201cOwner of everything.\u201dThe management move is part of an effort by Portuguese authorities to show that the difficulties of the Esp\u00edrito Santo group will not threaten the country\u2019s banking system.The Esp\u00edrito Santo family has been exerting influence over Portugal\u2019s economy for more than a century, also managing to rebuild its business empire after the 1974 revolution that led to the nationalization of the family\u2019s assets. It controls financial companies but also property, energy and health care assets \u2014 through a cascade of holding companies, in part registered in Luxembourg.\u201cThey are our Rothschilds or our Rockefellers,\u201d said Maria Jo\u00e3o Gago, a journalist and co-author of \u201cThe Last Banker,\u201d a new book about Mr. Salgado and his family. \u201cThey have great influence, not only economically but also politically.\u201dOne concern is that, as the financial crisis fueled infighting between different branches of the Esp\u00edrito Santo family, its members managed to use their influence to take out loans even after regulators in Portugal and Luxembourg started investigating possible financial irregularities at some of their holding companies.After trading of its stock was suspended last Thursday, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo said in a filing that its lending exposure to other companies in the group was 1.18 billion euros, or $1.61 billion, covered by a \u201csolid\u201d level of solvency, \u20ac2.1 billion above the regulatory minimum. Whether that will stand up to scrutiny remains to be seen, but it satisfied regulators enough that the bank\u2019s shares were allowed to resume trading on Friday.The ripple effect, though, is already being felt in the country\u2019s corporate world \u2014 including at Portugal Telecom. That company is in the process of merging with Oi, operator of one of Brazil\u2019s biggest wireless networks.Portugal Telecom was due this week to get back a \u20ac900 million loan of three-month commercial paper issued by a company called Rioforte. But Rioforte is owned by Esp\u00edrito Santo International, the holding company whose missed debt payment triggered last week\u2019s market sell-off.In a further sign of how interconnected the businesses are: Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo owns a 10 percent stake in Portugal Telecom, while Portugal Telecom holds 2 percent of the bank.The family\u2019s problems, and its entangling investments, make it uncertain that Portugal Telecom will receive its debt payment, which could put the merger in jeopardy.Portugal Telecom\u2019s Brazilian partner said the Rioforte loan was inconsistent with \u201cminimum standards of good corporate governance,\u201d raising expectations that it will instead seek improved merger terms. Some Portugal Telecom directors have resigned.Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo did not respond to a request for comment. Rioforte said its management was not available for an interview.What the Esp\u00edrito Santos did is \u201ctake advantage of a bank to support weak industrial holdings,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 J\u00fadice Gl\u00f3ria, a partner at Gama Gl\u00f3ria, a law firm in Lisbon.\u201cThis is a story of poor supervision in the Portuguese system,\u201d Mr. J\u00fadice Gl\u00f3ria added. But given the lending and shareholding connections that the Esp\u00edrito Santo group built up, \u201cit\u2019s possible that the collapse of one company forces the biggest corporate shake-up since the 1974 revolution.\u201dHe was referring to the uprising that ended a military dictatorship and led to the nationalization of much of the economy, including companies owned by the Esp\u00edrito Santos.The turmoil raised Portugal\u2019s borrowing costs last week, though there is also some optimism about a Portuguese economy that has returned to growth \u2014 even if the country is still struggling with high public debt and unemployment.As a result, while Moody\u2019s downgraded Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, it maintained its growth forecast and credit ratings for Portuguese sovereign debt, arguing that the bank\u2019s problems were \u201cunlikely to jeopardize Portugal\u2019s improving fundamentals.\u201dThe Portuguese government has cash buffers of at least \u20ac15 billion at its disposal, according to Moody\u2019s, including \u20ac6.4 billion of unused international banking bailout money.In May 2011, when Portugal negotiated its \u20ac78 billion bailout, its government and international creditors allocated as much as \u20ac12 billion to keep banks afloat. Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo was the only significant bank not to tap into the bailout money.In retrospect, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about people who had a huge skeleton in their closet and did not ask for capital because they were probably doing everything possible not to open their accounts,\u201d said Antonio Rold\u00e1n, an analyst at the Eurasia Group in London.Other analysts were taking the news in stride. Marino Marin, a managing director at MLV & Company, a boutique investment bank in New York, said, \u201cWhen any financial sector modernizes, you have these kinds of situations.\u201d He added, \u201cAt best or at worst, this is an isolated case and a Portuguese affair.\u201dFamily control could decline further as creditors force them to divest themselves of assets, including equity used as collateral for loans. On Monday, one of the family companies said it cut its stake in Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo to 20 percent from 25 percent, equivalent to the collateral negotiated for a loan from Nomura, the Japanese bank.\u201cFunding cost volatility is likely to remain for Portuguese banks until the Esp\u00edrito Santo group situation is clarified and resolved,\u201d Fitch, the credit rating agency, warned on Monday. \u201cThe impact on banks in the wider periphery should only be temporary, but it highlights the fragility of investor sentiment for the region and could raise funding costs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sticking to Their Guns, Fund Managers Reaped Big Returns", "Date": "2014-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANAGERS of three of the better-performing mutual funds of the second quarter toted up their returns by hewing to the old-time virtue of patience.All three like to hang on to favored companies for years, while the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar turns over two-thirds of its portfolio annually. They\u2019re bulldogs in a world full of whippets.The Dividend HuntersDaniel Peris, co-manager of the Federated Strategic Value Dividend fund, says he aims to buy stocks that his fund can own for as long as they make sense for the portfolio and that he bases his selections on his three- to five-year projections of their dividend growth. The fund\u2019s annual turnover ratio of 14.6 percent equates to an average holding period of about 6.5 years.Low turnover isn\u2019t the only retro quality of the fund, which Mr. Peris manages with Walter C. Bean and Deborah D. Bickerstaff. The managers specialize in buying shares of companies with robust, rising dividends, even as dividends have often fallen out of fashion. \u201cIn the last 25 years, the U.S. has gone anti-dividend,\u201d Mr. Peris said. Many companies instead hoard cash or make shareholder payouts via stock repurchases.Those with beefy dividends \u2014 utilities are the archetype \u2014 are regarded by some investors as stodgy and dull. Mr. Peris said they were better termed predictable. \u201cThese are older global corporations with long records of dividend payment and dividend growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weight of history is on them to keep paying.\u201d (A common stock\u2019s total return consists of its price appreciation plus dividends.)Such well-known names as AT&T, Kraft Foods and GlaxoSmithKline are among the bigger holdings of the fund.Mr. Peris and his colleagues invest about a quarter of the portfolio abroad. That compares with about 5 percent for the fund\u2019s Morningstar peers.Besides GlaxoSmithKline, foreign companies among the fund\u2019s recent top 20 holdings have included the oil drillers Royal Dutch Shell and Total and the drug makers Merck and AstraZeneca.Mr. Peris\u2019s fund, which has an expense ratio of 0.8 percent for its institutional shares, returned 8.6 percent in the second quarter, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index returned 5.2 percent, including dividends.Big Bets on BrazilMs. Wachnitz took over the fund in March, after working as an analyst with T. Rowe Price for about a decade. She predicted that, under her stewardship, turnover would rise but stay lower than average. \u201cIt will remain consistent with a three- to five-year investment horizon,\u201d she said.A theme in her portfolio is companies that will benefit from the growth of the consumer economy. She said she sees companies such as Lojas Renner, based in Brazil, as a way to benefit from a swelling middle class in Latin America. The company was one of the fund\u2019s top holdings on May 31.A leading apparel retailer in Brazil, Lojas Renner \u201chas opportunities to grow and to improve its margins and efficiency,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should do well over the medium to long term, regardless of the economic outlook in Brazil.\u201dT. Rowe Price is known for a growth-at-a-reasonable-price philosophy of stock-picking, and Ms. Wachnitz follows that approach. She said she mostly avoids companies in regulated sectors, like utilities and telecommunications, and those in mining, long a stalwart in South America. \u201cWe\u2019re more selective in those industries because we see fewer growth opportunities,\u201d she said.In contrast, a place where the fund will almost surely continue to invest is Brazil. Running a Latin America fund necessarily means making a big bet on the country, as it\u2019s the region\u2019s largest economy. Brazilian stocks account for more than half of the MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America Index and 54.7 percent of Ms. Wachnitz\u2019s fund.Brazil has lately received much attention because of the World Cup, but a bigger factor for investors may be its election in October. President Dilma Rousseff is seeking re-election, and her policies have led to investor concern about Petrobras, the state-controlled oil and gas giant, Ms. Wachnitz said.\u201cGovernment intervention remains a key risk,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government hasn\u2019t allowed Petrobras to increase prices at the pump as much as it should have. It seems to be prioritizing its needs over the needs of the company.\u201d Still, Petrobras is one of her fund\u2019s bigger holdings because of its hefty oil and gas reserves and its potential for production growth, she said.The fund, with an expense ratio of 1.33 percent, returned 7.2 percent in the second quarter. Energy for the Long RunMr. Guinness said his fund has owned Gazprom for about 18 months. He hung on when Russia annexed Crimea, even though some investors bailed out. \u201cWe bought it because it was incredibly cheap,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were alive to the Russian risk, but the valuation was irresistible. The stock lost 15 percent, but it\u2019s recovering.\u201dThe shares have performed well enough lately that Gazprom has grown into the fund\u2019s biggest holding as of May 31.Clinging to a stock, even when it faces tumult, is typical of Mr. Guinness. His fund has a turnover ratio of 8 percent; when he likes an investment, he stays put, even if the price zigzags. \u201cI believe in buying and holding,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think our skill set is trading, and it keeps our transaction costs down.\u201dMr. Guinness, though based in London, tilts toward the United States for the fund\u2019s investments: American companies accounted for 46.5 percent of the portfolio on May 31. Top holdings included Apache, an oil and gas driller, and Valero Energy.The American emphasis grows out of the nature of the energy business, he said. \u201cAbout half of the world\u2019s oil and gas companies are domiciled in America, so our allocation has been about 45 percent to 50 percent from the get-go,\u201d he said.Mr. Guinness has managed the fund since it began in 2004. It returned 14 percent in the second quarter and has an expense ratio of 1.34 percent.An article in the Mutual Funds & E.T.F.s Report, Part 2 of this section last Sunday, about mutual funds that registered strong performance in the second quarter, misstated a strategy of Daniel Peris, co-manager of the Federated Strategic Value Dividend fund. He aims to buy stocks that his fund can own for as long as they make sense for the portfolio, basing his selections on his three- to five-year projections for dividend growth; he does not aim \u201cto buy stocks that his fund can hold for three to five years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mistrust in North Carolina Over Plan to Reduce Precincts", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHELBY, N.C. \u2014 When Alan Langley, a Republican member of the local elections board here, explains a new proposal to consolidate five voting precincts into two, it sounds procedural and well-meaning: He speaks of convenient parking and wheelchair access at the proposed polling places, and of saving more than $10,000 per election.Those precincts, however, are rich with black voters who generally vote Democratic. And when the Rev. Dante Murphy, the president of the Cleveland County N.A.A.C.P. chapter, discusses the plan, he talks of \u201cdisenfranchisement\u201d and \u201cconspiracy.\u201d\u201cWe know,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, \u201cthat this is part of a bigger trend \u2014 a movement to suppress people\u2019s right to vote.\u201dThe bitter disagreement in this city of 20,000 is part of a broader voting rights battle charged by race and partisan politics that is happening in a number of communities, many of them Southern, where changes to election laws no longer require advance approval from the federal government after a year-old Supreme Court ruling voided a key section of the Voting Rights Act.Voting rights advocates fear that these local changes \u2014 combined with a number of new state laws restricting ballot access and requiring voters to show picture IDs \u2014 amount to a concerted effort to reduce voting by minority groups. Conservatives say that the laws ensure against voter fraud, and in some cases are more cost-efficient.In places affected by the Supreme Court decision, the overt racism of the 1960s is largely a thing of the past: What often lingers is a racial mistrust that can make the moving of a polling place from a fellowship hall to a public park seem innocent to some, sinister to others.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what can prevail in the minds of two people, where they can see the same thing and think completely differently about it,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. The Cleveland County Board of Elections proposes combining five precincts into two and reducing the number of polling places in Shelby, N.C.\u201cCoverage today is based on decades-old data and eradicated practices,\u201d wrote Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u201cOur country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\u201d The precinct changes here will be decided Tuesday by the Cleveland County Board of Elections, an all-white body made up of two Republicans and one Democrat. According to Mr. Langley and Dayna Causby of the board, one of the current polling places \u2014 Putnam Baptist Church \u2014 will soon be unavailable because it is undergoing renovations.Francis X. De Luca, president of the Civitas Institute, a conservative North Carolina think tank, said it was about time that the federal government returned decision making to the local level. Forty of North Carolina\u2019s 100 counties had been required to submit election changes for preclearance. \u201cThis is something that local people can work out,\u201d Mr. De Luca said.Voting rights advocates are less trusting, as are, generally, Democrats, whose success in states like North Carolina is dependent on ensuring high black voter turnout.Advocates say it is difficult to monitor, let alone quantify, all of the local election law changes in the areas freed from government review, since the Justice Department is no longer notified of the changes they make. But a number of cases around the South have made news. In Pasadena, Tex., voters in November narrowly approved a City Council redistricting plan that critics said diluted the political power of Latinos. Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in Augusta, Ga., over a plan that moved mayoral and City Council elections from November to May, concerned that black voters would be less likely to go to the polls at the later date. The suit was dismissed by a federal judge in May.Bob Hall, executive director of Democracy North Carolina, a liberal group, rattled off a number of small-scale recent cases that he said had harmed black voters in his state: the moving of an early voting site in Hoke County; the relocation of some polling places in Rockingham County; and changes to school board districts in Guilford County.Anita Earls, executive director of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, said that before the court\u2019s ruling, black residents in a small town could go to their local election board knowing that the federal government would help them block a change that might make it harder for them to vote. \u201cBut they can no longer say that,\u201d Ms. Earls said. \u201cSomething that gave them a more level playing field is now gone. It has altered the balance of power.\u201dOn Monday, the Obama administration joined the N.A.A.C.P., the A.C.L.U. and others in court in Winston-Salem to ask a federal judge to block sections of a North Carolina law passed by the Republican legislature and currently in effect that scale back ballot access. The plaintiffs argued the law, which would also by 2016 require voters to show IDs, placed \u201cdisproportionate burdens on black voters.\u201d Mr. Murphy has been watching that story unfold from his perch in Shelby, where he is the pastor of the Shiloh Baptist Church. The city, a former textile hub, has been reinventing its economy of late, attracting a mixture of automotive and tech industry jobs. But Mr. Murphy said that hiring decisions here too often occur within a whites-only social circle. A few weeks ago, Mr. Murphy and other black preachers led a public protest over the selection of a white schools superintendent, claiming that the school board had failed to consider other qualified candidates. When he got word of the precinct plan in late June, Mr. Murphy said, he figured that it was \u201cpart of the North Carolina Republicans\u2019 push to suppress voting.\u201d He and a number of other N.A.A.C.P. members decided to attend a pair of Board of Elections hearings on the matter. On June 23, more than 30 residents showed up at the indoor gymnasium at Holly Oak Park, a proposed new polling place.Mr. Murphy said that fewer polling places meant that lines would be longer on Election Day \u2014 and that longer lines would dissuade some voters from casting their ballots. Others, he said, might mistakenly vote at the wrong polling place. Such ballots were once counted in North Carolina, as long as the ballot was cast in the correct county. But the new law makes them invalid.Mr. Langley, one of two Republican board members, said he was shocked that anyone would assume that the proposal was based on racial, or even partisan, motives. \u201cEven though I\u2019m a Republican, my duty is to the taxpayers of Cleveland County,\u201d he said.Mr. Langley recently gave a tour of the polling places that would be closed under the plan, including two fire departments. These, he said, were much more cramped than the two sites where voters would be rerouted, both of them big public park buildings where setting up voting machines would be easy, and people would not have to wait outside, he said.Mr. Langley, 53, an operator of a local pest control company, said he did not even know that the county had been freed from the preclearance provisions until the public meeting on June 23. And he could not believe that anyone would be upset about having to show an ID to vote.Across from the Putnam Baptist Church on Thursday, Tina Sydnor, 52, a retired retail worker, said she was worried about the effect of a precinct change on her fellow black neighbors, especially those who had to be persuaded to vote.\u201cIt\u2019s already hard to get them to the polls,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Scores of other families had done the same, food and water were scarce, and ambulances bearing the victims of new attacks screamed in day and night.\u201cWe are living in the dirt,\u201d said Mr. Hillis, 73. \u201cThere is no work, no money, no medical treatment, and everything is decided by those fighting, so what can we, the people, do about it?\u201dThree weeks of war between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza have pushed the territory to the brink of humanitarian disaster. Israel\u2019s military on Tuesday broadened its offensive, bombing 150 sites, and one strike set ablaze the territory\u2019s only power plant, filling the sky with smoke and cutting the electricity needed to pump water and sewage systems as well.As the Palestinian death toll has risen to more than 1,220, including about 300 children, 22 medical facilities have been damaged and 215,000 people have fled their homes.The longer the war lasts, the worse it gets.International efforts to secure even short-term cease-fires have so far failed, and aid groups say indiscriminate battle tactics on both sides have endangered civilians.Even before the war, Gaza\u2019s humanitarian situation was precarious. An Israeli-Egyptian blockade meant to weaken Hamas had decimated the economy, and half the population depended on food aid.This has increased the pressure on Gaza City, originally home to about a third of Gaza\u2019s 1.7 million Palestinians, but now holding many more who have fled the front lines.In the stretches of quiet between the recent wars, Gaza City has striven to be like cities elsewhere, but even its finer areas bear scars. Shattered windows mar beachfront hotels, and Israeli airstrikes have collapsed parts of downtown towers.\u201cOur whole lives have been war,\u201d said Sobhi Salim, 59, sitting with his family in the park of the Unknown Soldier during a lull this week. They had fled the eastern neighborhood of Shejaiya and returned to find their home destroyed, he said, making it unclear where they would go after the war. Three of his nephews had died fleeing the neighborhood, he said, and another had been killed fighting for Hamas.As he spoke, a man with a plastic toy car outfitted with speakers and lights charged small change to give children rides. A fountain that children often dived in for respite from the heat had stopped working and now held a foot of dirty, green water.\u201cThe violence will never bring a solution if there is not a political agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all say, \u2018We\u2019ll bring freedom with the rifle,\u2019 but it\u2019s all empty talk.\u201dEven when the two sides are not at war, Israel has a complicated relationship with Gaza. It insists it has not occupied the territory since withdrawing its troops and settlers in 2005. But it controls Gaza\u2019s borders, sea access, airspace, cellphone frequencies and population registry.A baby born in Gaza gets an identification number only after approval by Israel.The United Nations and the United States government consider Gaza occupied, though Israel does not.Throughout the war, Israel has continued to allow food and electricity into Gaza, complicating Palestinian claims that they are besieged.Ironically, Tuesday\u2019s strike on the Gaza power station will make the territory even more dependent on Israel.\u201cToday there is no electricity in Gaza,\u201d said Jamal Dardasawi of Gaza\u2019s power company.The plant would take months to fix, he said, and eight of the 10 lines that bring electricity to Gaza from Israel have been damaged by the war, leaving only a trickle coming in from there and from Egypt.Mr. Dardasawi blamed Israel for the strike, but Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said Israel had not identified the source of the attack.\u201cI don\u2019t have a clear picture of what happened there,\u201d he said.Israel has said the war is necessary to stop rocket fire by Gaza militants on its communities and to destroy a network of tunnels they have used to sneak fighters into Israel to kidnap soldiers. It blames Hamas for the vast destruction and the high civilian death toll, saying the militants fight from residential areas.But such reasoning angers Gazans, who believe \u201cthe resistance\u201d has a right to fight back against a stronger power and say that Hamas\u2019s battle tactics do not justify razing civilian homes.\u201cLook at where they have forced us to live,\u201d said Mr. Hillis\u2019s wife, Insaf, in the family\u2019s tent behind the hospital. \u201cEvery family here has a son or a father or a brother who has been killed, and all of their children will grow up wanting revenge.\u201dFor many people in Gaza, it is the sounds of Israel\u2019s military that fill their days: the ever-present whine of the drones that monitor movements and fire missiles, the deep thump of artillery fired by warships or troops, and the screech of fighter jets that dot the sky with flares and drop bombs that level homes.The daily tally of rocket attacks, airstrikes and deaths in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.There are also phone calls, in Arabic with heavy Hebrew accents, threatening Hamas members, \u201cWe will hunt you down no matter where you are!\u201dLeaflets dropped over the city this week bore a map of Gaza dotted with graves.\u201cDo you know where the bodies of Hamas and Islamic Jihad elements are?\u201d they read. The back bore a list of dead fighters with a question: \u201cWhose name do you think will be in the next leaflet?\u201dDuring the war, Gazans have heard little from Hamas, other than its television or radio stations, which splice jihadi music with news about the \u201cZionist enemy\u201d and often predict victory \u201cin the next few days.\u201dAs the war continues, most Gazans are just struggling for a safe place to sleep.About 400 people, all Muslims, have crowded into the Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius, where Archbishop Alexios has four rules: \u201cBe quiet, be clean, no problems and no weapons.\u201dThe displaced sleep in offices and meeting halls and string their laundry across the courtyard. When it is too dangerous to walk to the mosque, they lay out rugs and pray in the church.Alaa Sukkar said his family had fled to Gaza City with no place to go and stumbled upon the church, where they had stayed since.A fighter jet screamed overhead as he spoke, and he blamed Israel for the war and said Hamas had to fire rockets to keep Israel out of Gaza.But when asked whether the rockets actually did that, he reconsidered.\u201cThe rockets don\u2019t protect us, and the Jews\u2019 tanks and jets don\u2019t protect them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that could protect us would be peace between us.\u201dFares Akram contributed reporting from Gaza, and Jodi Rudoren from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Corsica, Pursuing Autonomy by Other Means", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeAJACCIO, Corsica \u2014 The good news on the French island of Corsica last week was the declaration by the National Liberation Front of Corsica that it was laying down its arms and abandoning a 38-year armed struggle for Corsican independence.For the more than 300,000 people who live on the Mediterranean island, any respite from violence is welcome. Since 1976, Corsica has been the site of more than 10,000 acts of violence \u2014 almost half claimed by clandestine nationalist groups such as the front \u2014 which included assassinations, armed assaults and \u201cblue nights,\u201d the graphic shorthand for multiple bombings of public buildings and vacation houses.Olive branch or ruse? A sign of weakness or of maturity? Since the June 25 publication of the front\u2019s 14-page communiqu\u00e9, Corsicans have been trying to figure out what to make of the shadowy group\u2019s surprising call for the opening of \u201cnew perspectives in our march toward sovereignty.\u201dAs France prepares to redraw its political map, trimming the number of regions from 22 to 14, Corsica\u2019s special status has again been thrown into relief. If other French regions gain more powers, how will this island, with its history of violent defiance, be able to distinguish itself from the \u201cContinent\u201d?What is clear is that the next battle over Corsica\u2019s future will be mainly fought in the political arena, where nationalists, allied since 2010 with members of traditional French parties, have succeeded in dominating a debate that has put the island on a collision course with the French government.Jean-Guy Talamoni, a leading nationalist, described the political shift. \u201cSomething incredible has happened in Corsica in the last three years,\u201d Mr. Talamoni, the president of the Corsica Libera party, told the newspaper Corse-Matin last week. \u201cThe ideas which we have carried alone for decades as a minority have become mainstream.\u201dThe clearest example was a vote taken at the Corsican Assembly in April, when representatives approved a three-part agenda designed to broaden and deepen Corsica\u2019s autonomous status. The so-called triptych calls for the adoption of Corsican as a second language on the island, equal to French; a five-year residency requirement for the purchase of property; and a reference to Corsica\u2019s unique status of limited autonomy.All three measures have been rejected by the French government as unconstitutional and well beyond the authority of local legislators. Changes to the Constitution require a three-fifths majority of both houses of the French Parliament \u2014 a highly unlikely outcome.Senator Nicolas Alfonsi, a longtime opponent of radical Corsican nationalists who will retire in September after two terms as a representative of southern Corsica, believes the nationalists\u2019 agenda has remained unchanged.\u201cThe nationalists abandoned violence for a strategic choice to proceed by democratic means,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe theme of autonomy is not actually mentioned in the debates, but the proposals which have been voted are a way to get there indirectly.\u201dMr. Alfonsi contends that Corsican politicians are using nationalist themes to advance their own interests. \u201cThere are no collective ambitions here, only personal interests,\u201d he said. \u201cCorsican society is rife with connivance, abstention and the unspoken. It doesn\u2019t reveal itself, and in this scenario, there can be no collective project.\u201dIn the last decade, the rivalry between nationalist groups has morphed into criminal competition over economic interests, including property development and racketeering. Killings and bombings are now more likely to be criminal than terrorist in nature, a blurry distinction that still makes Corsica one of the most murderous regions of Europe.Paradoxically, Corsica, whose economy depends on tourism, has been able to protect its stunning beaches and forested mountains from overdevelopment, in part because of its reputation for violence. But there are better ways to run an economy and protect the environment, Mr. Alfonsi said.\u201cInstead of managing local problems, the debate of the last years has been focused on questions of language, residency and status,\u201d said Mr. Alfonsi. \u201cIn this way, we have created a situation that doesn\u2019t exist so we can propose a virtual solution to solve it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Australian dollar hit a three-week high on prospects of stronger exports to China.A breakdown of the survey showed that most of 11 subindexes that measure output and domestic and foreign demand had improved substantially from June.A subindex measuring new orders, a gauge of demand at home and abroad, hit an 18-month high of 53.7, while the subindex for output also rose to a 16-month high in June.The employment index also improved from May, though it was still slightly under 50, which implies that jobs were still being lost in the manufacturing sector.Any marked weakening in the labor market would raise alarms for China\u2019s government, which regards healthy employment levels as a top policy priority and an important condition for social stability.Premier Li Keqiang said last week that economic growth of slightly more or less than 7.5 percent this year would be acceptable, as long it still led to new jobs and higher wages.China\u2019s economy grew slightly faster than expected in the second quarter, as the burst of official stimulus paid dividends, but some analysts say the recovery appears largely dependent on government assistance.Economists say they believe Beijing will most likely need to offer further support to meet its growth target of about 7.5 percent for the full year, particularly if the already cooling property market begins to deteriorate more sharply.Since April, China has steadily loosened policy by reducing the amount of cash that some banks have to hold as reserves, instructing regional governments to accelerate their spending, and hastening the construction of railways and public housing.A troubled Chinese construction company avoided a landmark bond default at the last minute on Wednesday after it raised enough funds.The funds let the company, Huatong Road and Bridge Group, steer away from what would have been the first public default in China\u2019s huge interbank bond market, where 94 percent of all Chinese bonds are issued.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Family Feud, Uncorked in Spain", "Date": "2014-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut David \u00c1lvarez did not accept the invitation. He had organized a competing event for the same day in his residence in Madrid and had invited many of the same people.According to Pablo \u00c1lvarez, the winery soon began to hear from invitees who were annoyed by the dueling invitations. \u201cWe could do little more than apologize on behalf of our father,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what he did.\u201dBut just as Cinderella\u2019s fairy-tale wedding concealed uncomfortable sibling rivalries, Mr. \u00c1lvarez\u2019s triumph hides a percolating stew of family dysfunction. For the last four years, Mr. \u00c1lvarez and five of his seven children have been locked in a pitched succession battle full of lawsuits and nasty accusations. It\u2019s been called \u201cFalcon Crest\u201d by the Spanish press, the name taken from the 1980s prime-time soap opera set in a Napa Valley winery.As local newspapers publish juicy rumors of a thwarted business coup attempted by the estranged children during Mr. \u00c1lvarez\u2019s honeymoon with his third wife, a bitter legal battle threatens to tarnish all that the family has built.The drama is occurring during a crisis of confidence for Spain, where a boom fueled by real estate has collapsed into a bust that seems to have no end.With more than 25 percent of the working-age population unemployed and thousands of families evicted from homes because they can\u2019t pay mortgages, some people may find entertaining comfort in watching the wealthy self-destruct in the tabloids. But there is a tragic side to the saga. For years, the \u00c1lvarez companies have epitomized the proud legacy of hard work, meticulous organization and personal sacrifice that defines the best of Spanish business. More recently, they have been a model for exporting and internationalization that could point the way for Spain to recover.In the meantime, the family members continue to report, however awkwardly, to the same office building in Madrid.A Gem of WinemakingAt the center of the \u00c1lvarez drama is the small but crowning jewel of the family empire, Vega Sicilia.The winery was a pioneer in Ribera del Duero, now a popular wine region. The area has a short growing season and lime-heavy soil that make vine growing difficult, but it is an environment that has been said to challenge grapes to greatness.The \u00c1lvarez family took over Vega Sicilia when Spain was in an earlier economic crisis and when the winery\u2019s Venezuelan owner, Miguel Neumann, was eager to sell. A friend of David \u00c1lvarez had been put in charge of the sale, and he asked Mr. \u00c1lvarez to find a foreign buyer. Mr. \u00c1lvarez decided to make an offer himself.\u201cMy father bought Vega Sicilia because it was the most prestigious winery there was in Spain,\u201d says David\u2019s son, Pablo, who has been running the winery since 1985 \u2014 three years after his father bought it \u2014 and is one of the estranged children. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been, he never would have gotten into the world of wine. In those years, my father would say that quality has a future.\u201d (David \u00c1lvarez declined multiple interview requests for this article.)As Pablo \u00c1lvarez, 59, gracious and low-key, sits under a vaulted brick ceiling in the winery office, it is not immediately obvious that he is embroiled in a family feud defined by the epic pettiness of a television soap opera. A large man with a languid style, Pablo \u201cgives the impression that he\u2019s timid but he\u2019s not so timid,\u201d says Mariano Garc\u00eda, who was Vega Sicilia\u2019s winemaker for 30 years until 1998. \u201cHe\u2019s more clever than many people think.\u201dThe Vega Sicilia compound \u2014 Vega means \u201cfertile lowland\u201d and Sicilia refers to a locally revered saint \u2014 has the manicured aspect of a private college campus. Original 19th-century facilities sit beside a cooperage workshop and a new production building, built in 2010 for 20 million euros. Vega Sicilia is one of the few wineries to make its own barrels.Vega Sicilia boomed as well. When David \u00c1lvarez bought the company, it was exporting about 10 percent of its production to four countries, according to Pablo. It now exports more than half of its wine to 110 countries. (In 2013, it set a company record for exports, Pablo says, and is on track this year to pass that milestone.) In the 1990s, Vega Sicilia opened three wineries, Bodegas Alion and Bodegas Pintia, both in Spain, and Tokaj Oremus in Hungary. The wine group now has annual sales that have oscillated from \u20ac25 million to \u20ac40 million ($34 million and $54.5 million).Planning a family business succession is often fraught, especially when the business is as big as David \u00c1lvarez\u2019s multinational, Grupo Eulen, and when seven heirs are involved and when the founder is used to ruling like a king. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a dictator, but he was very domineering,\u201d says Mr. Garc\u00eda, the former Vega Sicilia winemaker, of David \u00c1lvarez. \u201cI remember that in meetings no one spoke. No one. One day it occurred to me to point out a subtle difference, and he didn\u2019t stop talking.\u201dOusted by His ChildrenThe \u00c1lvarez family problems began around the time of the patriarch\u2019s third wedding, in late 2009. David \u00c1lvarez had been passing management responsibilities to his children for several years, and his fifth child, Juan Carlos, was running the big company, Eulen, with his father serving as executive chairman. Under Juan Carlos, Pablo says, Eulen achieved \u201cthe best results in the company\u2019s history.\u201dBut the coming rift would become fodder for Spanish newspapers. Among other things, Spanish papers said David \u00c1lvarez\u2019s wedding was tense because the children were displeased that their father was marrying one of his secretaries \u2014 the second time he had married one \u2014 and that his new bride, now 61, was younger than the oldest of David\u2019s children. And newspaper reports said tempers exploded when Juan Carlos dismissed one of his father\u2019s trusted confidants while the patriarch and his new bride were on their honeymoon.Pablo \u00c1lvarez, who confirms that Juan Carlos dismissed the confidant, waves off the story of a honeymoon timing of the dismissal as fiction and says he doesn\u2019t know who originated the tale. But Pablo says it was his father who took the family feud to the media. Either way, he says, the family fracture was a long time in coming and was not caused by the dismissal. (The press office at Eulen declined to comment on the specific origins of the feud, except to say that Juan Carlos had \u201cbetrayed\u201d his father\u2019s trust; Juan Carlos declined to comment.)What is not in dispute is that soon after the wedding, David \u00c1lvarez used his majority ownership at Eulen to force out Juan Carlos and take over management with Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 and Jesus David, the two children who still supported him.In Pablo\u2019s telling, his father, suffering the wobbliness of age, yearned to return to his days of glory. \u201cI believe this is a process that happens in many older people, where after leaving the executive role they want to return to it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe loss of capacity makes them want to again control what they can no longer control.\u201dIn early 2010, David\u2019s five other children \u2014 known as the d\u00edscolos, or disobedient ones, in the Spanish press \u2014 evicted their father from El Enebro, in which they owned a majority of the shares.\u201cDon David \u00c1lvarez was ousted from the presidency of El Enebro by five of his children, who have denied him his rights,\u201d the Eulen news office said in a statement. \u201cIt is common knowledge to all who are close to President \u00c1lvarez that he enjoys an enviable mental health, with a deep knowledge of his business and a commendable sense of duty and responsibility.\u201dWith a business mix of real estate, beef and wine, El Enebro is tiny in comparison to Grupo Eulen, the business services group. But while taking El Enebro from their father didn\u2019t cause great financial damage, it was seen as a symbolic blow. Before buying Vega Sicilia, he had been a janitorial services mogul; afterward, he was a man of culture.\u201cHe often said he wasn\u2019t that known for all his business until he bought Vega Sicilia with its 30 employees, and then he was known all over the world,\u201d said Mr. Garc\u00eda, the former Vega Sicilia winemaker, who then spoke as if he were Mr. \u00c1lvarez: \u201c \u2018I was known nowhere for the cleaning. Now I\u2019m David \u00c1lvarez of Vega Sicilia.\u2019 \u201d\u2018A Lot of Chess Moves\u2019While the feud is an emotional knot of filial and generational resentment, the official battle has played out mostly in court. \u201cIn business, there are a lot of chess moves,\u201d Pablo \u00c1lvarez says.The first was many years ago. When David \u00c1lvarez ceded ownership of El Enebro to his children after their mother\u2019s death in 1986, he designed a side contract that left him with majority voting rights at the company. When he later sued his children, it was the language in that contract that helped him win a decision, in May 2013, that gave him control of the company.The five d\u00edscolos stopped the decision from taking effect by appealing to the Supreme Court. With the ruling suspended, they took advantage of their continued control of El Enebro to engineer a clever deal. In late 2013, the five voted to have El Enebro buy the 30 percent of Grupo Eulen they owned for \u20ac80 million. And they inserted a poison pill in the transaction: They put up 51 percent of Vega Sicilia as collateral, which meant that if David \u00c1lvarez wins his suit and stops the company from paying his five rebel children, they\u2019ll get the winery in compensation anyway.Incensed, the elder Mr. \u00c1lvarez added another lawsuit to the feud and accused his estranged children of using El Enebro as a personal piggy bank. In the face of their \u201cvery likely defeat,\u201d he said in a news release, the five children had engaged in a \u201csurreptitiously hatched maneuver\u201d that would leave El Enebro with \u201cits cash box empty and heavy debts\u201d when he won the lawsuit and returned to its helm.The five children denied any wrongdoing and said in their own news release that they had offered the shares to their father, which he refused.Now, the two sides await a decision from the Supreme Court, which accepted the case in February and is expected to rule next year on whether David \u00c1lvarez can use his voting rights to return to the top management role at El Enebro. It\u2019s possible, however, that winning the case would do little more than confer him bragging rights. Vega Sicilia\u2019s role as collateral in the stock deal could tie his hands. And the five siblings in El Enebro together own 70 percent of the shares, meaning that even if David \u00c1lvarez wins, he may have a hard time running a business against the wishes of its majority owners.\u201cOne thing is to win something,\u201d Pablo \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cThe other is to get power back.\u201dVega Sicilia continues to perform well financially, but its image may have taken a hit. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they are conscious of this, but this problem is having a lot of effect abroad,\u201d says Ms. Mijares, the wine consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for the winery. It gives this feeling of insecurity that doesn\u2019t make any sense, because it\u2019s not like that.\u201d She adds, \u201cThe winery is functioning magnificently.\u201dPablo \u00c1lvarez says he has not spoken to his father or to his sister Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 in several years. Pablo\u2019s brother Emilio occasionally crosses paths with his father at the Madrid office building that the two family companies share uncomfortably. Those meetings are defined by their awkwardness: Father and son say \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cGood day,\u201d and quickly move on.\u201cAs our father has said, the family has disappeared,\u201d Pablo \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cWe\u2019re one part, and we\u2019re continuing down our path. And he is following his.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Capitol\u2019s Partisanship Is Taking Hold in Governors\u2019 Ranks", "Date": "2014-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoNASHVILLE \u2014 When the country\u2019s governors gather twice each year, they delight in excoriating Washington\u2019s political gridlock, holding themselves up as champions of a brand of can-do bipartisanship that is far too scarce in the nation\u2019s capital.The summer meeting of the National Governors Association here this weekend was no different. But behind the self-congratulatory rhetoric about attaining results and making tough decisions is an inescapable fact of political life: The same divisions that have stymied policy making in Congress are increasingly evident in the ranks of the governors.The state leaders scorned Washington for inaction on immigration and transportation funding. But on those issues, and others like education, many of them are just as uneasy about taking potentially controversial stances or are simply as split as their federal counterparts.\u201cI still think the governors do have a pretty good ability to work together on tough issues, but obviously there is more division in the country today than there was then,\u201d said Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, a Republican,\u00a0referring to his first stint as governor in the 1980s.The governors here expressed collective dismay that the federal trust fund that finances existing highway and infrastructure projects will start being cut next month without an infusion of new money, and used the numerous forums at the conference as well as conversations with reporters to nudge Congress toward long-term action on what was historically a bipartisan issue.With many of them facing re-election this fall, though, the governors were just as reluctant to embrace an increase in the federal gas tax to replenish the trust fund as the congressmen and senators who fear taking on such a vote going into November.\u201cI think all the governors on both sides of the aisle feel like this is an impasse that needs to be resolved,\u201d Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican eyeing a presidential bid, said about the transportation issue. But Mr. Christie\u2019s plea was not accompanied by a solution. \u201cSince I\u2019m not in Congress or in the White House, I\u2019m going to let them make those decisions,\u201d he said when asked about raising the gas tax.Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, a Republican, was one of the few governors who seemed at least open to the prospect, but he also did not embrace it. Mr. Haslam did, however, note that since the 18.4 cent-per-gallon tax was last raised in 1993, the cost burden actually has been reduced on motorists because cars have become more fuel efficient.\u201cEverybody says, \u2018I don\u2019t want to raise taxes,\u2019 but they also don\u2019t want to see their bridges fall in,\u201d he said of the political dilemma.It was just as easy here to find governors criticizing Congress (mostly Democrats) and President Obama (Republicans) over immigration, and particularly the influx of Central American children coming over the border. But as with the highway trust fund, they were less forthcoming about how exactly to address the surge in youth migration.Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, a Democrat considering a presidential bid in 2016, perhaps with his party\u2019s liberal primary electorate in mind, spoke out emphatically on the issue at a news conference for Democratic governors. \u201cWe are not a country that should turn children away and send them back to a certain death,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley said.Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut was notably more guarded when it was his turn to speak. Mr. Malloy, who could face a competitive re-election this year, called for treating the migrants in the \u201cmost humane way we can while respecting our own laws.\u201dMr. Malloy added, with not much more clarity: \u201cI stand with anyone who says we should be in a position to protect our own borders.\u201dPerhaps no issue, though, better illustrates how much Washington-style polarization has seeped into statehouses as education \u2014 and specifically Common Core. The education standards were developed by the governors association itself five years ago as a state-based way to better prepare students and address rising international economic competition.But faced with criticism from the left and right, some governors have begun backing away from Common Core this year, and a few states have even dropped the standards entirely. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably political,\u201d lamented Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat, who along with a former Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia, a Republican, devised the standards. So an issue that was held up only a short while ago as a shining example of the governors at their solutions-oriented best has become one more example of the country\u2019s divided politics. \u201cEvery governor will decide what the right thing is for his or her state,\u201d Mr. Haslam, a Common Core supporter, said at the meeting\u2019s opening news conference Friday, standing somewhat awkwardly beside Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, the association chairwoman, a Republican who just signed legislation last month moving her state away from the standards.It was a far cry from the moment in 1989 when 49 of the country\u2019s 50 governors met at the University of Virginia with President George Bush and began developing a set of national educational goals.But rising partisanship and a broader lack of consensus has increasingly become the rule with the governors.When they last met at their regular winter meeting in Washington this year, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a Republican, emerged from a gathering of governors from both parties at the White House to say that Mr. Obama had waved the \u201cwhite flag of surrender\u201d on the economy. That prompted Mr. Malloy to take the microphone and declare Mr. Jindal\u2019s comment to be \u201cthe most insane statement I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201dThere were at least more governors present at that conference. By the time the C.E.O. of Best Buy spoke in the final session here midday Sunday, there were just eight governors seated to hear him. The separate events for donors to the Democratic and Republican governors associations had concluded at that point. Much like Washington politicians, the governors spend a considerable amount of time raising money from and spending time with contributors.Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat and the incoming chairman of the association, sought to look on the bright side: At least their disagreements here did not grow heated. \u201cI looked at the governors, whether it was the Common Core discussion or whether it was discussions about immigration or anything else, I didn\u2019t hear anyone attacking the other side, or diminishing anyone\u2019s character,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Reliance on Chinese Loans May Blunt the Impact of U.S. Sanctions", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 With the latest round of sanctions against Russia, the United States Treasury Department said it had \u201cincreased the cost of economic isolation for key Russian firms,\u201d like the state oil company Rosneft and the banking arm of the natural gas giant Gazprom.The isolation, though, does not extend to the companies\u2019 growing reliance on Chinese lending, a trend in the Russian natural resources industry that will blunt the effect of sanctions aimed at the finances of Russian oil companies.Energy companies form the backbone of the Russian economy. If oil and gas are taken together, they export more energy than Saudi Arabia, and that money props up the military of President Vladimir V. Putin. Rosneft is the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil company, pumping about 4.1 million barrels daily.Given the gigantic outlays for drilling wells and building pipelines in the Siberian wilderness, such companies rely deeply on cheap sources of capital. The Chinese have been willing to oblige.\u201cWe absolutely don\u2019t expect any impact on the operations or finances of Rosneft or Novatek,\u201d another Russian energy company hit with sanctions on Wednesday, said Pavel Kushnir, an oil and gas analyst at Deutsche Bank in Russia.\u201cThere is a possibility the Chinese banks will try to increase the cost of financing to take advantage of the situation, but this is just speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have no impact.\u201dThe sanctions were so narrowly focused that some financial analysts in Moscow saw them as largely symbolic. The broader significance, they say, was mostly an implied threat of broader measures to come, should the crisis drag on.\u201cWhat is most important is the sentiment,\u201d said Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist with BCS Financial Group, a Moscow brokerage firm. \u201cIf the situation doesn\u2019t improve around Ukraine, which doesn\u2019t seem very likely, there could be another sanction. That will affect risk premium around all new debt issues.\u201dThe third round of sanctions did cross a new line by focusing on large publicly traded enterprises in major sectors of the Russian economy. The latest measures prohibit American banks and investors from proffering loans with a maturation of more than 90 days to four Russian companies \u2014 Rosneft, Novatek, Gazprombank and VEB, the state foreign trade bank.The move weighed broadly on Russian stocks. Shares in Rosneft were down 4.3 percent. The Russian Micex, which had climbed back from its losses after the first round of sanctions in March, was off 2.6 percent.And the fallout could prove substantial for some on the new list. Among the eight military industrial companies banned from doing business with Americans was the Kalashnikov Concern, the maker of AK assault rifles and their civilian variants, called Saigas, which are popular in the United States. In recent years, about 30 percent of the factory\u2019s output has been sold in the United States, the world\u2019s largest civilian gun market.The Kalashnikov factory\u2019s parent company, Rostec, issued a statement lamenting the sanctions\u2019 \u201cnegative effect on cooperation between a number of Russian and American companies, and threat to tear apart the common trust.\u201dWhile the latest sanctions are not likely to inflict deep pain, Rosneft and other Russian energy companies may have to get more creative about their financing needs. China, for one, has proved a good source of funds in the past.Rosneft has repeatedly turned to Chinese lending during periods of tension with the West including taking a $6 billion loan from the Chinese in 2005 to buy Yukos assets. At the end of the first quarter this year, Rosneft reported $41 billion in commercial debt owed to mostly Western banks and $25 billion in funds received as prepayment for future oil deliveries, of which analysts estimate about $20 billion is Chinese financing.Rosneft has not disclosed details of the Chinese prepayment agreement, or its upper limit. But Mr. Kushnir, the Deutsche Bank analyst, noted that last fall Rosneft retired some Western bank debt with prepayment funds most likely from Chinese sources, suggesting the terms are at least competitive with commercial loans.During a state visit of Mr. Putin to China in May, Novatek, the other energy company placed under sanctions on Wednesday, secured Chinese financing to build a liquefied natural gas plant at Sabetta on the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic Ocean, intended to supply Asian markets by crossing thawing Arctic shipping lanes. During that visit, Gazprom also negotiated a prepayment for future sales to China.If sanctions widen, though, Rosneft and others may find their position more challenging.Rosneft, Mr. Tikhomirov said, will inevitably pay higher rates if European banks follow the cue from the United States and the company is eventually cut off from the dollar bond market, the most liquid globally.That could complicate a number of Rosneft\u2019s major projects in the works, like plans to drill in the Arctic, and to buy Morgan Stanley\u2019s oil unit. \u201cIt will have to manage its balance by either cutting costs, or deciding not to pursue projects,\u201d Mr. Tikhomirov said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scottish Independence Is Inevitable", "Date": "2014-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionLONDON \u2014 ONE thing is certain: Whatever the outcome, this referendum campaign is changing Scotland irrevocably. Whether the Scots vote yes or no to independence on Sept. 18, their sense of what is possible for this small nation will have been transformed. Reporting on Scottish politics through wind and rain for almost 40 years, I have covered three referendums on self-government. The first, in 1979, offered a modest elected assembly: A slim majority of voters approved it, but the turnout fell short of the threshold required for the proposal to become law. The second, in 1997, proposed a restored Scottish Parliament controlling most internal affairs. That time, there was a resounding yes. Since 2004, Scotland\u2019s blue-and-white Saltire has flown alongside the Union Jack and the flag of the European Union outside the Parliament at Holyrood, in Edinburgh.At this moment, a majority for independence looks unlikely. Opinion polling has found the no vote consistently ahead since last year. Last month, the gap narrowed to single digits, though it\u2019s opened up again.But it\u2019s the smell, taste and sound of this campaign that should warn us that, this time, a no vote will not be the end of the story. Scotland is changing as we watch. The Scottish National Party, or S.N.P., and its leader, First Minister Alex Salmond, have governed this \u201cdevolved\u201d Scotland for seven years. The S.N.P. was always an independence party; its chief rival in Scotland, the Labour Party, championed devolution, but has always opposed full independence.Scottish political loyalties seemed as changeless as Aberdeen granite. So what\u2019s new to me is the attitude I have found typical among longtime opponents of the nationalists all over the land in recent months: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Salmond, and I\u2019d never vote S.N.P. But I\u2019ve had to re-examine my ideas, and I don\u2019t see how I can vote no.\u201dWhere does this come from? In part, from economic confidence. Twenty years ago, postindustrial Scotland was dismissed as an economy shattered beyond repair. Now, even the British government and the \u201cno\u201d campaign admit that Scotland could survive and prosper and be a stable democracy on its own, given wise management of its North Sea oil wealth. The question is no longer \u201cCan we?\u201d It\u2019s \u201cShould we?\u201dThe motives driving \u201cyes\u201d supporters are straightforward. Devolution, as the intermediate arrangement of limited self-government was called, needs to be completed. The situation in which a Scottish government\u2019s revenue comes as a block grant from London is irresponsible. The Edinburgh Parliament should be allowed to set and raise its own taxes.British elections must no longer trample the will of the Scottish people: The Scots are solidly anti-Tory, returning just one Conservative M.P. to Westminster in the last three general elections, yet they are outweighed by southern English voters and regularly have to endure Conservative governments. Scotland should also be allowed to become a full member of the European Union, not a bolt-on to English interests. Add social welfare to those motives. In Britain, it\u2019s not only Conservative-led governments but \u201cNew Labour\u201d ones as well that now seem committed to Thatcherite economics, to the steady privatization of health, education and welfare. Most Scots hate this.The S.N.P. governments in Scotland have tried to barricade the Scottish National Health Service against the market reforms forced on the N.H.S. in England. Many people \u2014 including the former British prime minister Gordon Brown, who is himself Scottish \u2014 have called the postwar welfare state and the N.H.S. the greatest of British achievements. By defending what\u2019s left in Scotland of that legacy, the S.N.P. risks being called, satirically, the most \u201cBritish\u201d party in the kingdom.But Scottish confidence is not only rational. Put it like this: Ever since the 1707 union with England, when Scotland sold its independence for a share in the British Empire, a tiny blue-and-white cell has survived in the Scottish brain that sends out the message: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be grand if only, if somehow...?\u201d For three centuries, inhibitor cells jammed the message: \u201cWe\u2019re too wee, too poor, too thick... are you daft?\u201d But now that \u201ccultural cringe\u201d has vanished, almost without a trace. And the blue-and-white cell is free to transmit. If Scottish \u201cyes\u201d reasoning is not hard to grasp, neither is Scottish \u201cno\u201d reasoning. Some of it is material: People are not convinced that their living standards would survive independence, and would like firmer promises about pensions and interest rates. Some of it is fear for the economic safety of Scotland, turned loose among the giant predators stalking a globalized world.The English media and many politicians explain the independence movement by claiming that the Scots are obsessed by \u201canti-English racism.\u201d My own experiences tell me the exact opposite. Scots, these days, have almost forgotten about England, so fascinated are they by their own country. (This is sour news for the English, who can bear being hated but not being overlooked.) Twenty years ago, a predecessor of Mr. Cameron\u2019s as leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister, John Major, told me that \u201cthis whole devolution idea is loopy. The problem is that the Scots just feel left out of things. I really should go up there more often.\u201dI thought about a retort. But where to start?Only three years after that, amid songs and tears, the Scottish Parliament met in Edinburgh for the first time in almost three centuries. The old Union Treaty started to fall to dust at that moment, a process that is still following its own logic.I shall vote yes this September. The campaign has already taught me that if we don\u2019t make it with this third referendum, there will be a fourth. It\u2019s time to rejoin the world on our own terms.

{"Headline": "Presidents Find Occasions, Far More than Occasionally, for Proclamations", "Date": "2014-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd then there were Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month and National Oceans Month \u2014 also in June \u2014 with D-Day National Remembrance Day occurring on the 6th, Flag Day on the 14th (with Flag Week beginning on the 8th), World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on the 15th and National Day of Making (for innovators) on the 18th.The president released a proclamation for each one, encouraging people to \u201crecognize,\u201d \u201ccelebrate\u201d or \u201clearn more\u201d about each topic.Since the administration of Harry S. Truman, presidents have used proclamations as a political tool to soothe unhappy constituent groups who may feel their needs have not been met in Washington. Mr. Obama has used them throughout his presidency to show allegiance to his core supporters, while also promoting some of his key agenda items.When he released the proclamation for National Equal Pay Day in 2009, he wrote elaborately about his passion for fair compensation, while extolling the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \u2014 the first bill he signed into law.Even now, his team sometimes schedules speeches and events around recent proclamations and commemorative legislation. He spoke at the Cannon Ball Flag Day Celebration at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota during National Flag Week, for instance, where he affirmed his dedication to helping to develop the economy among Indian tribes.\u201cThe problem for presidents is that they face multiple competing interests and they are in a position where they are constantly having to compromise,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, an associate professor of political science at the University of Houston and author of a book on presidential power. \u201cThey are disappointing people left and right. These things are a way to apologize if need be, or to say thank you.\u201dSome proclamations are substantive \u2014 the most recognizable being the Emancipation Proclamation. But most are ceremonial and carry no real legislative weight.A constituent group may have the ear of a member of Congress, who may then rally other members to establish a joint resolution asking the president to issue the document. In the text of most proclamations, the president will acknowledge the origins of the commemorative day, week or month, and it is often because Congress designated that date and requested the president to call for appropriate observance.The current constant onslaught of commemorative legislation has lessened the impact for many Americans, with few taking the time to celebrate the president\u2019s latest cause. While some may find the issues worthy of recognition, only a small part of the population seems to know that many of these specially recognized days, weeks and months even exist.\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of any of those,\u201d said Nico James, 38, of Washington, after learning of the litany of causes that were being honored in June. And would she celebrate them if she had? \u201cProbably not,\u201d she said.Of course there are the successes \u2014 the ubiquitous pink merchandise in October is a helpful reminder of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and February is often dotted with school plays and speeches in honor of Black History Month. But the majority of issues that have been deemed deserving of a presidential proclamation are so specifically tailored to an organization and its interests, they barely register on the national consciousness.\u201cI think it demonstrates a real narrowing and atomization of presidential constituencies,\u201d Professor Rottinghaus said. \u201cThis is a signal to those groups that the president is on your side. They are especially helpful for building a legislative coalition and seeking re-election. It is helpful for building and holding together a party.\u201dThis tactic has been in effect since the first spike in commemorative legislation, when Mr. Truman first came into office. The New Deal coalition was falling apart, and ceremonial proclamations became a way to show disparate groups that he still cared about their problems.In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a single proclamation, honoring Thanksgiving Day. The following year, Mr. Truman issued 31 proclamations, including ones for National Rehabilitation Week, National Farm-Safety Week, Flag Day, Fire Prevention Week and Women\u2019s Enfranchisement Day.There was another spike in the use of presidential proclamations when Ronald Reagan took office. He issued 178 proclamations in 1988, compared with 72 his first year. His administration used the documents to ingratiate themselves with conservative interests, like declaring 1983 the Year of the Bible.Mr. Obama has released 71 proclamations so far this year, roughly on track to match the 150 he released in 2013.But many of the proclamations are pro forma, adhering to requests made via joint congressional resolutions decades before. Loyalty Day, recognized annually on May 1, is an especially potent monument to an unflattering moment in American history. Conceived during the height of the second Red Scare, it was officially authorized in 1958, when some Americans accused of ties to the Communist Party were being ostracized and persecuted.Now, when the president issues a Loyalty Day proclamation, it is a carefully worded declaration of equality and liberty.A simple Google search reveals very few Loyalty Day celebrations still thriving in America, and they are dedicated more to a general sense of patriotism and a celebration of the armed forces.\u201cWe are going on our 65th year,\u201d said Ragan Myers, a board member of the Loyalty Days Foundation in Ilwaco, Wash. They have a celebration that lasts all weekend and includes a parade, a blessing of the fleet, an oyster feed, an honors banquet and many other activities. But even with the celebration and presidential recognition, it can be hard to get people\u2019s attention.\u201cI think that the group that has kept this going is a dying generation,\u201d Ms. Myers said. \u201cWe used to have a royal court for Loyalty Day, when juniors and high school girls would participate. We had to do away with that program because girls have so many other options now. It\u2019s just not something they\u2019re interested in anymore.\u201dWhen asked if she had read this year\u2019s Loyalty Day proclamation from Mr. Obama, Ms. Myers was not aware that there had been one.Advertisement"}

The brawniest 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT may as well dispense with the rest of its official nomenclature: As long as its power comes from the Hellcat, that\u2019s what people will call this car.Fiat Chrysler\u2019s label makes me willing to believe how potent the engine is. But evocative names don\u2019t always deliver. The power of the 4-cylinder in the comparatively humble Dodge Dart hardly lives up to its designation as the Tigershark.Would I have been less disappointed in that power plant had it not worn a name that promised predation in the air and the sea? Tigershark suggests the F-20 Tigershark fighter jet or the fearsome marine beast, gleaming with rows of teeth, a predator that biologists say is one of the three deadliest of shark species, known to attack without provocation.A recent resurgence in the art of naming engines aims as high as the clever engineering that coaxes extra torque and more miles per gallon from the same cylinders. But today\u2019s names have a hard time matching the exuberantly boastful names and images of the past.Jaguar Land Rover recently announced a family of future engines to be called Ingenium. This ingenious moniker reflects the fact that it is no simple increase in horsepower or displacement that distinguishes today\u2019s motive advances, but weight reduction and efficiency improvements. Still, Ingenium sounds like a drug for high blood pressure or low testosterone.Mazda\u2019s family of engines take a different approach to nomenclature: I have only the haziest idea what the automaker\u2019s Skyactiv technologies are all about, but my first impression was that it had to do with energy beamed from satellites.The best engine naming is a form of marketing that mixes the mechanical and biological in old-style American braggadocio. While the model names of cars have melted into primal syllables unattached to meaning or trademark, engines still rev with the spin of techno promise from decades ago.When engine badges began to appear on automobiles before World War II, there was no need for a contrived marketing name; a simple notation like V8 did the job. But increasingly, engine names inspired advertising and sales brochure artists and the craftsmen of exterior chrome. Lincoln celebrated its V12 with beautiful cloisonn\u00e9 badges. The Ford V8 is celebrated in a famous 1937 billboard by the graphic designer A. M. Cassandre called \u201cWatch the Fords Go By,\u201d which is now in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.Like the engines, the names quickly grew more artful and complex. In the Depression mind-set, manufacturers boasted of efficiency as well as of power. For 1939, Ford offered its Thrifty Sixty V8, a downsized version of the company\u2019s popular Flathead. But increasingly names turned toward themes of wind and fire: Super-Hurricane (Willys) or FirePower (Chrysler) and Hy-Fire (Plymouth).The golden years of the names may have been the late 1940s and early 1950s, when Plymouth\u2019s PowerFlow, De Soto\u2019s Fire Dome and Packard\u2019s Thunderbolt were typical. Crosley borrowed Cobra imagery for its innovative copper-brazed engine blocks. Images of flame and flight abound in names like the 1941 Buick Fireball Dynaflash Eight and the 1953 Nash Super Jetfire.There were exceptions: With its Super Flying Scot 6-cylinder, Nash marketing touched on ethnic imagery, evoking the clich\u00e9 of a frugal Scotsman to promote performance with no sacrifice in economy.Advertisements of the 1940s and 1950s showed off the bare engines with brightly accented parts; today, reduced maintenance needs and cleverly designed covers mean that drivers rarely see their engines.Another difference: 21st-century names speak of efficiency rather than power.The term \u201ceco\u201d is everywhere in new names. Words change their implied messages: turbo once suggested sports car power, as in Porsche 911 Turbo. Now turbo is all about fuel savings and a green image, as in Ford\u2019s EcoBoost family.Of course a good name does nothing to increase torque, but carefully chosen trademarks and nicknames over the years have helped carmakers shape their images. Like restaurant menus, engine names illustrate the power of language \u2014 the poetry of even single words, the suggestion that bacon tastes better when apple smoked.Some engines are named simply after their configuration or shapes: the Vs of course, or the boxers of Porsche and Subaru, with their interlocking arms of cylinders like engaged pugilists, or VW\u2019s VR6, with its steep angle instead of the most common 60 degrees of standard V6 engines to fit in smaller cars. And of course sheer displacement numbers can become not only names but heroic names: the Chevy 396, for instance, and the Shelby Cobra 427.The most successful engine brand of modern times might well be Chrysler\u2019s Hemi. Derived from a technical detail \u2014 the configuration of the combustion chambers \u2014 the name\u2019s appeal reaches far beyond the world of autos. Chrysler first began using the term in 1951, but it was during the horsepower wars of the 1960s and 1970s that it became a legend. The company wisely trademarked the term and applied it to a new V-8 that was installed in the 2005 Chrysler 300 sedan and Dodge trucks.\u201cThat thing got a Hemi?\u201d became a much quoted advertising line.During the development of Cadillac\u2019s twin-cam V8 engine in the late 1980s, General Motors says, an engineer surveying a marketing presentation said that the target point stood above the baseline the way the North Star stands above the\u00a0horizon. The phrase was adapted for the name.A less romantic tale holds that the name came from n*, a boilerplate place holder abbreviation used by typists in documents about the new engineHonda\u2019s breakthrough low-emissions CVCC engine \u2014 the abbreviation stood for Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion \u2014 lent its name to a whole car, the Civic CVCC. General Motors marketers made a virtue of its aging 4-cylinder by referring to it as the Iron Duke, suggesting a rugged knight or John Wayne. G.M. was less successful in marketing its Quad 4, an effort to match Japan\u2019s sophisticated multivalve engines.The most memorable engine name ever may be Rocket. The 1949 high compression Oldsmobile Rocket engine was marketed in the 88 Series and was a star of early stock car racing. The bold Olds Futuramic emblem could have been done by Wernher von Braun.But most of all, the Rocket 88 is remembered for lending its name and refrain to what is generally regarded as the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song, written, at least in legend, by a young Ike Turner in the back seat of a Buick on Highway 61 in Mississippi, en route to Memphis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Pillars of a Capital Markets Union in Europe", "Date": "2014-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyWhat is a capital markets union?Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission\u2019s president-elect, has embraced the goal of creating one for the European Union. But so far it is more of a slogan than a set of policy actions. There is no harm in having a catchy term to encompass myriad plans, but the idea needs fleshing out.The first thing is to clarify the goals. One is to finance jobs and growth throughout the European Union. Another is to have a financial system that is better able to absorb shocks.Banks are shrinking and cannot do the job of funding growth on their own. Nor are they good at absorbing shocks. Indeed, they often magnify them, as the credit crunch and euro crisis showed.The solution is to beef up nonbank finance \u2014 including shares and bonds, shadow banking and much else too. Further integration of the European Union\u2019s capital markets will lead to greater critical mass and lower financing costs, as well as soften the blow of an economic shock by sharing the pain across a wider area.The phrase \u201ccapital markets union\u201d is a conscious echo of the European Union\u2019s new banking union. But there are several important differences.One is that although Britain is not part of the banking union, it should be in the capital markets union. The project would not amount to a hill of beans if it excluded the City of London.Another is that creating a capital markets union should not involve the European Central Bank\u2019s supervising the securities markets. Supervision is certainly needed to stop market participants from engaging in shenanigans like manipulating interest or exchange rates. But that can be achieved mainly through the existing national authorities.So what then is needed? There are five main pillars.First, deregulation. The European Union is supposedly committed to free movement of capital. But there are still barriers. For example, nonbank lenders established in one country are not automatically free to extend credit across the European Union unless they get banking licenses in other countries. This gums up the flow of capital. Such restrictions should be removed.Other regulations are so tight that they prevent specific capital markets from developing. For example, occupational pension funds, a huge potential source of capital, are often prevented from investing in long-term infrastructure projects and \u201cunrated\u201d loans. This year, the commission proposed a directive to address this problem.Second, transparency. Capital markets thrive only when there is a good flow of information. But this is lacking in two areas \u2014 small and medium-size enterprises and infrastructure finance \u2014 as a report prepared for European Union finance ministers argued last year.The report\u2019s authors, Alberto Giovannini and John Moran, argued that the European Union needed a credit risk database to connect small and medium-size businesses to the capital markets. Meanwhile, governments should publish information on past public infrastructure projects so that markets can play a bigger role in supplying funds for future schemes.Third, spreading best practices. Sometimes, specific markets have developed well in a few European Union countries but not across the board. For example, private placements, in which debt is issued directly to a select group of investors rather than through a public offer, has taken off in Germany but not elsewhere. Meanwhile, Italy has developed a \u201cmini bond\u201d market, allowing smaller companies to issue bonds.There are many reasons markets have developed in some countries and not others: tax, regulations, laws, business culture and so forth. What is needed is to analyze the causes in detail and then spread best practices.Fourth, standardization. For a single capital market to develop, it is not always necessary to have the same rules everywhere. But it often helps to have a similar approach. Otherwise, investors can spend so much time getting their heads around 28 different rules that they cannot be bothered to invest.Finally, taxes. In most European Union countries, companies have an artificial incentive to leverage themselves up because interest payments can be deducted from their taxable profits. As a result, companies rely too little on equity and too much on debt. The European Union does not have the authority to harmonize tax regimes. But there is increasing appreciation of the damage caused by this distortion, and it will be easier for countries to tackle the problem if they are not moving alone. So the European Union could have a role to play in coordinating change.It is good that Mr. Juncker has made a capital markets union one of his priorities. Now he needs to spell out what he means by it and come up with an action plan for delivering it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs Numbers Raise Questions About Fall in G.D.P.", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Jobs ReportToday\u2019s strong jobs report forcefully suggests that employment growth is accelerating. Payrolls have expanded by an average 272,000 jobs per month in the last three months compared with 210,000 over the last year.To see why, note that real G.D.P. growth equals productivity growth plus job growth (or, more precisely, hours-of-work growth, but that\u2019s close enough for jazz). Rearrange that little equation (See, kids: you do use algebra later in life!), and you get productivity growth equals G.D.P. growth minus job growth.Since G.D.P. was a big negative in the first quarter, and employment has not just been growing but accelerating, it would seem the only way that equation makes sense would be if productivity had totally collapsed: As if the nation\u2019s work force had suddenly forgotten how to make goods or provide services.That didn\u2019t happen, so let\u2019s look at some alternative explanations:Aha! It\u2019s the productivity-killing World Cup Effect! Excellent guess, but your shot hit the pole. The timing is off: G.D.P. tanked in the first quarter, and employment grew faster in the second one.Speaking of timing, since I\u2019m comparing second-quarter job growth with first-quarter G.D.P., isn\u2019t it possible that productivity collapsed in the first quarter and bounced back in the second? Not really. Productivity, or how efficient we are in turning inputs into outputs, doesn\u2019t jump around like that. That\u2019s why the right way to measure it is smoothing it over years and discounting small quarterly changes.Unlike today\u2019s jobs numbers, that\u2019s not a favorable trend, since productivity growth is the main way we generate at least the potential for improving living standards. But this deceleration in productivity growth is tiny compared to the out-and-out decline in productivity implied by the fall in first-quarter G.D.P. and the faster job growth since then.But all that aside, one lesson from today\u2019s report is that the big negative number for first-quarter G.D.P. was clearly an outlier, not to be believed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "V.A. Chief Spent Career Seeking Out Tough Tasks", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMan in the NewsAfter nearly drowning as a child, Robert McDonald was so terrified of water that despite earning dozens of Boy Scout merit badges, he refused to take the swim test to become an Eagle Scout.But during his first year at the United States Military Academy, it was swim or quit, since every plebe is required to jump off a high dive with a weighted pack, boots and rifle. So Mr. McDonald conquered his fear and completed the test.The previous secretary, Eric Shinseki, resigned under intense bipartisan criticism, and the agency was left with such a long list of problems that Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont and the chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, bluntly asked Mr. McDonald at a hearing last week, \u201cWhy do you want this job?\u201dMr. McDonald replied: \u201cIf not me, who?\u201dHis life has been a procession of increasingly demanding leadership roles. After graduating near the top of his class at West Point, he spent five years in the Army, training as an airborne officer and Army Ranger and rising to the rank of captain in the 82nd Airborne Division. He spent 33 years at Procter & Gamble, managing brands like Tide and Cascade, as well as divisions in Asia, before becoming chief executive in 2009. He was deposed in 2013 by investors dissatisfied by the company\u2019s performance.To people who know him well, Mr. McDonald\u2019s willingness to take on difficult assignments may have prepared him to revamp the department, with its $154 billion budget, more than 300,000 employees, nearly 150 medical centers and 800 clinics serving nine million veterans, and offices that dispense pension, disability compensation, cemetery and educational benefits.\u201cBob is focused, highly principled, and he has always been like that,\u201d the acting secretary, Sloan D. Gibson, who roomed with Mr. McDonald at West Point, said in an interview. \u201cHe was somebody that by his mere presence stretched people to be better.\u201dThe Obama administration has brushed off Mr. McDonald\u2019s departure from Procter & Gamble, and portrayed him as a savvy business manager able to bring efficiency and customer service to the department. But it remains far from clear whether lessons from the corporate world will translate to a government agency that must contend with Civil Service rules, intense congressional oversight, aging facilities and a management culture that even the Obama administration has described as \u201ccorrosive.\u201d\u201cP.&G. is going to feel like driving a Ferrari compared to the slow, lumbering bureaucracy that is the V.A.,\u201d said Paul Rieckhoff, chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. \u201cThey can\u2019t fire people. You don\u2019t really have control of your own budget. You got Congressional oversight. You got politics in Washington in general. It\u2019s a dramatically different leadership challenge.\u201dMr. McDonald, the son of an advertising executive who had served in the Army Air Corps, began seeking a letter of recommendation to West Point when he was just 11. Donald Rumsfeld, his representative at the time, encouraged him to keep applying until he was old enough.At West Point, Mr. McDonald distinguished himself as an athlete, scholar and leader, classmates said. He was a \u201cstar man,\u201d wearing the gold stars on his collar that marked cadets with top grades. But he could also rattle his roommates by playing loud records \u2014 memorably the 1973 Charlie Rich album \u201cBehind Closed Doors.\u201d And he balanced academics with the mud and blood of the rugby team, said Jim Abcouwer, a former roommate who is now chief executive of an energy company.\u201cHe was so focused,\u201d Mr. Abcouwer said. \u201cHe needed vents like the rugby field where he could really, really let it out.\u201dIn his fourth year, Mr. McDonald was named brigade adjutant, the academy\u2019s third-highest leadership position among cadets. As adjutant, the 21-year-old handled not only administrative duties for 4,000 students, but also unexpected mishaps, including a 2 a.m. knock on the door before the annual football game against the United States Naval Academy in 1974. The campus police had arrived with a handcuffed man who turned out to be Ross Perot Sr., the business executive and Annapolis graduate, who had broken into the cadet chapel and woken up most of the campus by playing \u201cAnchors Aweigh\u201d on the Army carillon. (The often-told prank was recounted in Mr. Perot\u2019s authorized biography, \u201cRoss Perot, The Man Behind the Myth.\u201d)What should they do with him, the police asked. \u201cWe all deliberated a few minutes,\u201d Mr. Gibson recalled, \u201cand decided to let him go if he promised to leave right away and not come back.\u201dMr. McDonald graduated with a degree in engineering in the top 2 percent of his class, high enough to get just about any assignment he wanted. He chose the infantry. \u201cI think he was looking for a challenge,\u201d said Peter Madsen, a retired brigadier general and friend.But though he was given assignments above his rank and seemed to have a promising career ahead of him, Mr. McDonald left the Army in 1980, when his five-year commitment was up, to take a marketing job with Procter & Gamble.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great Army in the 1970s,\u201d Mr. Madsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s post-Vietnam. I think it didn\u2019t meet all his expectations and he was looking for a different place to serve.\u201dMr. McDonald earned a reputation at Procter & Gamble as \u201cthe fix-it guy\u201d able to turn around bad situations, said David Diamond, who worked with him for five years in the laundry soap division.When Tide powder was losing market share to new liquid detergents, executives turned the brand over to Mr. McDonald, who helped introduce a new liquid form of Tide while also increasing sales of the powder, Mr. Diamond said. After Tide, Mr. McDonald was given other tough assignments, including increasing sales in emerging markets in the Philippines and Japan.The job required him to adapt his brands to his customers. For example, Asian hair, he told a group at the Yale School of Management in 2010, is twice the diameter of Caucasian hair, so Pantene in Japan has more conditioning agents than in North America. Many Filipino families do laundry by hand, so his team developed a single-rinse version that saved time and money.\u201cHe got the tough jobs, anywhere sales were lagging or we were getting outflanked by competitors,\u201d said Mr. Diamond, now an independent consultant.In 2009, he took the helm of Procter & Gamble just as the economy entered its sharpest downturn in generations and consumers pinched for cash passed over the company\u2019s premium products, like Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers, in favor of cheaper brands.As Procter & Gamble profits lagged, big investors began to complain about what they saw as Mr. McDonald\u2019s slow response. He started a $10 billion restructuring plan in 2012, but it came too late to appease some investors. Mr. McDonald resigned in 2013.At Procter & Gamble, Mr. McDonald built ties to members of both parties, donating to influential Ohio Republicans like Speaker John A. Boehner and Senator Rob Portman even as he worked with former President Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation to supply clean drinking water in underdeveloped countries. People who worked with him said he may possess the sort of political and communications skills \u2014 which critics said that Mr. Shinseki lacked \u2014 to lead the troubled agency out of its problems.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t take sides,\u201d said Maggie Wilderotter, a Procter & Gamble director who joined the board around the time Mr. McDonald became its chief executive. \u201cHe takes positions on issues, and that\u2019s extremely important in this world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ferry Deaths, a South Korean Tycoon\u2019s Downfall", "Date": "2014-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 After all the lavish galas in his honor at landmarks like the Louvre and Versailles, the tens of thousands of devotees following his religious teachings for decades, the hundreds of homes and businesses reportedly stashed around the globe, Yoo Byung-eun ended up alone, his body splayed on its back and rotting in the weeds, empty liquor bottles by his side.Weeks before, nearly 10,000 police officers had raided his church\u2019s compound in the largest manhunt in South Korean history, armed with backhoes to dig up underground hiding places, only to leave empty-handed. They had almost caught him once, it turned out, but Mr. Yoo slipped away, hiding in a secret room behind a wall in a distant villa, almost $1 million in two suitcases at the ready.Millions of dollars from the web of companies, including the one that owns the ferry, went to Mr. Yoo, 73, and his two sons, prosecutors say, squeezed from the business through an increasingly perilous set of decisions that enriched his family at the expense of the passengers.Scores of cabins and even an art gallery laden with marble were added to the ferry\u2019s upper decks, making the ship top-heavy. So much extra cargo was crammed on board that there was sometimes no space to secure it properly with chains and lashings. And, prosecutors say, the ferry\u2019s crucial ballast water, needed to balance all the additional weight, was deliberately drained so that the vessel would not sit too low \u2014 a telltale sign to inspectors that the ferry was dangerously overloaded to bring in more money.\u201cIt was a miracle that the ship actually sailed as far as it did; it could have tipped over any time,\u201d said Kim Woo-sook, dean of the graduate school at Mokpo National Maritime University. \u201cFor them, cargo was cash.\u201dFew events in recent memory have rattled South Korea more deeply than the sinking of the ferry, a disaster captured in haunting text messages and cellphone videos from students as the ship slipped into the Yellow Sea.As the ferry first started tilting, some students did not yet grasp the danger, shouting, \u201cThis is fun!\u201d and joking about posting the event on Facebook. But as the ship listed farther, panic spread, with students yelling, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to die!\u201d and recording hurried goodbyes to their parents.\u201cThis looks like the end,\u201d one boy shouted into a smartphone, before another cut in: \u201cMom, Dad, I love you.\u201dReinventing a SwindlerSuch scenes reverberated around the world. Since then, scores of people have been arrested in connection with the sinking, including regulators, the captain, officers and members of the crew. But at the heart of the tragedy, and the investigation into how it happened, sits one of the nation\u2019s most eccentric, and now reviled, families.\u201cThe Yoo Byung-eun family, which is the root cause of this calamity, is inviting the ire of the people by flouting the law rather than repenting before the people and helping reveal the truth,\u201d said President Park Geun-hye, who has also been widely criticized for her government\u2019s failure to prevent the disaster, much less find Mr. Yoo before his death. His wife and two of his four children are now in custody, and one son remains at large.The Yoo family\u2019s representatives did not provide answers to questions about the disaster, their businesses or their church. Many church members have said, however, that Ms. Park is trying to demonize the Yoos to deflect criticism from her government. But dozens of interviews with regulators, Coast Guard officials, prosecutors, dockworkers, crew members and family business associates seem to confirm the prosecutors\u2019 contention that the Yoo family played a crucial role in the tragedy by cutting corners on the ferry\u2019s safety, even as it was spending lavishly on itself.The family used a sprawling group of at least 70 companies on three continents as a personal A.T.M., prosecutors say. In their own names or through companies that they control, family members own at least $8 million worth of real estate in the United States alone, including a condominium at the Ritz Carlton in Manhattan, and have the rights to be an American distributor of Debauve & Gallais, the French maker of luxury chocolates once favored by Marie Antoinette. In France, they own an entire hilltop village.The family also spent tens of millions of dollars to lionize Mr. Yoo, a convicted swindler known best in South Korea in connection with the mass suicide of 32 members of a splinter group of his church more than two decades ago.Hoping to reinvent him as a Zen-like artistic genius, a family business donated $1.5 million to the Louvre, which then etched his new identity \u2014 the pseudonym Ahae \u2014 in gold on a marble wall at the museum. The family inaugurated a worldwide tour of his photos at Grand Central Terminal in New York and spent nearly $1 million to rent space as part of a deal to exhibit his work for months at Versailles, the palatial former home of French monarchs.A sumptuous affair to begin the event, catered by a Michelin-starred chef, drew ambassadors and celebrities like the mother of Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the singer-model wife of the former French president, according to Le Figaro. At a separate concert at the end of the exhibition, the London Symphony Orchestra played, premiering a brand new piece: Symphony No. 6 \u201cAhae.\u201dIn one of their more damning findings, prosecutors say that so much money was being siphoned away from the ferry company to Mr. Yoo and his relatives that it was starved of funds and spent just $2 last year on safety training for the Sewol\u2019s crew members. The money went to buy a paper copy of a certificate.During the accident, the chaos caused by the lack of training was clear. Some crew members readily admitted in interviews after the disaster that they had no idea what to do during the emergency, had never done evacuation drills and made fatal mistakes like repeatedly telling passengers over the intercom to \u201cstay inside and wait\u201d as the ship began to sink, dragging scores of students down with it.The ferry company was able to cut corners so dangerously because South Korea\u2019s system for regulating ferries \u2014 like so much of regulation in South Korea \u2014 is based on trust, riddled with loopholes, manpower shortages, petty corruption and a reliance on businesses to police themselves. The broad, tacit acceptance of lax safety standards to keep the economy humming has been blamed for everything from building collapses to a nuclear energy scandal over fudged testing results that has raised serious questions about the safety of the country\u2019s 23 reactors.Public outrage since the ferry accident has pushed President Park to vow to strengthen safety standards by rooting out what she called \u201clayers of corruption,\u201d including collusive ties between regulators and businesses.Prosecutors and government auditors said Coast Guard officials turned a blind eye to problems with safety checks after they had been taken to the resort island of Jeju, where they were wined and dined by the ferry company. Other inspectors admitted that they eyeballed boats from a distance to see how deeply they sat in the water, effectively guessing whether they were overloaded with cargo.Members of Mr. Yoo\u2019s church, known as Salvationists, say such discoveries are behind the government\u2019s push to investigate the Yoos, saying it hopes to shift attention away not only from its own regulatory failures, but also the badly fumbled rescue attempt of the ferry, which had only 172 known survivors. The accident left Ms. Park\u2019s government in disarray. Her prime minister tendered his resignation, and her approval ratings have plummeted.\u201cIt\u2019s as if all the problems are solved once they crack down on Yoo Byung-eun and the Salvationists,\u201d said Yi Tae-jong, who operates an online archive of Mr. Yoo\u2019s sermons and is a church spokesman. \u201cFrom the days of founding our church, he is our biggest mentor.\u201dGrand Childhood AmbitionsMr. Yoo\u2019s grand ambitions started in boyhood. A sickly child, he dreamed of becoming \u201ca sculptor greater than Michelangelo,\u201d according to a collection of sermons published in 1981. But soon after high school, in the 1960s, he found a new calling: religion.Mr. Yoo\u2019s church, the Evangelical Baptist Church of Korea, now claims to have 100,000 members, adhering to a polarizing interpretation of how Christians reach salvation.\u201cThey no longer have to repent, even if they commit such sins as adultery and thievery; they are lawless people,\u201d said Jin Yong-sik, a Presbyterian pastor in Anseong and an expert on fringe churches in South Korea. \u201cYoo Byung-eun is a cult leader. He is deified as a Moses or a messiah among his followers, and they give him money as he pleases.\u201dChurch leaders dispute the allegations, saying their religion is being vilified despite being rooted in the Bible. One of their tenets \u2014 a focus on health \u2014 appears to stem from Mr. Yoo\u2019s frailty as a child, when he suffered from tuberculosis, and a personal preoccupation with cleanliness. He preached that cleansing the body and particularly the blood could help achieve spiritual purity, and wrote disapprovingly of fellow Christians\u2019 lengthy prayers before meals that allowed \u201clittle white specks\u201d of spit to fall in their food.As Mr. Yoo built his church, he embarked on a second career, as a business magnate. Starting in the 1970s, he turned the church into a source of cash, investigators and former and current Salvationists say, by persuading adherents to donate to or invest their savings in his growing number of companies.Some of his businesses found a particularly captive market in his flock, selling to his followers. In recent years, they marketed products related to the church\u2019s teachings such as green tea and even enema kits to cleanse members\u2019 bodies of impurities.This type of approach gave him a source of cash in an era when South Korea was still impoverished and was just beginning its so-called economic miracle. Money for investment was hard to come by, so by using church members as a source of capital, he was able to build factories and companies at the same time that Samsung and Hyundai rose to prominence, though he never matched their size.By the 1980s, he had built a mini-chaebol, or family-run business group, that over the years has included a dizzying array of products, from a top-selling shark oil supplement and organic milk to cosmetics, auto parts and special paint for nuclear plants.He was recognized as a rising figure in the nation\u2019s business world when the military dictator Chun Doo-hwan visited one of his factories in 1984. Two years later, Mr. Yoo was suspected of using his growing political connections to get into the business of operating passenger vessels, with one of his companies winning the right to run tourist boats on Seoul\u2019s Han River when the city hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics.Even then, Mr. Yoo\u2019s vessels faced criticism for overloading. Once, when his company tried to board more than twice one vessel\u2019s maximum limit of 200 passengers during a busy holiday season, irate passengers almost rioted, said Lee Cheong, a former Salvationist who worked as a crewman on the boat. He said Mr. Yoo watched the melee impassively from the pier.Crashing to EarthMr. Yoo\u2019s ascent was halted in 1991, when he was arrested after the deaths of 32 members of a splinter group from the Salvationists. They were found dead in the attic of a factory cafeteria in 1987; some of them had been hanged. An investigation by the police did not charge Mr. Yoo in connection with the deaths, ruling them a mass suicide that appeared to be a result of loans that the group could not repay.But Mr. Yoo was convicted on charges of defrauding his church members by improperly diverting money to his businesses, charges that he denied until his death. He spent four years in prison, from 1991 to 1995.The prison sentence, and the subsequent collapse of his business group during the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s, were a fall from grace from which few Koreans expected him to recover. But prosecutors say he bounced back quickly upon release and found ways to avoid public scrutiny.First, after his companies went bankrupt, he regained control of his businesses by having his two sons buy back companies from receivership at fire-sale prices after a government recovery program had forgiven much of the debt, government officials and prosecutors say. With his sons and a daughter, Mr. Yoo then linked these companies in a tight web of murky cross-shareholdings that prosecutors contend Mr. Yoo controlled by placing family members and loyal church believers in executive jobs.\u201cThey mixed religion with business, pooling donations from church members to use in buying and expanding businesses,\u201d Lee Jin-ho, a prosecutor, said during a hearing in June. \u201cManagement, key shareholders and even internal auditors were all Salvationists, so there was no system of check and control. If the Yoo family demanded money, the companies complied.\u201dIn a church sermon recorded in 2005, Mr. Yoo exhorted his followers to stick together against what he called continued persecution for their beliefs.\u201cThings are tough for us, and others treat us like rags, but we must remember: \u2018Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad,' \u201d Mr. Yoo said, quoting from Matthew.Prosecutors and financial regulators contend that Mr. Yoo and his family invented increasingly creative ways to enrich themselves. One way was by charging Yoo-controlled companies fees to use some of the more than 1,300 patents and trademarks that they claimed, many of which prosecutors say were a sham. In one case, investigators say, Mr. Yoo\u2019s elder son, Dae-kyoon, 43, charged the ferry company, the Chonghaejin Marine Company, $1.45 million for the right to use the name of one of its own ferries. The other son owned the rights to the name Sewol, the ferry that sank, though it was unclear if he ever charged the company to use it.At the same time, regulatory filings show, the Yoos owned no shares of Chonghaejin, at least not on paper. But the ferry company\u2019s largest stockholder was a shipbuilding business, Chonhaiji Co., that in turn was controlled by I-One-I Holdings, an investment company where Mr. Yoo\u2019s two sons are listed as controlling shareholders. The prosecutors also say that behind the scenes Mr. Yoo acted as the chairman and chief decision maker of the ferry company \u2014 which family representatives have denied \u2014 and earned a salary of almost $10,000 a month.Mr. Yoo was able to operate behind the scenes so effectively, prosecutors said, because the ferry company\u2019s chief executive, Kim Han-sik, was a loyal church member who followed Mr. Yoo\u2019s orders and hid a 10 percent share of the ferry operator for Mr. Yoo under his name. Mr. Kim recently admitted in court that he embezzled $131,000 from the ferry company to pay consulting fees to Mr. Yoo\u2019s brother.Prosecutors say that Mr. Yoo and his two sons, or companies that they controlled, received a total of at least $3.82 million from the ferry company in recent years. On top of that, regulatory filings show, the ferry company spent $2.5 million to buy stakes in other Yoo-affiliated companies, including one that prosecutors say contributed to Mr. Yoo\u2019s art exhibits abroad.But as money was being funneled to the Yoo family, the ferry company was struggling financially, reporting a loss of $764,000 last year, regulatory filings show \u2014 leaving little left over for the kind of training and safety precautions that could have helped crew members respond to the emergency on the Sewol.Artistic Alter EgoOf all the family\u2019s schemes, prosecutors and financial regulators say, the most elaborate involved the photographs taken by Mr. Yoo\u2019s artistic alter ego, Ahae.The Yoos and their associates forced their own businesses, including the ferry company, to buy his photos at inflated prices, pitching them as good investments, prosecutors say. Church members also bought photos, although some followers were skeptical that they would prove valuable in the future, according to Mr. Yi, the Salvationist who is a spokesman for the group.Some supporters championed investing in Mr. Yoo\u2019s photos in the hope that prices would spike. But others, despite their qualms, bought the photos to try to rehabilitate Mr. Yoo\u2019s reputation \u2014 and, by extension, their church\u2019s.\u201cIt has been a long grievance for us all these years, the bias against our church,\u201d Mr. Yi said. \u201cWe had expectations that if Ahae was internationally recognized as a photographer and if people learned that Ahae was actually Yoo Byung-eun, it may help dispel the misunderstanding and prejudices against our church in South Korea.\u201dPreviously unheard of, Ahae \u2014 an outdated term for child in Korean \u2014 seemed to burst onto the art scene three years ago with the series of exhibitions of his nature photos held at famous locations around the world. The exhibit at the Louvre \u2014 in rented space in the museum\u2019s gardens \u2014 was paid for by Ahae Press Inc., a company in New York. Ahae Press was run by Mr. Yoo\u2019s younger son, Yoo Hyuk-kee, 41, who usually goes by the name Keith. The rental of the space alone cost more than a half-million dollars, and did not include the cost of a specially built pavilion.The traveling exhibit, sometimes called \u201cThrough My Window,\u201d featured photos taken every day for four years from a window in Mr. Yoo\u2019s studio in a wooded church complex south of Seoul, according to church members. In a written statement in response to questions, the managing director of Ahae Press, Michael Ham, said that Mr. Yoo took 2.7 million photos from the same window in a project inspired by his prison stay, when he viewed the outside world through a prison window.Mr. Yoo, who in his guise as Ahae cultivated an air of mystery by only allowing himself to be photographed from behind or the side, is described by the website of Ahae Press as a sort of renaissance man: \u201can inventor, entrepreneur, philanthropist, environmental activist, martial artist, painter, sculptor, poet, and photographer.\u201d\u201cThe exhibitions were a way to increase public awareness of the beauty of nature and need to preserve the natural environment,\u201d Mr. Ham wrote. \u201cIn our view, a beautiful and worthwhile endeavor has been distorted and virtually destroyed by false statements and inaccurate media reports,\u201d he said, in an apparent reference to the criticism leveled at Mr. Yoo since the ferry disaster.The company that operated the Sewol ferry, Chonghaejin, was one of the companies that bought Mr. Yoo\u2019s art. In an interview with a Korean magazine before his arrest in May, the company\u2019s chief executive said Chonghaejin had spent almost $100,000 to buy 200 coffee-table books of Mr. Yoo\u2019s photos. Prosecutors said the ferry company also spent $107,000 for seven photos.Other Yoo-associated companies paid even more per photo, they said, with one spending as much as $21,400 each.There is, however, little evidence that the photos have much market value. Art experts, dealers and auction houses said they were unaware of any of the photos\u2019 being sold to serious dealers or collectors.\u201cMy informed opinion as a museum curator for the last 15 years is there is no market for these works at any price. You couldn\u2019t give them away,\u201d said Christopher Phillips, curator of the International Center of Photography in New York, who has organized exhibitions of Asian photography. Speaking of Mr. Yoo, he said, \u201cThis guy has woven together all past Korean scams, both economic and religious, and he\u2019s created a more universal one.\u201dBeginning of TroubleIn the ferry disaster, the Sewol\u2019s troubles appear to have begun with the addition of the extra cabins and the art gallery above the main deck in late 2012, a change prosecutors say Mr. Yoo personally ordered.The task of signing off on the new design fell to the Korean Register of Shipping, a private group that the government licenses to certify ships as seaworthy. Inspectors accepted the changes, but only after setting limits on the amount of cargo the vessel could carry and a clear minimum on the amount of ballast water needed when fully loaded. It also assigned an inspector to ensure the remodeling was done correctly.That inspector is now one of six regulators behind bars. His indictment says he approved the retrofitting without properly conducting an \u201cincline test\u201d to determine whether the renovated ship was stable.The Coast Guard was supposed to check whether he had performed the test properly, but it did not, government auditors and prosecutors say. In an interim investigative report this month, the government\u2019s board of audit suggested the redesign had not followed the approved blueprints and was 100 tons heavier than promised. Much of the extra weight came from the addition of thick marble slabs for the art gallery.The next layer of protection was supposed to come from the Korea Shipping Association, or K.S.A., which checks that ships are not overloaded. Each time ferries leave port, they report the amount of cargo they are carrying to K.S.A. inspectors.Critics of the maritime safety system have long said that the shipping association should not monitor safety because it has a built-in conflict of interest: It is an industry group funded by the shipping companies that it is supposed to monitor.K.S.A. officials in Jeju, the resort island on the Sewol\u2019s route, admitted during an interview in June that inspectors did not leave shore to inspect ships when deciding whether they were overloaded. They argued that shippers deprived them of the money needed to do more thorough inspections.They now admit that looking at the load line painted on the side of ships posed a special risk, because companies could simply mask heavier cargos by shedding ballast water, as the crew of the Sewol is accused of doing. In that case, the tactic proved deadly, removing a critical counterweight needed to prevent the vessel from capsizing.As it was, prosecutors say the company overloaded the Sewol during at least 139 voyages in the 13 months it was in service. In court, some executives and crew members have acknowledged that the ship routinely carried more cargo than it was allowed. Dockworkers say the ship was so unstable that it would lurch badly during loading and unloading, sometimes forcing them to drive forklifts onto one side to hold the boat steady while cars were driven off the other side.On a blustery day in January, three months before the Sewol capsized, the ship\u2019s trouble with balance became glaringly obvious during a port stop in Jeju. Hit by gusts, the ship\u2019s oversize superstructure acted like a huge sail, pinning the vessel to the dock and preventing it from departing. The episode was worrisome enough to company officials in Jeju that they sent a report to their management warning of the ship\u2019s instability, prosecutors say.When company officials decided that the ship was so troubled that it should be sold, their plan was vetoed by Mr. Yoo himself, prosecutors say. Instead, company executives colluded to \u201cload as much cargo as possible, whatever the costs,\u201d according to prosecutors.But there were warning signs well before January.Some dockworkers on Jeju said they held small demonstrations in front of local government offices last year to complain that the ferry company was putting more cargo on the Sewol and its other vessels than it reported in cargo manifests. Their particular complaint was that understating the amount of cargo resulted in less pay for the dockworkers, who are paid by the ton.Ko Do-ho, a 35-year-old member of the dockworkers\u2019 union from Jeju, said he and some co-workers first complained about such loading practices in a newspaper advertisement four years ago, but it got little attention.\u201cIf the problem was corrected when we blew the whistle four years ago, we might not have had the Sewol disaster,\u201d he said.The many ways in which the ferry company cheated came back to haunt the Sewol on April 16, the day of the accident, when all of the vessel\u2019s problems combined in a cascading series of events. As it headed toward the most dangerous part of the journey, a narrow waterway with treacherous currents called the Maenggol Strait, it was burdened with 2,142 metric tons of cargo, about twice the maximum permitted, according to prosecutors.Beyond that, it had only 761 metric tons of ballast water, less than half the minimum required. Then the ship\u2019s helmsman turned too far to the right, more sharply than the five-degree turn that the regular captain, who was not working that day, had recommended because the ship was so wobbly, prosecutors said. Crew members and surviving passengers watched as stacks of cargo containers that had been badly tied down suddenly started sliding, throwing the ship\u2019s weight to one side.Soon after the first Coast Guard rescue boat arrived, it reported that the ferry was already listing by 60 degrees, making its top deck nearly perpendicular to the water. When rescuers clambered onto the exposed right side of the capsizing vessel, they could see the trapped passengers through the windows but could not help them in time because they did not have the ropes and climbing equipment needed for a rescue, said Kim Sae-in, a Coast Guard official in Mokpo, the port from which the first rescue vessel came. \u201cA ship of that size should have taken several hours to flip, not less than two,\u201d Mr. Kim said.Three months later, salvage crews are still looking for 10 missing bodies, and the ship remains where it sank. Since the accident, prosecutors have frozen more than $100 million in assets from the extended Yoo family, including Bentley sedans and more than 200 apartments in South Korea.But in recent years, the Yoo family companies have moved at least $33 million abroad, according to South Korea\u2019s Financial Supervisory Service, the country\u2019s financial watchdog. It, as well as prosecutors, says much of this money flowed into companies controlled by Mr. Yoo\u2019s younger son, Keith, a fluent English speaker who married an American. The Korean authorities have asked their American counterparts to find and apprehend him. His brother, Dae-kyoon, was arrested in South Korea on Friday.The elder Mr. Yoo, who had spent so much time and money trying to rehabilitate his image, suddenly found his photos splashed on posters across South Korea as the nation\u2019s most wanted man. His body was ultimately found in an apricot orchard, near the villa where he hid behind a wall. The police said his corpse was too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, leaving unanswered whether he committed suicide, died a natural death or was a victim of foul play.In the end, the accident that toppled the Yoos involved just a tiny piece of their sprawling empire. Prosecutors say that the practice of dangerously overloading the Sewol over 13 months had earned the ferry company a relatively paltry $2.9 million, or about $9,500 for every passenger who died.An earlier version of a summary and a picture caption with this article misstated the date that the body of\u00a0Yoo Byung-eun was found. It was found June 12, not last week.An article on July 27 about the fall of a South Korean mogul and religious leader, Yoo Byung-eun, over allegations that he and his family bore at least some responsibility for the sinking of the ferry Sewol, which they controlled through one of their many companies, referred incorrectly to the birthplace of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, another South Korean religious leader. Mr. Moon was born in 1920 in what is now North Korea; he was not born in South Korea, though his Unification Church was founded there.Choe Sang-Hun and Martin Fackler reported from Seoul, Alison Leigh Cowan from New York, and Scott Sayare from Paris.

{"Headline": "Creating a Safe Harbor for a Village Heritage", "Date": "2014-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn June, Morro Bay, Calif., set up a community quota fund meant to give small-scale fishermen more equal footing with big-time operators.Sergio Bermudez, left, and Jentry Milhiser, who are deckhands, unloaded shortspine thornyheads on their fishing boat, which was docked in Morro Bay in May.MORRO BAY, Calif. \u2014 Anyone seeking to learn about the fishing heritage of this port city, named for the huge rock that dominates its harbor, need only amble over to the \u201cLiar\u2019s Bench,\u201d a sitting area along the Embarcadero for fishermen prone to telling tall tales. Or one could visit the Morro Bay Hookers, a thriving fraternity of fish-baiters who skewer anchovies and sardines onto hooks for a living, some 400 hooks per line.Although this city of 10,370 has become a haven for retirees and tourists, commercial fishing remains Morro Bay\u2019s symbolic heart and a mainstay of its economy. Ever since the commercial fishery was declared a federal economic disaster in 2000, fishermen in this coastal community of lazuline waters midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco have fought to hang on to their historic livelihood.Faced with increased competition from corporate fish processors in bigger ports, fishermen here have joined forces with scientists and civic leaders to determine their own fate. In June, Morro Bay became the first community on the West Coast to do what their brethren in Cape Cod have already done: set up a community quota fund meant to give small-scale fishermen more equal footing with big-time operators.With Americans eating most of their seafood from foreign waters, quota funds are an effort to keep fishermen near their home fishing grounds. The idea, which is also being adopted by Monterey and Fort Bragg up the coast, is to make fishing financially viable and accessible to a younger generation.The funds are a response to a federal management policy started in 2011 that allocates fishing rights for individual species. In essence, the new system created property rights for fishermen that can be bought, sold or traded depending on a fisherman\u2019s desired catch.But as fishing rights have become a salable commodity, dealt through specialized commercial fishing brokers, small ports like Morro Bay have become increasingly concerned that quota assigned to local vessels could leave the community. The fear is that, little by little, boat by boat, the port\u2019s historic fishing heritage could be gobbled up by the highest bidder, with fishing rights consolidated into larger vessels in ports with mightier market power than Morro Bay.That is where the community quota fund comes in.At the dock the other day, Rob Seitz, 47, one of the first fishermen to take advantage of the fund and now its president, was unloading rockfish, the signature fish of Morro Bay. Some 70 rockfish species flourish along the Pacific coast, many bearing moblike monikers like rougheye, thornyhead, sharpchin and shortraker.Mr. Seitz, a father of four, grew up fishing in Alaska. Although he skippered boats for 13 years in Astoria, Ore., a major port with two large industrial processing facilities, he did not own the vessels he worked on, and once lost his job when one of the boats was sold. \u201cWhat it showed me was that without ownership, I had no stability,\u201d he said.He stuck it out, eventually hearing about a boat for sale in Morro Bay. To buy it, he said, he needed a loan, and to qualify for a loan, he needed access to affordable quota. \u201cI\u2019m not in the tax bracket where I can have boats for fun,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a fisherman, a boat\u2019s no good unless you have the fish to catch with it.\u201dThe Morro Bay fund\u2019s fishing rights were originally owned by the Nature Conservancy, which nine years ago started buying up the permits and boats of beleaguered fishermen wanting out of the business. \u201cWe realized we had to work with fishermen to achieve conservation,\u201d said Michael Bell, the director of the conservancy\u2019s California Coastal and Marine Program. \u201cThat was a big experiment for us.\u201dTogether, the conservancy, fishermen and scientists began exploring ways to harvest groundfish sustainably, using gear such as hook and line and traps to replace bottom trawling, a practice that devastates the marine environment and indiscriminately kills large numbers of nontargeted species, known as bycatch. Half the income from the new Morro Bay Community Quota Fund will be used for further research into sustainable fishing practices.The goal of the fund is to make quota more affordable by leasing it, which is cheaper than buying. Mr. Seitz, for instance, leases quota for 12 cents a pound for the right to catch 100,000 pounds of petrale sole a year, for a total of $12,000. If he bought quota on the open market, he said, he would pay 50 to 60 cents a pound, or $50,000 to $60,000, with no guarantee that the price would not skyrocket the next year.\u201cIt\u2019s not a magic bullet,\u201d Dean E. Wendt, a biologist with the Center for Coastal Marine Sciences at California Polytechnic State University in nearby San Luis Obispo, said of the quota fund. \u201cBut it helps solve a critical problem: small communities over time losing fishing as a practice.\u201dAt the dock in Morro Bay on a recent evening, the topic of the hour was not quota but a spectacular killing \u2014 specifically, a young gray whale savaged by a pod of orcas \u2014 within eyeshot of multiple witnesses.Joseph Conchelos, a 31-year-old fisherman, had just returned from a two-day trip, docking his vessel by the city\u2019s homey harbor headquarters, where a list of \u201cNotable California Tsunamis\u201d and \u201cWanted\u201d posters for stolen vessels are prominently displayed.Mr. Conchelos, a fisherman\u2019s son, served in the Army in Iraq and was wounded by shrapnel. (\u201cI zigged when I should have zagged,\u201d he explained.) What kept him going during his three surgical operations, he said, was the prospect of \u201csoaking a line.\u201d The day he got home, he went tuna fishing.Although not yet part of the quota fund, he is proud of the freshness of his local catch, showing off a California king salmon with nary a nick on its glistening scales.Like many fishermen here, he is hardly fazed by gale warnings and other hardships of the fishing life. \u201cI get to see whales, sea lions and awesome pieces of coastline,\u201d Mr. Conchelos said of his job. \u201cI get to do things and see things on a daily basis that people don\u2019t see in their whole lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workout Clothes With High-Tech Twist Sell Briskly", "Date": "2014-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGym shirts made of Kevlar. Underpants featuring \u201canti-odor technology.\u201d No-sweat briefs. Lycra made of corn. And exercise shorts designed with Cordura, a rugged material most often associated with things like car seats and luggage.As outfits based on yoga pants have become increasingly popular as streetwear, and have even infiltrated the office in recent years, the sale of athletic apparel has exploded.Two main strategies have emerged in this competition for market share during a time of consumer caution. Some retailers employ the simplest angle, vying to offer the lowest possible price for leggings or gym socks. Others have started an arms race to offer the newest, most high-tech garments as often as possible.\u201cEvery season now, or at least two or three times a year, they\u2019re looking for some new story,\u201d said Bob Kirkwood, executive vice president for technology and marketing for Invista Apparel, a company that creates and tests high-tech fabrics in partnership with many major brands. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the way they\u2019ve constructed the fabric, whether it\u2019s a new fiber, or it\u2019s a new treatment on the fabric, that\u2019s the expectation they\u2019ve set.\u201cI have two daughters, and their closets are full of Lululemon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure they could find their way to a yoga place.\u201dClothing sales have been strained on several fronts in recent years, buffeted by a rough economy and stiff competition for a shopper\u2019s discretionary dollars from high-tech gadgets like mobile phones. Over the 12 months that ended in May, apparel sales rose a feeble 1 percent over the same period a year earlier, according to the NPD Group, a market research company.Workout clothing stands apart, snapped up at a brisker pace. Sales of activewear jumped 8 percent in the same period, becoming a $33.4 billion business.But how many pairs of sweatpants does one person need? That is where Kevlar fits in.\u201cDo you really need more toothpaste if you already have some?\u201d asked Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD. \u201cBut if I can convince you that with this toothpaste, you\u2019re not going to get any cavities and that your teeth will last 150 years, you\u2019ll buy it.\u201dAlong the same lines, Mr. Cohen said, \u201ceven if you have workout wear, you\u2019ll want this workout wear because it\u2019s better.\u201dBeginning in 2015, Reebok will offer tops, bottoms and footwear with Kevlar \u2014 most commonly known for its use in flak jackets, which are not usually worn while doing squats. Cordura, which you might find on the seat of a car, was released this month.Chris Froio, vice president for training at the company, said the new garment fabrics were geared toward activities like cross-fit training.\u201cLighter and stronger is what we\u2019re looking at,\u201d said Mr. Froio, explaining that after spending real money on a shirt you plan to sweat in, you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about wearing it out on weights or in the wash. \u201cIf everyone is using the same types of yarns and the suppliers, the one key thing you need to do is have a unique selling point, something simple to understand that provides a benefit the consumer really values.\u201dLululemon has been using a technology it calls Silverescent for several years, which executives enthusiastically describe as \u201canti-stink.\u201d While it does not promise to keep you smelling like peaches while running a marathon, the company claims that materials in the thread kill odor-causing bacteria in the garment itself.\u201cYou can wear this thing over time and it will not smell,\u201d said Felix del Toro, senior vice president and head for men\u2019s design at the company. \u201cEven if he didn\u2019t wash it, after 24 hours, it wouldn\u2019t smell.\u201d\u201cObviously, we advocate washing,\u201d he added quickly. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan.\u201dAlready available in a variety of products, including collared shirts, Lululemon will start selling anti-odor socks this fall.To lure customers back for the next, latest thing, retailers are speeding up the rate at which new fabrics appear and old ones are enhanced. For example, beginning this season, Lululemon\u2019s men\u2019s line will introduce something new in its fabrics every season, Mr. del Toro said. And Nancy Green, the general manager of Athleta, an arm of Gap, said that the company introduced some new or updated material every season.\u201cWe\u2019re constantly introducing new fabrics,\u201d she said. \u201cOur pace is picking up.\u201dIn many cases, these fancy fabrics are protected by patents, owned by companies that develop them, like Invista, which holds a patent on a chlorine-resistant additive aimed at making swimsuits last longer. Apparel brands more typically hold design patents than patents on the technical side, according to Susan Scafidi, who teaches fashion law at Fordham University. Lululemon has developed a reputation for aggressively patenting its wares, she said. It has 36 approved or pending design patents and three utility patents to protect new inventions or materials.In other cases, the exclusivity of a fabric depends on tightly held information. For its Silverescent technology, Lululemon has an exclusive deal with Noble Biomaterials to use the company\u2019s proprietary X-Static technology in its athletic clothes. The way X-Static is made is a trade secret.High-tech threads are not confined to athletic wear. The Duluth Trading Company also sells Armachillo work shirts and cargo shorts, which help keep the wearer cool by pulling moisture away from the body. (Arma-chill-o. Get it?) Betabrand sells a hoodie that transmits music from headphones through the sweatshirt\u2019s material, without any attendant muffling.\u201cYou dry it to a protein powder that looks sort of like flour,\u201d she explained. \u201cThen imagine a machine that looks like a big noodle machine. Add the flour, add some water again, then you have the dough,\u201d which then gets forced through holes that are thinner than a strand of a hair.Qmilk fibers are resistant to bacteria and fire, Ms. Domaske said, and because the process relies essentially on just milk and water, the result is compostable. She says the strands feel like silk.And you can eat it.\u201cI\u2019ve been eating it with strawberries,\u201d she said.Everyone\u2019s favorite question, often accompanied by sniffing the fabric, is less complex. No, she said, it doesn\u2019t smell. The product has yet to reach the market, she said, adding that the business was increasing its production capacity.Of course, many high-flying technologies in athletic apparel have fallen splat on the pavement in recent years after making all sorts of big promises.In light of such disappointments, maybe skepticism should hold more sway. Or maybe not.Anders Jahr, a well-muscled tourist from Norway, doubted that compression technology, which is supposed to provide muscle support, worked, as he stood in an Under Armour store in Manhattan.\u201cBut I bought it anyway,\u201d he said, smiling as he pulled a black compression T-shirt out of a red shopping bag.The shirt cost $44.99.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putting the \u2018Oh!\u2019 in Patio", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PragmatistThere\u2019s a fine line between pragmatism and masochism, and I just crossed it.A few weeks ago my wife and I were lamenting the dearth of useful space in our backyard, and we came up with two options: expand our tiny deck or build a patio.Our local health department nixed the former because of our septic-tank setback guidelines, so I told a few landscaping experts I might tackle a patio project with the help of my wife, Karen.David Christensen, an owner of Christensen Landscape Services in Connecticut, looked at me with an arched eyebrow and said, \u201cYou sure you want to do that?\u201dAmber Freda, the owner of Amber Freda Home & Garden Design, said: \u201cThat\u2019s not something I\u2019d do on my own. It\u2019s intensely hard work.\u201dChris Peterson, lead editor of Black & Decker\u2019s book \u201cThe Complete Guide to Patios & Walkways,\u201d said: \u201cIt\u2019s doable. But it\u2019s a lot of work.\u201dWork? Work is easy!After absorbing my advisers\u2019 counsel, enduring one full week of punishing work and putting Karen through a weekend of intense muscle strain, I can attest to the fact that a modest-size patio \u2014 10 by 15 feet \u2014 is indeed doable, as long as you start off by getting a few things.First, get your head examined.The second thing to get is a multitude of muscle, spread out over at least two bodybuilder friends who owe you a huge favor. Ideally, one of those friends will own a truck, and the other will own a skid-steer machine, like a Bobcat. If not, you should consider renting one of each, or finding more friends to help carry the load.Beyond that, you\u2019ll need a good wheelbarrow, tape measure, shovel, level, line level, masonry string, a framer\u2019s square, PVC piping, two long two-by-fours, a rubber mallet, a rented plate compactor and an economy-size bottle of ibuprofen, among other things.A good book, like Mr. Peterson\u2019s, is highly useful in covering the dozens of steps and technical nuances that can affect the final product. It also covers materials and procedures for specific patio varieties.The core job involves little more than digging and carting many hundreds of pounds of earth and filling the hole with tons (literally) of rock, sand and some sort of flat, hard surface.No one said it would be easy, but here are the tools that make it possible.Amid the grunt work, you will also encounter some carpentry, some mathematics and a fair bit of design.If, like me, you make the big mistake of watching D.I.Y. videos sponsored by companies who sell patio supplies, you may be seduced into thinking you can do the job in a weekend. And maybe you could, too, if you had a team of experienced masons working alongside you.Don\u2019t be fooled. For my patio, I was responsible for lifting and moving almost 13 tons of material, including well more than one ton of soil, five tons of gravel, one ton of sand, four tons of bricks for a retaining wall and almost two tons of pavers.Because my patio site was sloped, I needed around 50 percent more gravel than similar-size patios, but whatever. Try moving even eight tons of material in one weekend, let alone crafting and shaping the material properly. Then enjoy working from the E.R. on Monday.Also, bear in mind that even if you have materials delivered to your driveway, you will need to move everything to your patio site. My backyard is 30 paces from my driveway. So do as Mr. Peterson suggests, and spread out the work over a couple of weekends, at least.You can save yourself added grief by paying for delivery. I spent at least seven hours carting pallets of pavers and truckloads of masonry sand and unloading it all with a Bobcat. I also used the Bobcat to move the gravel that was delivered to my driveway by a monster dump truck. (I paid $200 for that delivery.)Bobcats aren\u2019t for everyone, of course. Rental companies in my area offered them for around $300 a day, and I have no question the machine saved my back and my sanity.But if you go this route, study the company\u2019s online training resources and get a friend with some experience to guide you at the start. As with any heavy machinery, it has great destructive potential to match its productive potential, and mistakes can be fatal.When choosing patio surfaces, consider concrete pavers or granite or bluestone in consistent thicknesses. Natural stone is sometimes sold in varying thicknesses, though, and setting these stones at a consistent level can be frustrating in the extreme, so beware. On Ms. Freda\u2019s recommendation, I chose concrete pavers that look similar to bluestone but come in consistent shapes. (I used the Bradstone line, from Nicolock, which features contours and flaws that you would find in natural stone.) As for designs, Ms. Freda said I should ideally choose a site that requires less digging, but I had no options on that front.Finally, think about color: \u201cWhat\u2019s around it? A little contrast might be nice,\u201d she said. Gray and lilac worked for us.Mr. Peterson said simpler patio shapes are better for beginners because curves often require cuts, and cuts often require extra tools, skills and profanity. A 10-by-15-foot rectangular patio is a good size for a beginner with a big backyard, he said. If you have a simple shape, when you select stones ask the salesperson if the stones come precut in dimensions that might allow you to lay out an entire patio without cutting.Our layout worked out well, mostly by chance. Our pavers came in four sizes, all with squared-off edges, and they fit almost perfectly in our rectangular space. Mr. Peterson said some manufacturers sell kits for shaped patios, and the stones are all numbered according to their place in the layout.Before digging, call 811 to have your utility companies clear your plan. But even then, Mr. Christensen said, homeowners should use extreme caution, especially if your home was occupied before you. If previous owners added underground power lines for backyard lights, he said, such lines may escape a utility company\u2019s notice.After you get the O.K. to dig, schedule your days carefully. I budgeted two days for digging, one for filling the hole and one for laying the stones, and this was lunacy. I actually needed seven days altogether.It took two days to design the layout, build the batter boards, set up the guide strings and mark the so-called \u201cstory pole.\u201d (The batter boards are U-shaped braces that hold the guidelines and can withstand the inevitable kicks and bumps from people and wheelbarrows. A story pole shows you the depth of the surface in relation to your guide strings, so you know how much material you\u2019ve added with each successive layer.)After that, I needed two days to dig. Mr. Christensen said he devotes two days and two full-time employees to make a hole like mine, but I hurried and my body paid dearly for it. My advisers suggested digging at least six inches deep, which accommodates four inches of compacted gravel, one inch of sand and the depth of the pavers. My pit of despair averaged eight inches deep because it\u2019s on a slope, so the back of the pit needed to be deeper than the front.If you don\u2019t pay for delivery, allot one day to gather materials and rest.Next, devote one day to hauling and spreading gravel and compacting it, and spreading the sand. These are tricky steps because you must strive for an even surface with a slight slope so water runs off. Mr. Christensen suggested a slope of one-quarter-inch for every foot, while others say a more gradual slope will suffice. Before pouring sand, place PVC pipes a few feet apart on the packed gravel surface. Then cover the pipes with sand and drag a long two-by-four across the top of the pipes, thereby leaving a one-inch layer.I would then allot one day for placing the stones \u2014 using thin scrap wood for spacers between pavers \u2014 and for pouring and sweeping sand atop the pavers and into the gaps and bracing the pavers with edging brackets. Some recommend filling the paver gaps with polymeric sand, which creates a bonded surface between pavers. My advisers disagreed on its effectiveness, so we\u2019re leaving it out for now.Our biggest mistake was not accounting for the added work and expense of a patio built on a sloped surface. The added digging was a bear, but Mr. Peterson said the slope of our patio and the surrounding area might eventually force our patio stones downhill. So while we had all our machinery and materials, we decided to build a short retaining wall. Mr. Christensen said I might have been able to get away without the wall, and I may yet have to modify it. (If the wall\u2019s gaps won\u2019t let enough water pass, I will perforate the blocks with a drill.) But once this is done, I\u2019d rather not worry about it.A 20-foot wall, 14 inches high and topped with 3-inch capstones, added roughly $700 to the project. Combined with the roughly $1,700 spent on pavers, gravel, compactor, sand, supplies and Bobcat rental, the total was around $3,000.Mr. Christensen said we saved around $2,000 by doing it ourselves. Great. Am I happy with it? Absolutely. Would I do it again? Not in a million years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eurozone Banks More Open to Lending, Survey Shows", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Banks in the eurozone are more willing to lend to businesses for the first time in seven years, a survey by the European Central Bank showed on Wednesday, raising hopes that one essential component of economic growth could be starting to recover.Bank officials surveyed by the central bank in late June and early July said they had eased the standards they apply when considering loans to business. It was the first time the survey showed an easing of business loan standards since 2007, the central bank said.Lenders also reported more demand for loans from businesses and households, while, on average, banks cut the interest rates they charge, the quarterly survey showed. And bank loan officers who were surveyed said they expected conditions for lending to continue to improve.A dearth of credit has been one of the main obstacles to growth in the eurozone. Smaller and midsize businesses, in particular, have had trouble borrowing money to finance expansion and hiring, contributing to near-record unemployment of 11.6 percent.The central bank has struggled to restore the flow of credit, cutting its main interest rate to a low of 0.15 percent and offering banks cheap loans if they lend the money to small and midsize enterprises. But market rates in countries like Italy and Portugal have remained high because many banks were already burdened by problem loans and fearful of taking on more risk.In the most recent lending survey, Italy showed the most marked improvement in the availability of business loans among the largest eurozone countries, according to the central bank.The results of the survey are likely to reinforce expectations that the central bank will not take further action to stimulate the eurozone economy when it meets Aug. 7.The central bank cautioned that loans remained hard to get even if there were tentative signs of a turnaround. \u201cIt has to be kept in mind that the level of credit standards is still relatively tight,\u201d the bank said in a report published on Wednesday.There were also differences among eurozone countries. For example, demand for business loans rose in Germany and Spain but fell in France, the country many economists worry about most because of stagnant growth and political resistance to change.Banks have often said that the main problem in the eurozone is not lack of credit but lack of customers who are confident enough about future business prospects that they want to take out loans.\u201cThe differences between member states \u2014 Germany and Spain on the one hand and France on the other \u2014 underline that some countries are better placed than others to benefit from the global recovery,\u201d Tom Rogers, an economist who advised the consulting firm Ernst & Young in Britain, said in an email.In another sign of eurozone recovery, Spain\u2019s economy grew 0.6 percent, more than expected, in the second quarter from the first quarter, the National Statistics Institute said on Wednesday. Spain was one of the countries hardest hit by the eurozone debt crisis, but has taken steps to improve its economic performance, like making it easier for businesses to hire and fire.\u201cThe painful reforms in the euro crisis countries have not led to a downward spiral, as many had maintained, but have laid the foundations for economic recovery,\u201d Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients on Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Committee Takes Step Toward Renewing Highway Trust Fund", "Date": "2014-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House Ways and Means Committee released a bipartisan plan on Tuesday that would provide federal financing for transportation projects through May 15, 2015, and would be the first step in replenishing the Highway Trust Fund, which will run out of money next month unless Congress acts.The proposal, which would be financed in several unusual ways, is expected to generate about $10 billion to keep the Highway Trust Fund from becoming insolvent on Aug. 1 and to pay for projects the fund does not cover. The committee will begin work on the bill Thursday. \u201cAnd while it doesn\u2019t provide as much funding as I would like \u2014 enough to get through the end of next year \u2014 it does give Congress and the tax-writing committees ample time to consider a more long-term solution to the Highway Trust Fund,\u201d the committee\u2019s chairman, Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, said in a statement. Senators announced separately on Tuesday that they were close to a short-term deal to shore up the highway fund. That announcement could come as early as Wednesday morning.The House plan would be financed through a financial maneuver known as pension smoothing, which increases tax revenues by allowing companies to delay tax-deductible pension contributions, and by unspecified user fees. Money would also be transferred from a fund that is used to clean up leaky underground storage tanks.Fearing their projects will be left unfunded, states have been shifting money to the most urgent road and bridge repairs, holding off on awarding contracts for other projects, and in many cases delaying work as they prepare for financing to dry up.The Highway Trust Fund was established in 1956 to finance the Interstate Highway System. It is financed by a gasoline tax, which is set at 18.4 cents per gallon and is not indexed to inflation. The tax has not been increased since 1993, and the rise of hybrid vehicles and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks has also caused the tax revenues to fall.But with little appetite for tax increases in the House, lawmakers have wrangled for years over the best way to finance the nation\u2019s major road, bridge, rail and aviation projects. Time is running short. The House is 15 days away from its five-week summer recess. If Congress is not able to reach an agreement before then, federal highway funding will be cut by 28 percent on Aug. 1, about the time that construction season starts in most states.Aubrey L. Layne Jr., the state transportation secretary in Virginia, said the state\u2019s cash reserves would finance projects for only about 90 days if the Highway Trust Fund were to dry up.\u201cBut in about 30 to 45 days, we should have to start delaying some projects,\u201d Mr. Layne said. Virginia gets about $1 billion a year from the federal government for transportation projects.Kevin Gutknecht, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said the state can finance its entire lineup of road and bridge repairs for the rest of the year, \u201cbut obviously we are worried about the long-term effects if Congress doesn\u2019t do anything to address the problem.\u201dWyoming has the authority to borrow up to $100 million from the State Treasurer\u2019s Office if federal financing is slowed up, said Del McOmie, chief engineer at the state\u2019s Department of Transportation. Mr. McOmie said the borrowed money would allow Wyoming to pay contactors to continue the repair and construction work.\u201cBut it will stress our borrowing authority if it gets beyond November,\u201d Mr. McOmie said.The trust fund provides California with about $3.2 billion a year for its transportation projects, but officials said California had enough cash on hand to keep up work through at least the end of the year\u201cWe can only do so with the assurance that the federal government will continue to honor commitments made to projects already underway,\u201d Vanessa Wiseman, a spokeswoman for the Caltrans, the state transportation agency, said in an email.Many state transportation officials said that even a short-term disruption in financing would have an impact on roadwork.Beyond the loss of jobs and the cost of restarting work after a delay, officials said vendors\u2019 contracts may force states to pay millions of dollars if work is stopped.\u201cThere are severe penalties that are built into the agreements,\u201d Mr. Layne said. \u201cVendors may have bought materials like concrete that they haven\u2019t used, and we would be on the hook for that.\u201dThe Obama administration warns that the trust fund\u2019s insolvency could put 700,000 workers out work just as it appears that the economy is starting to rebound. The administration wants a long-term solution.Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, a former mayor of Charlotte, N.C., has lobbied Congress for a four-year spending plan that would allow state and local governments to begin work on longer-term projects that cannot be squeezed into a limited time frame.\u201cWe\u2019ve had 18 short-term measures in the last five years,\u201d Mr. Foxx said. \u201cThe cumulative effect of short-term measures is that the country is grinding to a halt.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Our Mismeasured Economy", "Date": "2014-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTODAY\u2019S polarized debates about the role of government often boil down to a single issue: the size of government compared with the size of the overall economy, as measured in gross domestic product.This is true on both sides of the debate. One recent proposal featured in The Wall Street Journal argues for a \u201cgolden fiscal rule\u201d that the size of government as a percentage of G.D.P. should always be shrinking; liberals frequently cite the higher ratio of government spending to G.D.P. in many European countries.But such comparisons are not very meaningful: The way we measure government\u2019s role in the economy is limited, inaccurate and unrealistic. If we want to understand how government and the overall economy interact, knowing the size of government tells us little if we are not measuring how government activities contribute to our economy over time.The problem is that most government goods and services are provided free, so they do not have market prices like, say, mouthwash or financial planning. Standard national accounting \u2014 in G.D.P. and related economic indicators \u2014 addresses this by assuming that the value of government is exactly equal to what government spends, without any consideration of what government actually produces or of the value of this public output.In a report released by my organization, Demos, this week, we make the case that, in at least four critical ways, this G.D.P. framework ignores or obscures public value in our economy, leaving us ill equipped to fashion policy to drive national success in the 21st century.The first problem is that much of what G.D.P. measures as personal, private spending \u2014 which counts for two-thirds to 70 percent of the economy \u2014 is highly socialized consumption. It is not financed directly from households\u2019 private earnings, but from public sources or from publicly subsidized private sources.Government benefits through social insurance and the social safety net \u2014 about $2.3 trillion in 2012 \u2014 fund a large part of personal consumption. The same goes for nonprofit services and employer-provided benefits; these are counted directly as personal consumption. This is a huge oversight: In a 2011 Bureau of Economic Analysis study, the share of consumption from these \u201cindirect\u201d \u2014 mainly public or social \u2014 sources was found to be 30 percent in 2009, having quadrupled over the last five decades.Returns on public investment are another form of unmeasured public value. Take infrastructure. Using a very conservative model, the economists Robert J. Shapiro and Kevin A. Hassett estimate annual private gains of roughly $800 billion from our surface transportation infrastructure, compared with annual costs of roughly $185 billion. These significant gains are captured \u201cdownstream\u201d in G.D.P., largely as personal consumption. But they should not count as such; they are public gains, not private.A third form of mismeasurement is the benefit of regulation, or what might be termed our regulatory saving. In its first 20 years, the Clean Air Act generated health savings and other benefits valued at $22 trillion, compared with $500 billion in compliance costs. Arguably, net regulatory gains on such a scale should be considered a form of national saving, but they\u2019re not. Indeed, across many areas of regulation, we have a saving rate that matches and at times dwarfs the national saving rate as it is usually measured.Finally, there is the ever expanding realm of nonmarket capital, including human, social, intellectual and natural capital. Nonmarket capitalization, which significantly depends on government activities like education spending, public safety, research investments and environmental protection, is much larger than market capitalization as measured in private investment; it is also more significant for long-term prosperity. Yet it is ignored in our national accounts, jeopardizing our future prosperity.Human capital is the most closely linked to government activities, as it is mainly an output of public educational investments, combined with student and parental investments. The public money we spend on teachers\u2019 salaries helps produce high school graduates, many of whom become college graduates (indeed, mostly public-college graduates); these graduates, in turn, have been our country\u2019s most important asset for growth since the mid-20th century.In one leading model, gains from educational investment added $3.7 trillion to our national wealth in 2009, more than four times the value of public education as measured in G.D.P. that year. The return on educational investment is clearly enormous, yet it is nowhere to be found in the G.D.P. story of growth.In obscuring the value of government, the G.D.P. story is leaving us in the dark about potentially crippling trade-offs between fiscal and regulatory austerity and our needs as a society. If we ignore public value in our economy, we will be unable to craft effective policies for a better economic future. If we ignore the economic contribution of regulation, we are less likely to want more of it, exposing our children to greater social risks and costs.To develop a sustainable growth path, we should heed the business adage: You get what you measure. Fixing the measurement problems surrounding government activities is a good place to start.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feud Between Oligarchs Seen as Cause of Bank Run in Bulgaria", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Even in an Eastern European country with a history of financial panics and political intrigue, it was an alarming picture.Thousands of fearful depositors lined up outside one of Bulgaria\u2019s three largest banks. In a matter of hours on Friday, they withdrew the equivalent of nearly $550 million.The lines had dwindled by Monday after European and Bulgarian authorities took emergency measures. But questions remained about how a country could be plunged into crisis by what the authorities described as nothing more than a digital rumormongering campaign that may have been linked to animosity among rival business tycoons with political ties.The banking crisis coincides with acute political instability in Bulgaria, a country of 7.3 million. The Socialist-led government of Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski is expected to resign soon, after an agreement among the country\u2019s main political parties to hold elections on Oct. 5.European authorities on Monday authorized Bulgaria to pump about $2.3 billion into the country\u2019s banking system and insisted that Bulgarian banks were sound. But the bank run \u2014 the second in two weeks \u2014 added to fears that the European Union\u2019s poorest country could pose a new risk in a region already rattled by the crisis in Ukraine.So far the turmoil does not seem to have affected foreign-owned banks, which account for 70 percent of the market. The big ones include UniCredit of Italy and Raiffeisen Bank International, based in Vienna. But analysts warned that the crisis could still spiral out of control.\u201cWhile Bulgaria\u2019s dominant banks are foreign-owned \u2014 and therefore less exposed to domestic political infighting \u2014 further bank runs cannot be ruled out if the crisis is mismanaged or miscommunicated by the government,\u201d Otilia Dhand, vice president at Teneo Intelligence, a political consulting firm, wrote in a note to investors on Monday. \u201cThe Bulgarian population is prone to panic withdrawals due to memories of the disastrous banking crash of 1996.\u201dDuring that financial crisis, caused by government mismanagement of the economy, more than a dozen Bulgarian banks went bankrupt.On Sunday, Bulgaria\u2019s national security agency said it had detained six people suspected of using text messages, emails and social media to urge people to pull their money out of First Investment Bank, or F.I.B., the country\u2019s third-largest financial institution. One of those arrested was a manager at a brokerage firm in Sofia, according to local media reports.A similar attack on another bank, Corporate Commercial Bank, known by its Bulgarian initials K.T.B., appeared to be linked to convoluted maneuvering and two prominent businessmen with ties to different political parties. The Bulgarian central bank assumed control over K.T.B. on June 20 after more than 20 percent of its deposits were withdrawn in a week. The bank has since been temporarily closed.The problems appeared to be related to a public feud between the businessmen \u2014 Tsvetan Vassilev, the bank\u2019s largest shareholder, and Delyan Peevski, owner of a media empire and a member of Parliament. Mr. Peevski has accused Mr. Vassilev of making threats against him, and Mr. Vassilev has made similar accusations against Mr. Peevski.By some accounts, the crisis at K.T.B., which is controlled by Mr. Vassilev, began when Mr. Peevski withdrew large amounts of money. According to this version of the story, allies of Mr. Vassilev retaliated by spreading rumors about F.I.B., where Mr. Peevski was believed to have deposited the money he had taken out of K.T.B. Both banks were vulnerable because they had attracted deposits by paying unusually high interest rates.\u201cIt\u2019s really the war between the two oligarchs that has created a problem with those banks,\u201d said Tsveta Petrova, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political-risk consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem with the banking system.\u201dBut, she added, the panic could still spread to other banks. \u201cYou have to remember that in the mid-1990s, Bulgaria suffered a serious banking crisis,\u201d Ms. Petrova said. \u201cThat made people afraid of banking problems.\u201dThe financial tumult may also be related to the country\u2019s political turmoil.During barely a year in power, Mr. Oresharski\u2019s government was plagued by street protests against rampant corruption and a lack of transparency. In addition, Bulgaria has been caught in the crossfire between Russia, Europe and the United States because it is on a major transit route for gas from Russia and other producers like Azerbaijan.Citing the political turmoil, Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded Bulgaria\u2019s sovereign credit rating to one notch above junk status in June, before the bank runs began.Some analysts point out that the Bulgarian economy is fundamentally sound, with government debt equal to only 19 percent of gross domestic product, one of the lowest debt ratios in the European Union. Bulgaria uses its own currency, the lev, which is pegged to the euro.Despite the political instability and the banking woes, last Thursday Bulgaria managed to sell more than $2 billion worth of 10-year government bonds paying annual interest of 2.95 percent, a record low for Bulgaria. Demand for the debt issue was double the amount for sale.Shares of F.I.B. rose almost 25 percent on Monday after assurances from European and Bulgarian leaders. In a statement, the European Commission said, \u201cThe Bulgarian banking system is well capitalized and has high levels of liquidity compared to its peers in other member states.\u201dRosen Plevneliev, the president of Bulgaria, said the government would not let the banks fail. \u201cBulgaria\u2019s bank system is stable, well regulated and capitalized, and there are no reasons for panic,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cThe international markets trust us. We should trust ourselves too.\u201dAt an F.I.B. branch in Sofia on Monday, where lines were shorter than on Friday, Dimitrina Grozeva, 50, said she was there not to withdraw money but rather to make a payment.\u201cI was a little scared,\u201d Ms. Grozeva said. But, she added, \u201cI think the attack was related to the unstable political situation in Bulgaria, and some people want to take advantage of it.\u201dMilen Enchev contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Carolina\u2019s Misunderstood Cut in Jobless Benefits", "Date": "2014-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomics Across StatesSince North Carolina effectively eliminated unemployment benefits last year for people unemployed 20 weeks or more, the state has become a symbol in the partisan wars over economic policy. People on either side of those wars have argued that it proves the economic advantages \u2014 or damage \u2014 of providing the long-term jobless with cash payments.But digging into the data suggests North Carolina should really be a case study in people seeing what they want to see. Over the last year, the state\u2019s economy has performed remarkably like the economy in nearby states.North Carolina is more than a case study, too. It is a laboratory for the rest of the country, given that at the start of this year, the federal government eliminated all benefits for the long-term unemployed. Both political sides have looked to North Carolina for evidence to bolster the positions they have taken in this debate.Republicans, who voted against extending unemployment benefits, argue that ending benefits will spur the long-term jobless to look harder for work; with more eager workers, employment will rise, conservatives say. Democrats, many of whom voted to continue jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed, say that ending benefits will force the unemployed to cut their spending, which may have broader ripple effects that could slow the labor market recovery.My reading of the North Carolina experiment is that it provides little support for either side.The question of whether to provide those benefits is an important one. But perhaps the answers should depend more on social values than on macroeconomic implications. After all, the point of unemployment insurance isn\u2019t to boost the economy as a whole, but rather to ensure that an unlucky few don\u2019t shoulder an unbearable burden. Whether we\u2019re doing that is a question more of values than of economic statistics.Let\u2019s dig into the details on North Carolina. The policy shift was particularly striking because most of the cost of providing benefits to the long-term unemployed had been paid for by the federal government. Effectively North Carolina refused to allow the federal government to put money into the pockets of those who had been without work for a long time. The stated goal was giving the unemployed more incentive to find new work.To shed light on that issue, we need a comparison group: an otherwise similar state that made no such change. The most obvious possibility is South Carolina, a neighbor that has a broadly similar industry mix. Over the same period, nonfarm payrolls in South Carolina grew by 1.6 percent. These numbers are based on a survey of employers, which has some statistical noise to it. But an alternative and more reliable data set \u2014 known to aficionados as the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which includes a head count from nearly every employer \u2014 shows a similar pattern. Employment grew by 1.3 percent in North Carolina and 1.5 percent in South Carolina, according to this census.The unemployment rate also fell quite sharply in both states, although slightly more in North Carolina. Statistical quirks in how unemployment is measured at the state level make these comparisons less informative. Indeed, the Labor Department itself advises that its unemployment survey \u201cprovides reliable estimates of national aggregates,\u201d but \u201cits sample is spread too thinly geographically to provide acceptable reliability at the state and sub-state level.\u201dAmong other neighboring states, Georgia and Tennessee also experienced slightly faster job growth than North Carolina (although this ranking is reversed in the less reliable nonfarm payroll series). Virginia, which was hit by the government shutdown, barely grew.The bottom line is that North Carolina looks quite similar to its peers, and certainly not better.Moreover, there are enough noisy indicators that pundits have been able to cherry-pick specific numbers to support stronger claims, even though they are at odds with the broader trends seen in the most reliable of these statistics.Half a year after North Carolina\u2019s change, it took on added importance, because the federal government took a similar step. In particular, at the start of 2014, Congress declined to renew the federal program that funded extended unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed. In most states, this was a huge shift, spelling the end to benefits for the long-term jobless.Some conservatives have argued that the subsequent improvement in the labor market this year is proof that ending extended benefits was a wise policy; the acceleration of job growth, in their view, was caused partly by the benefits cut. However, this conclusion follows only if the economy improved by more than it would have if there were no policy change. Once again, what is needed is a comparison group: a state that didn\u2019t cut benefits at the start of this year.This is where North Carolina becomes important again. The cut in federal funding had no effect in North Carolina, because it wasn\u2019t accepting that funding. This makes it the ideal \u201ccontrol group.\u201d By contrast, in neighboring South Carolina, the policy shift caused the duration of unemployment benefits to be cut to 20 weeks. If cutting benefits boosts the labor market, the policy change should have led South Carolina to outperform North Carolina in 2014.Yet over the six months since federal benefits ended, nonfarm payrolls grew by 0.6 percent in South Carolina and 0.4 percent in North Carolina. Again, the trends in the two states remain strikingly similar. There\u2019s simply no evidence in either case study that cutting benefits cuts unemployment.How, then, have advocates come to different conclusions? They have relied on evidence that isn\u2019t really evidence, often to support conclusions that fit their pre-existing views. It can make for claims that sound persuasive on the surface but do not stand up to scrutiny.The 50 states in this country are often called laboratories of democracy. They can also be laboratories of economics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbus Confirms It Will Upgrade A330", "Date": "2014-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFARNBOROUGH, England \u2014 The Airbus Group on Monday announced a plan to build an upgraded, more fuel-efficient version of its best-selling wide-body jet, the A330, in a bid to maintain competitiveness against its American rival, Boeing, in the market for long-range passenger planes.Expected to enter service in late 2017, the new plane, called the A330neo \u2014 for \u201cnew engine option\u201d \u2014 will be fitted with larger engines built by Rolls-Royce of Britain, which can fly longer distances and burn 10 percent less fuel than the current model.Airbus said the new engines, a larger wingspan and other improvements to the plane\u2019s aerodynamics, as well as the addition of 10 extra seats, would achieve total fuel cost savings of around 14 percent per flight. The existing version of the A330 seats 250 to 300 in a standard, two-class configuration.\u201cWe are again leveraging a proven aircraft with a wide operator base, and making it even more efficient with the latest innovations and technology developments,\u201d Fabrice Br\u00e9gier, the head of Airbus\u2019s commercial jet business, said in a statement.Airbus has sold nearly 1,100 A330s over the past 20 years and has orders for around 250 more. Analysts estimate that the plane contributes around 40 percent of Airbus\u2019s commercial aircraft profits. But with the advent of a new generation of lightweight, carbon-fiber wide-bodies like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus\u2019s own A350-XWB, due out this year, the A330 is starting to show its age.Even with its new engines and other improvements, analysts said the fuel economy of the A330neo would still fall about 15 percent short of those newer planes \u2014 obliging the European plane maker to offer the plane at a significant discount.Analysts said that extending the life of the A330 would help maintain a valuable source of cash for Airbus at a time when less mature aircraft in its stable \u2014 like the twin-deck A380, or the A350 \u2014 were still years away from recouping their development costs. Without an upgrade, Airbus\u2019s backlog of orders for the current A330 model would have dried up by 2016 at current production rates of 10 planes a month.\u201cThis is Airbus\u2019s highest-margin product, so it was a necessary move,\u201d said Sash Tusa, an aerospace analyst at Edison Investment Research in London. \u201cIt is imperative for Airbus to keep A330 production rates as stable as possible.\u201dAirbus says it can attract as many as 1,000 new customers for an upgraded A330, enough to keep its assembly line in Toulouse, France, humming for another decade.A number of top customers \u2014 including Delta Air Lines and the Malaysian-based low-cost carrier AirAsia X, as well as major jet-leasing companies like the Los Angeles-based Air Lease Corporation \u2014 have expressed keen interest in an upgraded A330, particularly if the planes can be delivered sooner than rival models.A flood of orders for newer wide-bodies has stretched the backlogs for the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350, which means that airlines that order those planes today must face wait times of up to six years. By promising delivery of the A330neo in less than four years, Airbus is hoping to attract more impatient customers.Hours after disclosing its plans, Airbus announced that Air Lease Corporation had signed an initial agreement to buy 25 of the 310-seat version of the plane, which Airbus will market as the A330neo-900. John Leahy, Airbus\u2019s chief salesman, said that at the new list price of $275 million, the commitment is valued at $6.9 billion.The price is in line with the prices of Boeing\u2019s similarly sized 787s, which list for $250 million to $290 million, and it compares with around $295 million for Airbus\u2019s lightweight A350, which seats 300 to 350 people.A smaller, 250-seat version of the A330neo, the A330neo-800, will cost just over $241 million, Airbus said.With the introduction of the new A330, Airbus said it had decided to stop offering a 270-seat version of its A350, the smallest offering in that series, which had failed to generate significant interest from airlines.\u201cWe have listened to the market,\u201d Mr. Br\u00e9gier said.Mr. Br\u00e9gier said the majority of the early airline customers for the smaller A350 had already opted to swap those orders for larger versions. He said Airbus expected that its remaining backlog for the plane, the A350-800, would also eventually be converted to orders for the A330neo or the 314-seat A350-900.Rolls-Royce said on Monday that the engine it would develop for the A330neo, called the Trent 7000, would be capable of generating up to 72,000 pounds of thrust and provide an additional 400 nautical miles of range. The engines, equipped with larger fans to reduce fuel consumption and noise, would incorporate many of the same technologies used on the engines Rolls-Royce produces for the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350.Airbus said it expected to spend up to $2 billion to upgrade the A330, an investment that it said would pare the company\u2019s return on sales by less than 1 percent a year between 2015 and 2017.News of plans to upgrade the A330 dominated the first day of the weeklong Farnborough International Airshow, which was expected to see a more subdued pace of jet purchases from airlines after several years of major orders, particularly from fast-growing carriers in Asia and the Persian Gulf.Despite an improving global economy and a stronger earnings outlook \u2014 the International Air Transport Association predicts global combined profits of $18 billion this year, up from less than $11 billion last year \u2014 analysts said the slowdown in ordering was inevitable because airlines needed time to integrate their new planes into their fleets. Fewer orders would also give manufacturers and their suppliers time to reduce order backlogs.Other aircraft deals announced Monday included a $3 billion preliminary order for 30 of Boeing\u2019s upgraded 737 single-aisle jets from Monarch Airlines, a British charter carrier and longtime Airbus customer. Avolon, an Irish leasing company, agreed to purchase six Boeing 787 Dreamliners as well as five upgraded 737s. That order would be worth $2 billion at current list prices.Boeing also won a firm order for 10 737s from Okay Airways, a privately owned regional airline based in Beijing, worth roughly $1 billion.In addition to placing the first order for the Airbus A330neo, Air Lease Corporation agreed to buy 60 of Airbus\u2019s 185-seat A321 single-aisle jets, known as the A321neo, valued at more than $4 billion.International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways and Iberia of Spain, and AerCap, a Dutch leasing company, firmed up previously announced plans to buy a total of 70 150-seat A320neo jets, in a deal valued at more than $7 billion at list prices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Less Boyish at the Bolshoi", "Date": "2014-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBallet fans love a campy, insidery way of referring to dancers by their first names, regardless of whether they\u2019ve ever met them or would presume thus to address them. Margot, Rudi, Natasha, Lynn, Anthony, Suzanne, Misha, Gelsey were among the darlings of my youth, and today, it\u2019s Wendy, Marcelo, Alina, Herman, Gillian, Sara, Robbie. Most of these are not remotely household names around the world, in the way that Oprah and Brad are. But that\u2019s the point. They\u2019re names in the cliquey household of ballet. To employ first names shows you belong. By the time he joined the Bolshoi in 2011, Mr. Hallberg was already the world\u2019s foremost paragon of classical style. So perhaps the largest question is: Are his Moscow endeavors reducing rather than enhancing his perfection? His only role in the Bolshoi\u2019s Lincoln Center season, ending on Sunday, has been as Prince Siegfried in \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d with choreography by Yuri Grigorovich. Mr. Hallberg did much in this ballet to show what his Bolshoi experience has taught him. His dancing is bigger and broader. And the special new gain is a yet greater flow of thick-cream cantilena phrasing: Each dance comes as a single thought, a firm legato flow containing numerous dynamic gradations. And yet the Bolshoi Hallberg is \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 not the best of Hallberg.Mr. Hallberg\u2019s height (6 foot 1); strikingly elegant proportions (broad shoulders, slender waist, long limbs and neck); and the calm flow of his musculature are what have long been recognized as \u201cnoble.\u201d Such physical majesty fluently evokes the class distinctions of the European societies for whom ballet was developed, as do the courteous graciousness of his stage manners and the unforced distinction with which he carries his head. And in one particular respect \u2014 the dolphin arches of his feet \u2014 he\u2019s phenomenal.It\u2019s not just a matter of how he looks and stands. His virtues grow when he dances, thanks to the purity and singing lyricism of his line and the dazzling clarity of his execution. When he strikes an arabesque (extending one leg behind him), he addresses a space far beyond the proscenium arch, larger than the stage, and becomes a work of ideal geometry himself. Many dancers are gymnasts, but his glory is mixed with an element of restraint; he has composure within exultance. In many ways, he evokes the famous phrase with which Chaucer described one character in \u201cThe Canterbury Tales\u201d: a \u201cverray, parfit, gentil knyght\u201d: a \u201ctrue, complete, courteous knight.\u201dHe comes into his own when jumping; the air is his home domain. He not only soars, but he also cuts a radiantly proportionate shape, tipped by the arcs of those stretched feet. And in an art where it\u2019s often hard to distinguish between \u201cnoble\u201d and \u201cclassical,\u201d he quickly ascended to become the foremost classical stylist of our day. In 2010, Ballet Theater presented two of the world\u2019s greatest ballerinas, Alina Cojocaru and Natalia Osipova, as Aurora in \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty,\u201d on the same day; it was a luxury to see both. But for perfection of form, it was Mr. Hallberg, partnering Ms. Osipova, who set the most exemplary standards. At every point, he\u2019s shown himself an artist keen to grow beyond the royal-family and cavalier roles. Early parts included Death in Kurt Jooss\u2019s \u201cThe Green Table\u201d (I missed that); a nondancing character in Antony Tudor\u2019s \u201cPillar of Fire\u201d (he showed how well he understood how to act through the language of stance, eyes, gesture, all used with extreme restraint); and a sailor on leave in Jerome Robbins\u2019s \u201cFancy Free.\u201d He\u2019s created roles in ballets by Alexei Ratmansky (a whole series between 2009 and 2013), Twyla Tharp, Christopher Wheeldon and others.\u201cIt may also account for his unusual economy of movement,\u201d she continued, \u201cas well as his concentration, particularly evident during the company\u2019s morning class.\u201dBallet people have a bad habit of speaking as if classical meant 19th century. This is a particular mistake in the male roles of the old ballets, most of whose steps were rechoreographed in the 20th century. And Mr. Hallberg disproves it. He\u2019s applied himself with extreme distinction to the highest flights of classicism choreographed by George Balanchine and Frederick Ashton. The lead man of Balanchine\u2019s \u201cTheme and Variations\u201d (1947) does a dazzling string of alternating pirouettes and double air turns; here Mr. Hallberg makes an arresting contrast between the speed of the double air turn and the leisure of the single pirouette, all the while stringing them together in a single phrase, as one idea rather than a series of stunts. The male role of Balanchine\u2019s \u201cBallo della Regina\u201d (1977) has never been danced so well as when he took it on in 2007: lightness, speed and glowing luster.Like Mr. Hallberg today, the Royal Ballet\u2019s Anthony Dowell, in the late 1960s and 1970s, seemed the world\u2019s purest classical stylist; some of us no sooner hear the word \u201cline\u201d than our minds still fly to memories of his dancing. He was fortunate in that Ashton made him a long series of roles between 1964 and 1983; Mr. Hallberg \u2014 whose style often recalls Mr. Dowell\u2019s \u2014 has now danced three of the most distinctive of those parts, with Mr. Dowell coaching him. As a consequence, Mr. Hallberg is the world\u2019s leading Oberon in Ashton\u2019s one-act \u201cThe Dream\u201d: Everything about this fairy monarch \u2014 the elements of danger, magic, control, as well as dazzling fluency and partly androgyne grace \u2014 suits him thrillingly. (Too bad a short-term injury led him to cancel his appearances in Ballet Theater\u2019s recent revival.)I\u2019ve mentioned Ms. Osipova, that often electrifying powerhouse; at Ballet Theater, Mr. Hallberg partnered her in a number of works between 2009 and 2013. She\u2019s nothing like him in build or temperament. And for that very reason (opposites attract), theirs was a historic partnership in certain ballets, notably their first joint accounts of \u201cGiselle\u201d and Kenneth MacMillan\u2019s \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d Mr. Hallberg has said that their first \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d together (in 2010) was a breakthrough for him. (\u201cI stopped acting Romeo and just became Romeo.\u201d) In 2011, when Sergei Filin, the Bolshoi Ballet\u2019s artistic director, invited Mr. Hallberg to join the company, Ms. Osipova was certainly one reason that Mr. Hallberg accepted.The most famous Bolshoi men have been its super-hunks, its flying gymnasts (Vladimir Vasiliev, Irek Mukhamedov, Ivan Vasiliev), the most red-blooded men in world ballet. Mr. Hallberg\u2019s noble type seems at first far more akin to the greater refinement of the Mariinsky Ballet of St. Petersburg, but he knew what he wanted. \u201cThe Bolshoi style is bigger and more emotional, in a way that I love,\u201d he said at the time of joining. \u201cIt has the freshness and intensity that is like what I\u2019ve tried to achieve in my dance-acting roles.\u201d At the same time, Mr. Filin rightly observed in an interview that the Bolshoi has always had its noble exemplars, too; but the reason his proposal was attractive to Mr. Hallberg is that he offered an irresistible chance for artistic growth. We\u2019ll never know if Mr. Hallberg\u2019s career would have proceeded differently if the acid throwing had never occurred. There are strong signs that the Bolshoi is backpedaling furiously just now toward its old Soviet identity; Mr. Filin\u2019s contract may not be renewed.In \u201cGiselle,\u201d which Mr. Hallberg danced with the Bolshoi in Washington in May, there were faint signs that he was trying to sacrifice classical form for a new level of dramatic wildness, and here \u2014 as when he danced the same ballet this June with Ballet Theater \u2014 it was impossible not to feel anxiety. (I remember Mr. Dowell going through a similar stage; however, it proved transitional.)When I last saw the Grigorovich \u201cSwan Lake\u201d on screen, Siegfried was played by Ruslan Skvortsov \u2014 who has been a central figure in several of the Bolshoi\u2019s 2010-11 broadcasts. Though his dancing has less gleam than Mr. Hallberg\u2019s, his characterization has more depth. He \u2014 like Ballet Theater\u2019s Marcelo Gomes \u2014 has a manly force that enriches the tragedy. Likewise, Mr. Hallberg in Moscow could not give the title figure of \u201cMarco Spada\u201d the gravitas of a father with a grown daughter, whereas the younger Igor Tsvirko could. Can the Bolshoi teach Mr. Hallberg how to acquire more weight? Let\u2019s hope so. As he moves to full maturity, he should leave behind some of the sweet boyishness that was so touching in his earlier interpretations. (His prettily gracious tricks of eyes, mouth\u00a0and arms this year have reduced his authority in princely roles.)The biggest recent advances in Mr. Hallberg\u2019s exceptional career have not come from his Moscow work, but from the Moscow choreographer who moved west in 2009, Mr. Ratmansky. With him in New York, Mr. Hallberg has created an astonishingly varied panoply of roles: Olga\u2019s fianc\u00e9 in \u201cOn the Dnieper\u201d (2009), with his marvelous solo of perplexity; the 2010 \u201cNutcracker\u201d prince (who somehow contains his own happily amazed younger self); the glamorously abusive sorcerer Kaschei in \u201cThe Firebird\u201d (2012); the anguished, questing artist investigating art and life in \u201cChamber Symphony\u201d (2013). None of these have been flawless successes, but they have taken Mr. Hallberg and us to new terrain as the Moscow ballet company no longer can.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Targets South Korea Over Steel ", "Date": "2014-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Commerce Department declared Friday that South Korean steel companies and those in seven other countries were illegally dumping low-cost steel pipes and tubing into the American construction market and would be subject to additional duties.China has been the primary target of ire among steel manufacturers in the United States, having exported vast quantities of steel in the last decade. In 2010, the United States levied duties on the importation of Chinese steel tubes in a major victory for the American industry.But since that ruling, Korea and other countries have stepped into the vacuum left by a drop in Chinese imports. In 2013, South Korea exported 894,300 metric tons of steel tubes into the United States at a value of more than $800 million, according to data released by the Commerce Department. The seven other exporters named in Friday\u2019s decision exported about $630 million worth of steel in the same year.Under United States law, dumping occurs when a company sells its goods at less than their \u201cfair value,\u201d according to the Commerce Department. The cases announced Friday also involved companies that received financial assistance from their governments that benefited the production of their goods.The ruling said the action was intended to help American steel companies \u201cseek relief from the market-distorting effects caused by injurious dumping and unfair subsidization of imports into the United States, establishing an opportunity to compete on a level playing field.\u201dIf the trade commission affirms that the dumping alleged by the Commerce Department has harmed the industry, varying duties would be imposed on imports of the tubes from the eight exporters. The department said tubes from South Korea would receive tariffs of 9.89 percent to 15.75 percent.Officials at American steel companies and their industry representatives hailed the decision as an important step toward fair competition.Calling it \u201ca good day for America\u2019s steelworkers,\u201d Scott N. Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said, \u201cThe outpouring of bipartisan support from Congress and the thousands of workers who took the time to make their voices heard underscored the importance of this decision.\u201dMario Longhi, the chief executive of United States Steel, which was among the companies that initiated the complaint against their foreign rivals, said the decision would help his company and others compete for their fair share of the market for steel tubes.\u201cAs a result of rising imports, United States Steel has suffered mightily \u2014 orders have been reduced, mills have been idled and jobs have been lost,\u201d Mr. Longhi said in a statement. \u201cOur only recourse against such actions was with the U.S. Department of Commerce and their ability to support the rule of law and create a level playing field for American manufacturing.\u201dThe South Korean Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The action by the United States to impose duties on the steel imports is part of a larger international battle over the manufacture of steel, which is critical in most construction.And the decision on steel tubes from South Korea and the other exporters is a smaller-scale version of the efforts by American companies to combat what they claim is unfair competition by Chinese companies. American executives say the subsidization of manufacturing by the Chinese government, along with currency manipulation and other factors, gives the Chinese competitors an unfair advantage.The dumping allegations are a factor in the often tense relationship between the United States and China as the world\u2019s two largest economies vie for power and influence in Asia and around the globe. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Beijing this week as part of an effort called the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, aimed at improving relations between the two countries.In recent months, those relations have been strained by China\u2019s assertion of dominance in waters contested by the Japanese and Vietnamese, and by allegations that American government computers have been hacked by people with Chinese connections.The current case involving steel tubing was focused primarily on South Korea, which the American companies contended was dumping virtually all of its steel tubing on the American market. A preliminary decision in February by the Commerce Department found that Korean companies were not dumping.That ruling enraged officials in the American steel industry and their supporters on Capitol Hill, who argued strenuously in public over the last several months that Korean steel tubes should be subject to duties because they are being sold at below cost in the American market.The announcement by the Commerce Department on Friday reversed the earlier decision, a move that analysts said was not uncommon.In addition to South Korea, the Commerce Department said that companies in the following places are dumping steel tubes into the United States: India, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Helping China\u2019s Doves", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSINGAPORE \u2014 China is on the verge of destroying a geopolitical miracle. In 1980, its economy was less than one-tenth that of the United States. In 30 years, China rose to become No. 2 in the world, without disrupting the world order. Suddenly, with little warning, three decades of careful management of its external challenges have been replaced by three years of assertive and occasionally reckless actions.This new posture partly explains an emerging Western media consensus that China has become an expansionist military power, threatening its neighbors and the world. But before this consensus is set in stone, we should remind ourselves what a large, complex society China is: Neither the country nor its government is monolithic. On a recent visit to Beijing, I saw that a lively debate is taking place among senior leaders on the strategy China should adopt as it moves toward becoming the world\u2019s No. 1 economy.\u201cThe young officers are taking control of strategy, and it is like young officers in Japan in the 1930s,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are thinking what they can do, not what they should do. This is very dangerous.\u201dI agree. These Chinese hawks are dangerous. We can only speculate on what\u2019s driving this aggressiveness among the officer class. Like members of other military establishments, they may have a vested interest in tension, rather than calm.They argue that China\u2019s recent aggressive behavior has unleashed a \u201ctiger\u201d of anti-China sentiment that will be difficult to cage again. Most important, they say, time is on China\u2019s side. It can afford to be patient as its power grows.Given this internal debate, it would be unwise to rush to judgment. China will not necessarily become more hostile. Western prophecies of a dangerous China could even prove self-fulfilling if they provoke a nationalist backlash. The Chinese are still haunted by the humiliations endured at the hands of Western powers in the two 19th-century Opium Wars. The surge of anti-China opinion journalism is feeding the hawks\u2019 assertion that there is a \u201ccontainment conspiracy\u201d on the part of the West.When Mao Zedong and Deng ruled China, they paid scant attention to public opinion. Both leaders made significant territorial concessions when they settled China\u2019s border disputes with Russia and Vietnam. Deng even made a generous offer of a \u201cpackage plan\u201d in an attempt to settle the Chinese-Indian border dispute in 1980. Today, no Chinese leader, not even President Xi Jinping, can make unilateral concessions of that kind.Chinese public opinion matters in a way it never did before. China now has the largest Internet user community in the world; it is dynamic and vibrant \u2014 but also in danger of being dominated by the more virulent voices. Chinese leaders must be responsive to Chinese public opinion, but the West also has a role to play, in realizing how its actions can inflame rather than calm nationalist sentiment.The priorities of China\u2019s leaders have not changed. They spend perhaps 90 percent of their time focused on internal, not external, issues. To succeed in their reform efforts, Mr. Xi and Prime Minister Li Keqiang face considerable domestic challenges.They have begun a major campaign against corruption. While this effort is undoubtedly entangled with factional struggles within the party, corruption is the one force that could ruin the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. Success is far from guaranteed, with opponents devising ingenious ways of protecting themselves. Senior army figures, it has been suggested, may be stoking external tensions to save themselves from internal investigations.Above all, the economy looms large in the minds of Chinese leaders. The need to reduce the role of state-owned enterprises is one of the major challenges facing the nation. China now produces seven million university graduates a year, many of whom cannot find work. This is a far bigger issue for China\u2019s leaders than sovereignty over some barren rocks in nearby seas.Since the leadership wants to focus on domestic problems, the world should let it. The international community has a clear interest in the doves winning out over the hawks in the internal debate over China\u2019s geopolitical role, so it should ask itself one simple question: What can we do to help the doves?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Air France-KLM Lowers Its Earnings Forecast", "Date": "2014-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Air France-KLM warned Tuesday that weaker-than-expected demand during the peak summer travel season was likely to mute earnings growth this year as a rising number of unsold seats on crucial routes to North America and Asia has forced many large European carriers to lower their fares.The warning came despite Air France-KLM\u2019s aggressive effort to lower costs and step up its competitive game on lucrative long-haul services.The airline, Europe\u2019s third-largest by number of passengers, forecast an operating profit of no more than 2.3 billion euros, or about $3.1 billion, this year, less than an earlier target of around \u20ac2.5 billion.The airline said the effects of overcapacity in its passenger business were being compounded by persistently weak demand for airfreight amid a lukewarm recovery in the global economy.The warning sent shares of the French-Dutch group and other airline stocks lower on European exchanges. It came just weeks after a string of earnings downgrades from other European rivals, including Lufthansa of Germany, Aer Lingus of Ireland and Icelandair.The adjustments signaled continued headwinds for Europe\u2019s full-service carriers. They are scrambling, in the midst of steep European unemployment and high oil prices, to fight a two-front battle against budget airlines in their home markets, as well as encroachment on their lucrative long-distance routes by fast-growing rivals from the Persian Gulf.\u201cIt does seem as though some of the legacy European airlines have hit a bit of an air pocket in terms of overcapacity,\u201d Stephen Furlong, an airline analyst at Davy, a brokerage in Dublin. With the recovery still weak and larger economies like Germany now starting to stumble, \u201cdemand is fragile,\u201d Mr. Furlong said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to get into an oversupply situation.\u201dEuropean airlines increased their scheduled capacity for the summer period, which runs from April through October, by 1.4 percent this year compared with a year earlier, according to the Association of European Airlines in Brussels. That equates to around 10 million additional seats. The number of scheduled flights on trans-Atlantic routes is up 6 percent from last year, bolstered by additional flights to Brazil because of the World Cup soccer tournament there.Air France-KLM, after more than two years of painful cost-cutting and staff reductions, has been making steady progress toward a goal of paring debt and reducing costs by more than \u20ac2 billion with an eye to returning to profitability by the end of 2015. The airline reported a net loss in 2013, but recorded its first annual operating profit in three years.In a statement, the group stressed that its lowered earnings forecast still represented a 20 percent improvement over 2013 and said that it remained on track to reduce outstanding debt to \u20ac4.5 billion by 2015, from \u20ac5.3 billion at the end of last year.The effort, which involves the elimination of almost 8,000 jobs, comes as the airline is also investing \u20ac1 billion in the coming years to upgrade to its premium-class cabins to better compete with ever-more lavish amenities being offered on the trans-Atlantic services of competitors like Emirates of Dubai, Etihad of Abu Dhabi and Qatar Airways.The first of the new cabins, which include business-class berths that recline to flat beds, debuted on Air France\u2019s New York-to-Paris routes last month. The company has already installed upgraded business-class seats across its fleet of 22 Boeing 747s and will be upgrading its other wide-body jets beginning in September.Lufthansa, too, is trying to wrestle down its operating costs through staff reductions and transferring most of its domestic and short-haul European services to a low-cost subsidiary, Germanwings. The Frankfurt-based carrier was expected to announce additional restructuring measures on Wednesday, as well as capacity reductions for the winter season.Without a strong upturn in economic growth, analysts predicted that other full-service European carriers, as well as large, low-cost airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet, could be forced to reduce capacity in the coming months to stabilize airfares.Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend, a consultancy based in London, said that continued high operating costs were an important factor in limiting the ability of legacy carriers like Air France and Lufthansa to respond quickly to short-term fluctuations in demand for air travel.\u201cThe onus is on them to get a more appropriate cost model that gives them the flexibility to respond,\u201d Mr. Morris said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kerry Presses China to Abide by Maritime Laws to Ease Tensions", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In a closed-door session at a high-level gathering of Chinese and American officials here on Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry urged China to follow maritime law in nearby seas to reduce regional tensions, a senior American official said.Mr. Kerry called on China to support the creation of a legally binding code of conduct that other Asian nations are considering to enforce rules of navigation and inhibit unilateral actions in the South China and East China Seas, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under standard protocol.The secretary met with Yang Jiechi, a state councilor who deals with foreign policy, on the first day of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, an annual gathering of senior officials from both countries where differences on issues including national security, the economy, climate change and human rights are aired.Mr. Kerry also said efforts to create a \u201cnew status quo\u201d at the expense of regional harmony were \u201cunacceptable,\u201d the official said.Maneuvers by China to assert claims over islands and waters in the South China Sea, and to slow the efforts of a regional group, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to complete a code of conduct that would govern maritime rules have become a major point of friction between Washington and Beijing. The South China Sea is one of the world\u2019s busiest trading routes.President Xi Jinping opened the two-day event, saying a solid relationship between China and the United States was vital for everyone. \u201cCooperation between China and the U.S. will benefit the world, while the opposite will bring disaster,\u201d Mr. Xi said.China has recently increased its pursuit of territorial claims in nearby seas, leading to tense exchanges with neighboring countries. A map of some of the most notable disputes.He also stressed China\u2019s economic and military strength. \u201cThe vast Pacific Ocean has ample space to accommodate two great nations,\u201d he said, a comment suggesting that America\u2019s domination of the Asia-Pacific region over the last 60 years will not last.At his meeting with Mr. Yang, a diplomat known for his frank demeanor, Mr. Kerry set out Washington\u2019s objections to China\u2019s policies on several fronts and defended America\u2019s alliances in Asia, arrangements that have come under stiff criticism from Beijing, the official said.The secretary discussed China\u2019s deteriorating human rights record, citing specific cases of people imprisoned for many years, as well as those jailed in the last few months during a crackdown on lawyers and journalists, the official said. \u201cIn particular, he described our perception of the trend of an increase in arrests and harassment of individuals expressing political views,\u201d the official said.The suspension of the human rights discussion came despite meetings in recent years between Chinese and American officials led by the assistant secretary of state for human rights to discuss human rights and religious persecution in China.Mr. Kerry called for the human rights talks to resume, the official said. Similarly, he asked that China agree to continue formal talks on cybersecurity that China suspended in May after the indictment of five members of the People\u2019s Liberation Army by a United States grand jury on charges of cyberespionage.The American special envoy on climate change, Todd Stern, met with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission and a powerful figure in the Chinese bureaucracy. \u201cWe are making a great effort on our internal reasoning so we can make due contributions to climate change,\u201d Mr. Xie said.While there was no breakthrough agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, American officials said they detected more determination by the Chinese to curb pollution, which has become so bad that some Chinese leaders see it as a possible cause of political instability.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Carolina Budget Deal Includes a Raise for Teachers", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeaders of the Republican-controlled North Carolina legislature on Tuesday announced details of a tentative budget agreement, including a 7 percent pay raise for teachers in public schools, that could end a monthlong stalemate that has exposed a breach between Republican conservatives and moderates in the state.Legislative leaders announced some details of the $21.3 billion spending plan in an afternoon news conference in Raleigh, the capital. Most notably, they highlighted the $282 million earmarked for teacher salary increases. Phil Berger, the president pro tem of the Senate, said the money would raise North Carolina\u2019s average pay for public teachers to 32nd in the nation from 46th.But a number of analysts said Tuesday that they had a less-than-clear picture of where the state would get the $282 million. The answer is likely to be found in the text of the compromise bill, which was expected to be released on Wednesday. Low teacher pay has become an embarrassment in North Carolina, a state proud of its commitment to quality public education. But finding the money for the raises has been particularly vexing since last year, when Republican lawmakers, who hold full control of state government for the first time since Reconstruction, approved sweeping tax changes, including an income-tax cut that is expected to reduce state revenue by $680 million this year, according to an analysis by the state\u2019s Legislative Services Office.Representative Nelson Dollar, a Republican from Wake County, gave some hint on Tuesday of where the money would come from, saying lawmakers had found \u201ceconomies and efficiencies\u201d in the education system and reductions in the Medicaid system, including a 1 percent reduction in rates paid to providers.Previous Senate proposals recommended giving teachers a raise of up to 11 percent. But those were met with criticism from both House members and the state\u2019s Republican governor, Pat McCrory, because of their cuts, including the elimination of thousands of teaching assistant positions. The new plan would preserve teacher assistant positions, the news release said. Nonetheless, a number of observers were bracing for bad news.\u201cWe all know you can\u2019t give a 7 percent raise without doing a lot of bad things,\u201d said Adam Linker, a health policy analyst with the North Carolina Justice Center, a liberal group.Mr. McCrory has said in the past that he would veto any raise of more than 6 percent because of the cuts to jobs and services that he said would be necessary. Officials in the governor\u2019s office declined to comment on the new proposal Tuesday afternoon. His fellow Republicans hold veto-proof majorities in both chambers.The budget fight could have ramifications beyond the state: Mr. Tillis, the Republican nominee in the November general election for the United States Senate, is hoping to unseat Kay Hagan, a Democrat. To win the election, he may need the support of moderate North Carolina voters displeased with an ambitious package of conservative legislation enacted by lawmakers during the 2013 session.Alan Blinder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Week of Agony, From Eastern Ukraine to the Gaza Strip", "Date": "2014-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryThere are times when the endless crises and conflicts of our times reach such paroxysms of senseless tragedy that the world cries out for a halt.The strife in eastern Ukraine made little sense even before it brought down a civilian jetliner, taking the lives of 298 passengers and crew members with no connection whatsoever to the fight. The outcry was immediate, and the bulk of it was focused on Russia for its support \u2014 denied but obvious \u2014 for pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.According to American officials, the Malaysia Airlines jetliner, Flight 17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down by a missile fired from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, and the rebels had previously bragged about capturing a missile battery from the Ukrainian Army.The rebels and Russia denied responsibility. But for American and European leaders, the ultimate culprit was the vendetta Russia has waged against Ukraine by sanctioning the flow of men and arms to rebellious areas.In a tough statement on Friday, President Obama stopped just short of putting responsibility at the feet of President Vladimir V. Putin. It was not by chance, Mr. Obama said, that the insurgents were well armed: \u201cThat is happening because of Russian support.\u201dThe tumult over Ukraine coincided with an acute escalation of the 10-day duel between Hamas and Israel as Israeli tanks churned into Gaza to hunt down militants raining rockets on Israel. There was a dismal familiarity to the images of destruction and bloodshed, and the terrible sense that this was what Hamas had intended to provoke all along, and Israel was once again unable to avoid.But the downing of the Malaysian jetliner, after another Malaysian plane had gone missing, overshadowed the Middle Eastern drama.A day before the plane was shot down, the United States had sharpened sanctions against Russia, and Europe had followed suit with milder measures, both charging that despite conciliatory statements and gestures, Mr. Putin was continuing to fan the flames in eastern Ukraine. Russian markets promptly took a tumble.Mr. Putin\u2019s initial reaction was a predictable claim that the United States was entirely to blame for the \u201cfratricidal war\u201d in Ukraine, and that sanctions would primarily hurt Americans. That has been Mr. Putin\u2019s line ever since he orchestrated the annexation of Crimea in February \u2014 that Russia is the victim of an aggressive and unjust American foreign policy intended to \u201ccontain\u201d Russia, a deliberate echo of America\u2019s Cold War policy of \u201ccontainment.\u201d Yet while the annexation of Crimea and the pique over real or perceived humiliations could be understood, even if not justified, it has been harder to understand why Mr. Putin has persisted in supporting the rebels in eastern Ukraine for so long. He has shown no intention of annexing the eastern regions, yet he appears intent on keeping the flames burning with ever more casualties and dangers, and at ever higher costs to the Russian economy.One goal is clearly to ensure that Russia\u2019s allies gain control over the provinces adjacent to Russia. Another is to demonstrate to the West that Russia will resist any new attempt to infringe on what Russians perceive as their sphere of influence. There is also a political advantage to these actions: the tough assertion of Russian interests, and the claim that he is standing up to America, have given Mr. Putin a strong political boost at home, where his fortunes had been flagging.In any case, Mr. Putin has deemed it in his interest to sustain the crisis instead of seeking to consolidate whatever gains he expects at the negotiating table. Until now.The destruction of the Malaysian airliner abruptly changes the calculation. If it is confirmed that the jet was shot down by insurgents, Mr. Putin will be likely to find himself isolated globally and forced to cut the rebels loose. And if he fails to do so now, the possibility of a far more severe escalation of sanctions from an outraged Europe becomes much greater. As Mr. Obama put it, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for propaganda, we don\u2019t have time for games.\u201dIsrael Against Hamas In sharp contrast to the utterly unexpected twist in the Ukrainian story, the events in Israel and Gaza seemed to follow a well-practiced choreography: Palestinian provocations, powerful Israeli retaliation, fierce condemnation of Israel for the inevitably disproportionate casualties. As of Friday, the death toll in recent fighting stood at more than 270 Palestinians, many of them civilians, and two Israelis.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a veteran of many such clashes, seemed to anticipate the backlash in remarks to a special cabinet meeting on Friday, made public by his office. The army had no choice but to enter Gaza to close off tunnels the Hamas militants were using to sneak into Israel, he said.\u201cI know that in such campaigns, global public opinion always receives a distorted picture of the campaign,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cThis is unavoidable. But, unlike in the past, this time there are many in the international community who understand that it is Hamas \u2014 and Hamas alone \u2014 that is responsible for the victims. This is important for the state of Israel.\u201dFrom the White House, Mr. Obama said he had spoken by telephone to Mr. Netanyahu to reaffirm his \u201cstrong support for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself,\u201d but also to express concern \u201cabout the risks of further escalation and the loss of more innocent life.\u201dIn its first day, the Israeli offensive seemed to operate near the borders of Gaza, apparently targeting the Hamas tunnels. But Mr. Netanyahu said he had ordered the military to \u201cprepare for the possibility of significantly widening the ground operation.\u201dScore One for Berlusconi On a totally different front, the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was granted a surprise respite from his many legal entanglements when an appeals court overturned his conviction in a prostitution case.Mr. Berlusconi, a 77-year-old billionaire, had been charged with paying for sex with an underage prostitute and using his political influence on her behalf. The trial revealed sleazy accounts of \u201cbunga-bunga\u201d parties at Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s villa and other sordid details of his life. The conviction had carried a seven-year prison sentence and a lifetime ban on holding political office.The appeals court has yet to explain its decision. It was announced as Mr. Berlusconi was leaving a facility for patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, where he is serving community service in an unrelated tax fraud case. He is also on trial in Naples on charges of political corruption, and under investigation in Milan for witness tampering.Serge Schmemann is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times.

Internet companies bore the brunt of the selling.It was the second day of broad declines following record closes for major stock indexes last week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell below 17,000, a level it topped on Thursday for the first time. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index fell 1.4 percent, its biggest drop in two months.Among the biggest losers were Twitter and Pandora Media, a music streaming service, down 7 percent each. Facebook and Netflix each dropped more than 3 percent.Investors also unloaded small-company stocks, which tend to be riskier investments. The Russell 2000 fell 1.2 percent.The winners of the day were utilities, considered a safe choice in uncertain times and attractive because of their strong dividends. The utility sector rose 0.6 percent, the only one of the 10 in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index that finished higher.Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said the selling this week was not surprising given the S.&P. 500 has nearly tripled in price since the current bull market began in 2009, and also given that the rally has lasted more than five years, making it the fourth longest since World War II.\u201cThe longer it gets out of line with historical patterns,\u201d he said, \u201cthe closer we get to fizzling out.\u201dOn Tuesday, the Dow index fell 117.59 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 16,906.62.

Still, the relatively modest increase should help to feed slow but steady economic growth, because consumers rely on debt to pay tuition, buy cars and shop.Steven Ricchiuto, senior economist at Mizuho Securities, raised a note of caution, however, saying other signs of a slowing global economy have added to investor jitters. On Tuesday, Germany reported that exports fell more than expected in May and Britain said manufacturing output dropped 1.3 percent that month.The corporate earnings season began unofficially on Tuesday after the closing bell, when Alcoa reported results that were better than investors were expecting.

{"Headline": "Italian Leader Presses His Case for Budget Relief in Europe", "Date": "2014-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The presidency of the European Union is largely ceremonial, rotating every six months among the bloc\u2019s 28 nations. But Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy means to use its new presidency as a platform from which to seek relief for his country\u2019s debt-saddled economy.On Wednesday, the second day of his nation\u2019s six-month turn, Mr. Renzi, 39, said that the bloc\u2019s fiscal rules should put less emphasis on debt and deficit targets and do more to stimulate members\u2019 economies.\u201cWhat we\u2019re asking for now is to have growth as a fundamental element of European policy,\u201d Mr. Renzi said at the European Parliament, meeting in Strasbourg, France.Italy stirred some of the deepest fears at the low point of the European financial crisis as the cost of its national debt risked spiraling out of control. Unlike countries like Greece and Ireland, which received bailouts, Italy was considered too big to rescue.Yet Italy\u2019s economic prospects have arguably grown worse, and the main concern is a wearily familiar one: The country\u2019s towering public debt stands at about 130 percent of gross domestic product, the third largest such ratio in the developed world, after those of Japan and Greece.Italy\u2019s problems eased mainly because of a promise by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, to use its financial clout to protect countries like Italy and Spain from financial collapse. But so far, the central bank\u2019s main weapon of intervention in the debt markets \u2014 a proposed program of government bond-buying known as Outright Monetary Transactions \u2014 has not been put to an actual market test.For Italy, there is \u201ca very real danger that debt rises inexorably higher, forcing the country into some form of default,\u201d said James Howat, an economist with Capital Economics.As that debt mounts in Italy \u2014 Mr. Howat said it was likely to reach 135 percent of G.D.P. this year \u2014 the stability of the euro currency union, which is only just emerging from six years of nearly constant turmoil, could once again come into question.Because Mr. Renzi faces such severe fiscal limitations at home, he has sought external relief. He has already provoked a furious debate by proposing to ease some of the strictures of Europe\u2019s fiscal rule book, known as the Stability and Growth Pact.He gave no details of what he was seeking, but his remarks drew immediate fire from Manfred Weber, a German member of the European Parliament. \u201cWith a debt of 130 percent of G.D.P., where is the money supposed to come from?\u201d Mr. Weber asked Mr. Renzi, referring to Italy.Mr. Renzi has put himself on a collision course with Germany, a stickler for the bloc\u2019s fiscal rules.\u201cRome and Berlin are not on the same page when it comes to fiscal policy in the euro zone and have been at daggers drawn for quite some time,\u201d said Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, a consulting firm.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany \u201cwill face him down,\u201d Mr. Spiro predicted, referring to Mr. Renzi, but under pressure to further ease austerity, \u201cwill throw him a few bones.\u201dOne possibility, some economists say, might be to let Italy have more leeway in public spending that would not be counted against national budget limits.Despite the mainly ceremonial role, the European Union presidency does endow members of the Italian government with the authority to run European Union ministerial meetings. The first of those gatherings begins on Thursday when top officials of the bloc arrive in Rome for festivities to observe the start of Italy\u2019s turn at the helm.In another sign of expanding Italian influence, Roberto Gualtieri, a lawmaker from Mr. Renzi\u2019s party, is expected to be formally confirmed in coming days in the top post on the European Parliament\u2019s influential economic affairs committee.But perhaps the most significant advance for Mr. Renzi\u2019s European goals was the nomination last week of Jean-Claude Juncker to lead the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s top policy-making arm. Backed by the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Mr. Renzi made the introduction of greater budgetary flexibility a condition for supporting Mr. Juncker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Gains, Hamas Sees a Fight for Its Existence and Presses Ahead", "Date": "2014-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs added leverage for cease-fire negotiations, Hamas seems to have at least the dog tags and perhaps remains of one of the Israelis killed in combat. Internationally, there is both mounting outrage over the hundreds of civilian Palestinians dead and growing consensus that any cease-fire deal should include Hamas\u2019s demands for lifting trade and travel restrictions on Gaza and investing in its economy and infrastructure.\u201cAll these achievements of Hamas, if they strike a deal without achieving something for the people of Gaza, they will lose everything and will bury themselves,\u201d said Zakaria al-Qaq, a Palestinian political scientist at Al Quds University in East Jerusalem. \u201cIt\u2019s a very critical moment; Hamas is to be or not to be,\u201d he added. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t reach what they promised to reach, it will be like a balloon, just punctured.\u201d With large sections of Gaza devastated and the Palestinian death toll topping 1,000, Hamas waffled over the weekend on the United Nations\u2019 calls for a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d in hostilities. It said Saturday night that such a pause was unacceptable as long as Israeli troops maintained positions and limited operations inside Gaza, then hours later declared its own pause without conditions, a bewildering back-and-forth that made it difficult to glean a clear strategy.Politically isolated after breaks with Syria, Iran and especially Egypt, and its effort at reconciling with the Palestinian factions that rule the West Bank having failed to bear fruit, Hamas has all but given up on governing Gaza to focus on the battlefield. Israelis have expressed outrage that thousands of tons of concrete built a vast network of tunnels rather than schools or hospitals, but that argument has little traction in Gaza, where many see violence as the only language that works.Though weary of war, many Gazans see the so-called resistance as the only possible path to pressing Israel and Egypt to open border crossings, and to ending Israel\u2019s \u201csiege\u201d on imports and exports and naval \u201cblockade.\u201d Hamas and its backers in Qatar and Turkey have also been calling for a seaport and airport in the coastal enclave.\u201cThe only option left for us was to defend ourselves and to make Israel bleed the way that we have been bleeding all these years,\u201d said Ahmed Yousef, a former Hamas official who remains close to its leaders. \u201cIt is not acceptable to go back to a situation where we are being squeezed to death and where the whole society is being paralyzed.\u201dFaraj al-Loul, a plumber shopping for vegetables on Sunday in a Gaza City market, echoed the opinions of many residents interviewed who said life had become so miserable that they were willing to suffer the high costs of war if it could bring change. \u201cWe want a cease-fire, of course, but it has to be based on the demands of the resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they refuse to open the crossings, then we\u2019ll all become martyrs, God willing.\u201dPerhaps the biggest difference between this battle and the last round, in 2012, is Hamas\u2019s relationship with Egypt. Back then, President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, who sprang from the same Muslim Brotherhood that spawned Hamas, was a strong ally, and Egypt brokered the cease-fire that promised expanded fishing and farming zones in exchange for quiet. Now, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, who led the ouster of Mr. Morsi last summer, has branded Hamas an enemy along with the Brotherhood.Mousa Abu Marzook, a Cairo-based Hamas leader, posted a lengthy missive on Facebook criticizing Egypt for not enforcing the 2012 agreement and for siding with the enemy in the cease-fire proposal it put forward on July 14. Analysis of satellite imagery taken before and after the first two and a half weeks of the Israeli incursion.\u201cOur reading of the initiative is that its purpose is to embarrass Hamas,\u201d Mr. Abu Marzook wrote. \u201cThe current Egyptian initiative describes the actions of the resistance as hostile; we reject this description from our brothers in Egypt,\u201d he added. \u201cWe reject also that Egypt puts us on the same footing with the Zionist entity, or treats the victim and the executor by the same standard.\u201dPart of the confusion over Hamas\u2019s positions, several experts said, is caused by internal power struggles between its political and military wings, and among leaders inside and outside Gaza, a longstanding challenge worsened by Gaza\u2019s economic crisis and Hamas\u2019s loss of strategic allies. \u201cWhen Israel started attacking the Gaza Strip, Hamas saw an opportunity not only to stand up to Israel but to seek to resolve these broader issues,\u201d Mr. Rabbani said. \u201cThis conflict for them is a struggle to lift the blockade of Gaza more than anything else.\u201dSecretary of State John Kerry, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations and several European leaders have in recent days promised an easing of import, export and border restrictions as part of a cease-fire, coupled with security protections for Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel even spoke of the need for \u201ceconomic and social relief\u201d in Gaza on several American news shows on Sunday, but said it must be exchanged for a \u201cdemilitarization of Gaza.\u201dThat would mean the destruction of tunnels into Israel and of rocket stockpiles, with international guarantees that they would not be rebuilt or replenished, something Palestinian and Israeli analysts alike said Hamas would never abide.Jodi Rudoren reported from Jerusalem, and Ben Hubbard from Gaza.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Citro\u00ebn\u2019s Last American Gasp: French, Futuristic and Desired by Few", "Date": "2014-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAuto Ego14 PhotosOne Thursday last fall, Brian Brandt got a phone call from \u201cThe Americans,\u201d the FX Networks\u2019 period drama about Cold War-era Soviet spies living in a Washington suburb. An anxious member of the production staff explained that the show, filmed in a Brooklyn studio and at locations around Long Island, needed a car repaired \u2014 and back on the set the following Tuesday. Mr. Brandt was among the few people around New York City who could service this rarely seen model, a Citro\u00ebn DS. Distinctly French and with a shape said to resemble a flying saucer on wheels, the DS was last imported four decades ago. The owner of a record label for contemporary classic and jazz composers, Mr. Brandt, 57, only recently added Citro\u00ebn repair to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. But his loyalty to the brand traces back 40 years. At 17, he bought a well-used 1966 DS for $300. He still owns it.\u201cI guess that was kind of strange,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody else my age wanted muscle cars. But I had always admired Citro\u00ebns. I remember one on my grandmother\u2019s block in the Bronx.\u201dSeemingly decades ahead of its time at its 1955 debut, the DS brought radical aerodynamic design and a novel hydropneumatic suspension that yielded an uncannily smooth ride. Mr. Brandt, who lives in Manhattan with his wife, Alice Hom, used his DS as an everyday car for many years. At odds with the car\u2019s George Jetson styling, performance from the lowly 4-cylinder engine was strictly economy-class. That would not be the case with his next car.In 1993, Mr. Brandt bought a much sportier Citro\u00ebn luxury coupe from the 1970s, the SM. Car buffs call it the Citro\u00ebn Maserati, a nod to the source of its V6 power. The unlikely pairing of a French car with an Italian engine resulted from Citro\u00ebn\u2019s ownership of Maserati in 1968-75. Mr. Brandt\u2019s years of using the SM, including parking it on the street in Manhattan, took a toll on the body and mechanicals. The car today awaits restoration.In 2001, he bought a second SM, an impeccably maintained, original-condition 1973 model with just 40,000 miles. Garaged in Queens, it is Mr. Brandt\u2019s \u201cdistance car,\u201d now with over 100,000 miles. He adds about 6,000 more each year, with trips to Canada and to visit his son, Christopher, who attends the State University of New York, New Paltz.A drive to the Brooklyn auto repair shop where Mr. Brandt rents space for his Citro\u00ebn business started with a lesson in latching the two-piece lap and shoulder belts, a puzzle for first-time passengers. The design is not a French quirk, however; to meet federal regulations, Citro\u00ebn bought the belts from Ford, Mr. Brandt said. The Maserati V6 barked to life and settled into a lively growl at idle, sounds that might seem too energetic to those accustomed to the silken tones of modern luxury cars. A symphony of clicking and hissing, Mr. Brandt confirmed, came from the main hydraulic pump that pressurizes the car\u2019s suspension and steering systems.\u201cThe SM was designed at the same time as the Concorde,\u201d said Mr. Brandt, referencing the Anglo-French supersonic airliner. \u201cBoth were made to bring prestige for France.\u201dCitro\u00ebn brought about 2,000 1971-73 SMs into the United States. The car cost more than $13,000 in 1973, putting it at a level with Mercedes-Benz coupes. The SM\u2019s forte was relaxed high-speed cruising, not blazing acceleration. Its 3-liter 180-horsepower engine, shared with Maserati\u2019s Merak sports car, had to move a 3,300-pound car. Like all Citro\u00ebn cars since the 1930s, the SM used front-wheel drive. En route to the Williamsburg Bridge, Mr. Brandt pointed out the Citro\u00ebn\u2019s eclectic mix of high design and French opulence. In place of a conventional brake pedal, there is a large round floor button \u2014 owners call it the champignon, the French word for mushroom \u2014 that responds to foot pressure, and its single-spoke steering wheel sprouting from a dashboard filled with oval gauges surely must have looked futuristic in the early 1970s.Soft pleated brown leather upholstery and tasteful chrome accents create an ambience that falls between the relative starkness of a 1970s Mercedes and the lavishness of the period\u2019s Jaguars. The curved front bucket seats are as comfortable as they look, and the 41-year-old interior surfaces show little wear.At G&E Auto Repair in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, Mr. Brandt\u2019s business partner, Winsley Thomas, was repairing a DS model. Mr. Thomas began working on Citro\u00ebns 50 years ago in his native Guyana, and he was a technician at the company\u2019s United States headquarters in Englewood, N.J., from 1968 until operations ceased in 1977. The two met about 15 years ago, when Mr. Thomas was in Manhattan to repair a customer\u2019s SM, which coincidentally parked in the same garage that Mr. Brandt was using. \u201cHe\u2019s been working on my cars ever since,\u201d Mr. Brandt said.Citro\u00ebn specialists have all but disappeared from the area, and the remaining ones are widely scattered. A few years ago, Mr. Brandt decided to apprentice under Mr. Thomas, and the two now work on customer cars under the name Mode Motors. Local Citro\u00ebn loyalists have kept them busy, although it\u2019s not a route to riches.\u201cDoing the repairs brings in a little side money,\u201d Mr. Brandt said. \u201cI guess I have two impractical businesses. There\u2019s such a lack of return in the record industry, but I still enjoy setting up recording sessions in concert halls.\u201dMr. Brandt came to the recording industry by his love of music, not a career goal. A collection of recordings that began with progressive rock branched out to other genres, growing to some 8,000 albums. After running his own mail-order business for rare records, Mr. Brandt worked for PolyGram records, building a catalog of imports. When he was 25, he started his own label, Mode Records, to record new music by John Cage, the American composer perhaps best known for his silent 1952 composition, \u201c4\u201933\u201d.\u201d On the drive back to Manhattan, traffic came to a standstill at 62nd Street near the approach to the F.D.R. Drive. Mr. Brandt took it in stride.\u201cI don\u2019t mind getting caught in traffic, because I take the time to admire the car\u2019s details,\u201d he said, running his hand along the dashboard and window trim. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m surrounded by art.\u201dThe car, he explained, handles stop-and-go driving well.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get hot,\u201d he said, pointing to the temperature gauge, which remained in the normal range throughout a 45-minute slog. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a reliable car.\u201dHe qualified that claim with the caveat that an SM owner must do a few mechanical upgrades to make it so. The key ones \u2014 modifications to the engine\u2019s valves and timing chain \u2014 take an expert technician about two days to complete.On the F.D.R., now mercifully free of backups, the SM glides fluidly over the notoriously broken and wavy surface. The tires, however, announce each impact with a noticeable \u201cslap.\u201d Mr. Brandt has since replaced the Michelin radials, which are made only in small batches for older European cars and cost $450 each. Asked about the SM\u2019s reputation for acutely quick steering, Mr. Brandt confirmed that its sensitivity demands a gentle touch from the driver. But he lauds it as a safety measure.\u201cI\u2019ve avoided accidents by driving around problems that another car might not be able to,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you get acclimated to this car, nothing else you drive feels right.\u201d After crossing the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey, Mr. Brandt takes advantage of an open stretch on Interstate 80. The three-carburetor Maserati power plant sings at higher speeds, but even so, the answer to a query of which artists this music connoisseur plays on his car\u2019s \u201980s-vintage Blaupunkt stereo comes as a surprise.\u201cEven on long drives, I prefer to just listen to the engine,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Australia Tax Repeal Is Big Blow to Fight Against Emissions", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnalysts are viewing the move as a blow to plans for countries to knit together markets for trading emissions allowances.After a long political battle over the costs of the Australian plan, the repeal won final legislative approval on Thursday with the strong backing of the conservative government of Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The plan, which was built around a tax on carbon emissions and was one of the most ambitious and prominent of its type, was a contentious issue in Australian politics since it was enacted by the previous center-left government in 2012.Opposition politicians and environmentalists in Australia reacted with dismay, saying the move made Australia the first country to reverse progress on fighting climate change. It was also viewed with disappointment by proponents of establishing a global carbon-pricing system as the most effective way of reining in emissions. Australia is one of the world\u2019s largest sources of carbon emissions, and its policies have been watched closely by other nations as they struggle to agree on ways to control global warming.Australia\u2019s system was of particular interest to other countries because it was to have been linked with a similar trading program in Europe.Beginning next year, Australian businesses were to be able to buy European emissions allowances to use under the Australian program. A full two-way link between the two systems was to be in force by July 2018.This arrangement would have connected Europe\u2019s program, the world\u2019s largest, to what looked likely to be the third-largest. The deal might have served as a pilot for linking other systems emerging around the world, including those in China and California.\u201cIt is quite a setback to the global discussion of linking schemes and moving toward a global carbon market,\u201d said Marcus Ferdinand, an analyst at Point Carbon, a research firm based in Oslo.The Australian vote also further complicates long-running efforts by the United Nations to forge a global climate change treaty in 2015, aimed at committing the world\u2019s largest economies to making deep cuts in their carbon pollution.This fall, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, government leaders are expected to lay out their proposed domestic commitments for that deal. Australia\u2019s vote to gut its signature climate policy is likely to come under severe criticism at the meeting.In Europe, officials expressed disappointment at Australia\u2019s action.\u201cThe European Union regrets the repeal of Australia\u2019s carbon-pricing mechanism just as new carbon-pricing initiatives are emerging all around the world,\u201d said the European climate action commissioner, Connie Hedegaard. \u201cThe E.U. is convinced that pricing carbon is not only the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions but also the tool to make the economic paradigm shift the world needs.\u201dThe tax was devised to penalize hundreds of Australia\u2019s biggest emitters of carbon, setting a price of 23 Australian dollars, or $21.50, per metric ton of carbon dioxide when it was put into effect in 2012, when Julia Gillard of the Labor Party was the prime minister. The price rose to 25 Australian dollars per metric ton this month.Australia\u2019s Senate voted 39 to 32 on Thursday to approve the repeal of the measure. The House of Representatives voted earlier in the week to repeal it.Mr. Abbott, of the Liberal Party, who took office in September, made repealing the tax a central pledge of his election campaign, arguing that ending it would reduce electricity prices and enhance economic growth. But he struggled twice to get the measure through the Senate before the vote on Thursday.The government now plans to introduce a range of measures that it says will encourage business to reduce pollution, rather than penalizing polluters.After the vote on Thursday, Mr. Abbott characterized the tax as a \u201cuseless, destructive tax, which damaged jobs, which hurt families\u2019 cost of living and which didn\u2019t actually help the environment.\u201d He called it a \u201c9 percent impost on power prices, a $9 billion handbrake on our economy.\u201d .The Australian vote resonated in the United States, where environmental advocates have tried and failed for years to enact legislation that would put a price tag on carbon pollution. Opponents of carbon pricing, led by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, have sought to make the issue politically toxic, and groups financed by the brothers\u2019 company, Koch Industries, have run aggressive campaigns against lawmakers who support climate change policy.\u201cWe are drinking Foster\u2019s and putting shrimp on the barbie,\u201d said a celebratory Thomas J. Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, an advocacy group that receives financing from Koch Industries. It is running television ads ahead of the November midterm elections to try to unseat lawmakers who have supported carbon pricing.Mr. Pyle predicted that other nations with carbon-pricing policies would follow Australia. \u201cEurope is going to be the next one to do wholesale reversals of these policies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like salmon heading upstream.\u201dSenator David Vitter of Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, who is an opponent of President Obama\u2019s climate change policies, said in a statement: \u201cWhat Prime Minister Abbott has done is show true leadership.\u201d he addedd, \u201cAustralia\u2019s carbon tax was certain to provide all pain and no gain for Australia\u2019s economy.\u201dIn the absence of political support to enact a carbon-pricing law, President Obama has instead proposed a federal regulation that would force states to cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. Mr. Vitter said Australia\u2019s vote would give strength to Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal those regulations.Advocates of a stricter climate policy in the United States said that they were deeply disheartened by Australia\u2019s vote but that they drew lessons from it in their efforts to push through a future price on carbon.\u201cThis is a tremendous setback,\u201d said Steve Valk, communications director for the Citizens Climate Lobby, an advocacy group devoted to enacting a carbon tax in the United States. \u201cThe signal it sends to us is that they should have given the money back. If they had structured it so all the revenue was returned to households, the political will would have made it impossible to repeal it.\u201dAustralia is among the world\u2019s biggest producers of carbon emissions per capita. The government is committed to reducing emissions by 2020 to 95 percent of the levels recorded in 2000.Politicians from Labor and the smaller Greens Party said the repeal would undermine Australia\u2019s efforts to address climate change.The current Labor leader, Bill Shorten, described Mr. Abbott as an \u201cenvironmental vandal\u201d and said, \u201cToday, Tony Abbott has made Australia the first country in the world to reverse action on climate change.\u201dChristine Milne, a senator from Tasmania who is the leader of the Greens, said, \u201cHistory will judge Tony Abbott harshly for his denial of global warming and his undermining of Australia\u2019s effort to address it.\u201dJohn Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, an advocacy group based in Sydney, said that some governments had pulled back from carbon reduction targets, including Japan after the Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster in 2011, but that \u201cno one else in the world has repealed a working, functioning carbon-pricing mechanism.\u201d\u201cWe are taking a monumentally reckless backward leap even as other countries are stepping up to climate action,\u201d Mr. Connor said in an interview. He said that Australia was the highest per capita emitter of carbon in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of developed countries, and that it ranked in the top 20 globally, emitting around 25 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person every year.\u201cAustralia\u2019s economy is much more carbon-intensive than the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Connor said.Mr. Abbott had said that repeal would lead to lower energy costs for consumers. But Mr. Connor said that while Australian electricity prices had risen, that resulted partly from power companies\u2019 investments in infrastructure. \u201cThe government effectively used the carbon tax as the scapegoat for higher energy costs,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Janet Yellen Be Giving Us Stock Picks?", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPopping Bubbles\u201cHow do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions,\u201d Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, mused in 1996, and the next morning the stock market sold off ferociously on the mere hint of his concern.How things change.Ms. Yellen specifically called out the valuations of leveraged loans (which fund corporate buyouts) and high-yield \u201cjunk\u201d bonds (which fund companies viewed as having risky finances) as potentially excessive. She acknowledged that prices for a wide range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate, had risen, but argued that they \u201cremain generally in line with historic norms.\u201dA written report accompanying Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony went further still, specifically pointing to \u201csubstantially stretched\u201d valuations of social media and biotechnology stocks. An index of social media stock prices fell.These events raise an interesting set of questions: Should government officials be speaking up when they think markets have gotten prices wrong? At what point does the Fed chair go from being the nation\u2019s economist-in-chief to the market strategist-in-chief? And are Ms. Yellen\u2019s views something that investors should be listening to?Mr. Lew said: \u201cJim, I think it is appropriate for us to comment on policies and trends. It is not appropriate for us to comment on individual market movements.\u201dGiven the timing, and the way Mr. Cramer framed his question, it\u2019s hard not to read that as a rebuke of the Fed\u2019s approach to making its views on key asset prices known to the public.Here\u2019s the predicament that Ms. Yellen and other top policy makers face. The last two U.S. recessions have been caused by the popping of asset bubbles (first the stock market in 2000, then housing in 2007).Meanwhile, the mission they are assigned by Congress is to look after the real economy \u2014 maximum employment and stable prices, to be precise. But all of their policy tools work through the financial system. They are trying to maintain low unemployment and low inflation, but they do that almost exclusively by buying and selling bonds.That means that their policies often have a more significant impact (and certainly a more immediate and measurable one) on the price of, say, junk bonds than they do on job creation and wages.That basic issue is always true, but it has never been more true than lately, with the Fed deeply entwined with unconventional steps to try to boost economic growth, leading to nearly $4.5 trillion in assets ending up on the central bank\u2019s balance sheet.To some degree, the whole point of that exercise was to drive up the prices of stocks and other assets in order to encourage economic growth. But a key risk all along has been that the efforts would create a rise in asset values to bubble territory without accompanying economic growth.But if you believe that the Fed needs to keep doing everything it possibly can to get stronger growth, then you are left with a few other options. One, which Ms. Yellen has repeatedly emphasized, is regulating banks and other financial institutions well to ensure that even if a bubble does emerge, and pop, the rest of the economy doesn\u2019t go down with it. There is no reason that somebody paying too much for junk bonds or social media stocks now needs to cause a recession in 2016, in other words.And another is to use \u201copen mouth policy\u201d (as opposed to the usual \u201copen market policy\u201d), jawboning markets to try to rein in excesses that might create risks. It\u2019s not an outlandish idea. An economist, Dean Baker, has argued that if Mr. Greenspan had made full-throated, public arguments that there was a housing bubble in 2004 and 2005, it might have led to fewer people stretching to buy a home and less damage when the bubble eventually popped.But it does amount to a government official substituting her own judgment for that of the marketplace, the prices arrived at by thousands of buyers and sellers for an app-maker or a leveraged loan.For a sense of the risks there, consider this: Mr. Greenspan\u2019s warning about irrational exuberance in the stock market took place in December 1996. The worst excesses of the dot-com bubble came years later; even in the worst of the post-dot-com stock crash and the financial crisis of 2008, prices never again fell that low. A person who ignored Mr. Greenspan\u2019s advice and bought into the S&P 500 the morning after his speech has earned a 268 percent return since then (including reinvested dividends).As Ms. Yellen may learn, the challenge of telling people when the prices are right is that you might just be wrong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Contracts to Buy U.S. Homes Slipped in June", "Date": "2014-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in June, as the real estate market appears to have cooled off this summer.The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index slipped 1.1 percent to 102.7 last month. The index remains 7.3 percent below its level a year ago.Sales have been slowed by a mix of meager wage growth, rising home prices and mortgage rates that rose steadily through the end of last year.Pending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.Signed contracts in June fell in the Northeast and South. They rose slightly in the Midwest and West. Pending sales in all four United States regions are below last year\u2019s pace.Home sales had been improving through the middle of 2013, but stumbled over the last 12 months. Buying has decelerated despite a recent decline in mortgage rates and home prices\u2019 increasing at a slower rate than last year.Sales were initially disrupted by harsh winter weather, but the summer slowdown suggests that financial pressures are now keeping would-be buyers on the sidelines.\u201cThe latest decline raises questions about the housing market strength after the weather-related rebound is behind us,\u201d said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an analyst at BNP Paribas. \u201cHousing will remain an area of concern\u201d for the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, she added.New-home sales fell 8.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 406,000, the Commerce Department said last week.The Realtors group recently reported that sales of used homes increased 2.6 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million homes. It was the first time that sales had been above five million since October, yet the pace of buying remained below last year\u2019s level of 5.1 million.Economists generally consider annual home sales of 5.5 million to be consistent with a healthy housing market.Still, there are indications that sales could pick up. Along with the arrival of spring, average mortgage rates have dropped to 4.13 percent, down from a 52-week high of 4.58 percent, according to Freddie Mac.The rate of average price gains has slowed to 4.3 percent year-over-year, according to the Realtors group. That is down from gains in the double digits. But wage growth has barely kept pace with inflation, eating into how much income people have to spend and save for down payments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aims of Donor Are Shadowed by Past in Coal", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo environmentalists across Australia, it is a baffling anachronism in an era of climate change: the construction of a 4,000-acre mine in New South Wales that will churn out carbon-laden coal for the next 30 years.The mine\u2019s groundbreaking, in a state forest this year, inspired a veteran to stand in front of a bulldozer and a music teacher to chain himself to a piece of excavation equipment.But an examination of those investments shows that even after his highly public divestment, the coal-related projects his firm bankrolled will generate tens of millions of tons of carbon pollution for years, if not decades, to come.Over the past 15 years, Mr. Steyer\u2019s fund, Farallon Capital Management, has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China, records and interviews show.The expected life span of those facilities, some of which may run through 2030, could cloud Mr. Steyer\u2019s image as an environmental savior and the credibility of his clean-energy message, which has won him access to the highest levels of American government. A few weeks ago, Mr. Steyer, 56, joined President Obama for an intimate group dinner at the White House that ran into the early morning hours, according to people told of the event.The New York Times examined the operations of coal-mining companies in which Farallon invested or to which it lent money during Mr. Steyer\u2019s stewardship, which coincided with growing demand and prices for coal. Together, those mines have increased their annual production by about 70 million tons since they received money from the hedge fund, according to corporate records, government data and interviews with industry experts.That is more than the amount of coal consumed annually by Britain.\u201cI am disappointed, I have to say,\u201d said Dale Jamieson, a professor of environmental studies at New York University, who said he admired Mr. Steyer\u2019s campaign to curb climate change. When it comes to large-scale investments in coal, Professor Jamieson said, \u201cyou can\u2019t undo what you\u2019ve done in the past.\u201dFarallon is still invested in carbon-generating industries, and the aides declined to say whether Mr. Steyer had asked it to sell those holdings, a request that would presumably hold significant sway given his role as a founder.The Australian mine, known as Maules Creek, illustrates the complexities of Mr. Steyer\u2019s efforts to distance himself. Farallon was a major investor in a 2009 deal aimed at developing the mine, lending an Australian entrepreneur hundreds of millions of dollars to buy out the previous owner, according to people involved in the transaction. Eventually, the entrepreneur took the mine public, turning Farallon\u2019s investment into a large profit. An executive involved in the original deal estimated that Farallon earned tens of millions of dollars.Farallon remains an investor in Maules Creek to this day. Mining at the site, expected to start in 2015, will last up to 30 years, yield as much as 13 million tons of coal a year and generate about 30 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, according to Ian Lowe, the former head of the School of Science at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. (The company that owns the mine, Whitehaven Coal, disputes the carbon dioxide projection.)Given Mr. Steyer\u2019s reputation as an active environmentalist, Australian opponents of the mine were startled to learn of his firm\u2019s role as an early investor.\u201cIt\u2019s gobsmacking,\u201d Philip Spark, president of the Northern Inland Council for the Environment, a nonprofit trying to stop construction of the mine, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that such a person could have been involved in this project.\u201dMark Carnegie, an investment banker in Australia who was involved in the Maules Creek deal, said he could sense even then that Mr. Steyer was struggling to reconcile his motivations as a profit-seeking investor with his growing anxieties about the environment.But the investment was financially irresistible. \u201cIt was a hard thing to turn down,\u201d Mr. Carnegie said. \u201cIt was a huge winning bet for Farallon.\u201dWhen Mr. Steyer founded NextGen Climate in 2013, the environmental movement found what it had long lacked and sorely wanted: a determined political combatant with a willingness to raise and spend campaign money at a level never before seen by traditional environmental groups. An Upper East Side native educated at Yale and Stanford, Mr. Steyer glided through jobs at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in the 1980s before plunging into the relatively new world of hedge funds. Since he founded it in 1986, Farallon \u2014 named for a set of rocky islands off the California coast \u2014 has grown to manage as much as $37 billion, from about $15 million in the beginning.Throughout the early 2000s, the fund offered large, typically high-interest loans to companies seeking to buy undervalued coal mines in Indonesia, which was still rebounding from the Asian financial crisis. The buyouts proved profitable for Farallon, but they also encouraged the new owners of the mines to increase coal production in order to generate revenue to repay the loans, according to executives who participated in the buyouts.In 2004, for example, Farallon lent at least $60 million to a group of investors buying an Indonesian coal-mining company called Berau, giving the fund a right to a stake in the company, according to people involved in the deal. Within a few years, Berau\u2019s value had doubled, delivering a hefty return for Farallon. Berau quickly sped up its operations: Its coal production soared to 20 million tons in 2012 from about nine million tons in 2004.Roger Suyama, a former Merrill Lynch banker who was involved in the Berau buyout, said Farallon was \u201clike an anchor in the Indonesian coal industry.\u201d\u201cBy drawing money to an overlooked sector,\u201d he said, \u201cthey helped expand the coal industry there.\u201dAs with those in coal mining, Mr. Steyer\u2019s investments in coal-fired power will reverberate far into the future.Farallon invested in a subsidiary of Indiabulls, an Indian financial conglomerate, in 2008, just as the subsidiary began expanding into coal-fired power. Two years later, Indiabulls began construction on two massive coal-fired power plants: the 2,700-megawatt Amravati plant in central India and the 1,350-megawatt Nasik plant outside Mumbai. When completed, Amravati is expected to be one of the largest coal-fired power plants in India.Indiabulls has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with a government-owned electric utility, locking in two decades of carbon pollution. It took a similar approach in China.In 2007, Farallon provided funds for the sale of Meiya Power, an electric utility that operates four large coal-fired power plants, which collectively produce about 7,000 megawatts of power. Combined, the completed Indiabulls and Meiya plants will produce about 60 million tons of carbon pollution a year, according to Dallas Burtraw, an analyst at Resources for the Future, a research organization in Washington.The Republican candidates Mr. Steyer is targeting in this year\u2019s midterm elections said such investments deeply undermined his cause.\u201cIt blows a hole in his credibility,\u201d said Representative Cory Gardner, a Senate candidate in Colorado, whose Democratic rival, Senator Mark Udall, has benefited from $100,000 from Mr. Steyer\u2019s political organization. \u201cYou can\u2019t claim you are a great environmentalist and invest in the very same technologies you are railing against.\u201dRepublican leaders and their allies are drawing up plans to cast Mr. Steyer as a hypocrite. In North Carolina, Thom Tillis, a Senate candidate, said he intended to portray his opponent, Senator Kay Hagan, and Mr. Steyer as \u201cpeople who say one thing and do another.\u201dIn interviews, several prominent environmentalists argued that Mr. Steyer\u2019s unrivaled spending to support climate-change policies outweighed the impact of the carbon pollution unleashed by his past investments.\u201cThis is precisely what we want people to do: sell investments in fossil fuels and get to work solving the problem of climate change,\u201d said Bill McKibben, a founder of the group 350.org, which pushes financial institutions to divest from fossil fuels.Supporters point to the $25 million campaign Mr. Steyer organized four years ago to defeat a California ballot initiative that would have gutted the state\u2019s landmark climate-change law. The law remained in place and is projected to cut about 30 million tons of carbon emissions by 2020. This year, Mr. Steyer plans to spend four times as much in support of Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to reduce emissions from about 600 coal-fired power plants \u2014 a plan expected to eliminate 220 million tons of carbon pollution a year.But detractors see hypocrisy: As coal linked to Mr. Steyer\u2019s previous investments burns in Asian power plants, he is spending a fortune earned from those investments to pursue a green agenda that would shutter similar plants in the United States.\u201cIf my side wins, it will create real costs for ordinary working people,\u201d said Professor Jamieson of N.Y.U. \u201cHits to their welfare will not be compensated by stacks of money.\u201dUnlike Mr. Steyer, he said, \u201cthey won\u2019t have options.\u201dMs. Wong, the spokeswoman for Mr. Steyer\u2019s political organization, said Mr. Steyer had invested heavily both in creating jobs in the emerging clean-energy industry and in training workers for those positions.Back in Australia, environmentalists wondered what Mr. Steyer had to say about the giant new coal mine financed by his hedge fund. Would he try to stop it?Blair Palese, an environmental leader in Australia, urged Mr. Steyer to \u201cget Farallon to step back and get out of this investment.\u201d\u201cIt could be 30 years of coal production,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can we keep doing this?\u201dAdvertisement"}

But now, 20 years later, the few that were tried and are still in jail have become eligible for parole, igniting a debate about what this means for the country\u2019s much-vaunted reconciliation project.The debate is especially frenzied because the racial hierarchy these men were defending when they committed their barbarous acts is still largely intact, even if the lives of many black people have improved since 1994.These conversations are edging us closer to a national catharsis, an emotional release that will only be possible when these men join apartheid\u2019s other monsters who already walk among us, free, like Adriaan Vlok (who ordered killings and bombings while serving as minister of law and order in the late 1980s) and the notorious Wouter Basson (who spearheaded the apartheid regime\u2019s biological and chemical weapons program). In the ensuing clarity, the reverence with which our supposedly miraculous transition from apartheid is beheld might fall away, allowing us to finally ask meaningful questions about whether truth and reconciliation actually served the interests of justice and the greater good, and challenge the racial and economic hierarchy that remains in place.Earlier this year, everyone was talking about the parole application of Clive Derby-Lewis, a Conservative Party politician who conspired with Janusz Walus to assassinate the anti-apartheid hero Chris Hani in 1993. In the past few weeks, discussions have centered on the possible release of Eugene de Kock, one of the apartheid police force\u2019s most notorious assassins.Many South Africans, myself included, denounced the idea that a man dubbed \u201cPrime Evil\u201d could so easily be paroled from a double life sentence for six murders and an additional 212 years for other criminal acts.Others, including some journalists and academics, who worked on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, disagreed. Their argument was that Mr. de Kock\u2019s confessions over the years had revealed truths about apartheid atrocities we might not have known otherwise.Moreover, they say, the failure of successive post-1994 governments to prosecute those who had snubbed the truth commission or had been denied amnesty resulted in a selective application of justice borne disproportionately by the likes of Mr. de Kock. After all, he cooperated with the commission, but was denied amnesty for some of his crimes, including kidnapping, assault and the murders of five men, one of which he tried to conceal by blowing up the body of the victim. The commission ruled that these were not political crimes. It\u2019s a moot point for now because the justice minister has turned down Mr. de Kock\u2019s application. But the rejection is a mere technicality that will likely only delay his release for a year. And that means that the moral arguments about punishment and parole for apartheid\u2019s assassins aren\u2019t going away. Proponents of parole rely on a strict reading of current laws with no consideration for the greater social context. They admit that many victims of apartheid-era human rights abuses were denied justice. And, worse, they seem to be admitting that these victims won\u2019t ever have justice, which would mean the commission was little more than a glorified exercise to whitewash apartheid.The argument against parole is more complex. It hinges on the idea that apartheid crimes had immediate victims but also many other victims, who were harmed by unjust laws that dispossessed them of assets like land and homes, and denied them access to economic opportunities. Some observers erroneously see the anti-parole argument as simple racial bloodlust or a call for vengeance. Indeed, a friend of mine recently wondered aloud if those of us who are appalled by the prospect of Mr. de Kock\u2019s release were, out of some misplaced racial solidarity, appropriating the anger felt by the slain Mr. Hani\u2019s widow and the mother of a young lawyer who Mr. de Kock killed with a tape-recorder bomb. These women have not forgiven the men who killed their loved ones. My friend reminded me that I was only a child at the height of Mr. de Kock\u2019s state-sponsored terror campaign. I never suffered directly by his hand. And I\u2019d only just turned 13 when Mr. Hani was assassinated, and share no personal connection to his family. The only voices that should count in the parole decision, according to this view, are those of the people injured by these men and the families of those they killed.I am glad he said this, because I suspect it is what many people are thinking quietly. But to reduce this debate to vengefulness or to curtly say matters of justice cannot be decided by public sentiment is short-sighted. Public engagement was the foundation on which the South Africa transition was built. To dismiss it now while admitting that justice eluded us in 1994 is foolhardy.Moreover, the commission\u2019s definitions of victim and perpetrator were too narrow. The brutal atrocities committed by Mr. de Kock and others were not simply random acts of violence disconnected from the larger criminal enterprise that was apartheid \u2014 a system that victimized everybody classified \u201cnon-white\u201d and continues to do so indirectly through the persistence of the social hierarchy it created.According to this narrow view of victimhood, someone like me \u2014 born in an impoverished township that served as a cheap migrant-labor reserve for the apartheid economy \u2014 couldn\u2019t possibly be a victim of Mr. de Kock\u2019s actions. Nor could the children born there and in other black communities over the past 20 years, even though they still suffer the effects of the actions and decisions made by apartheid-era politicians and their lackeys. But they, too, are victims. The clash over Mr. de Kock\u2019s parole application is about much more than his fate alone. And I can only hope that in a year\u2019s time, when his parole is once again up for consideration, those defending his right to walk free have more to offer than merely saying the ship has sailed on justice for apartheid\u2019s victims \u2014 all 47 million of them.

{"Headline": "German Proposal Seeks to Sharply Curtail Fracking", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s ministers for energy and the environment are seeking a ban on shale gas and oil drilling over the next seven years because of worries that the practice could pollute drinking water and damage the environment.Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government had planned to introduce legislation in the autumn to regulate hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, bringing an end to a de facto moratorium on the practice.But Barbara Hendricks, minister for the environment and a member of the Social Democratic Party, part of the governing coalition, said at a news conference on Friday that a framework of key points on the legislation agreed to with Sigmar Gabriel, the economy and energy minister, would result in the \u201cstrictest regulations we have ever set.\u201d\u201cThere will be no fracking for economic purposes in Germany in the near future,\u201d Ms. Hendricks said. But she said that shale drilling could be used for exploration.Ms. Merkel\u2019s center-right Christian Democrats have yet to weigh in on the proposal by the energy and environment ministers.Opposition to fracking runs deep in Germany. Worries that shale extraction can pollute drinking water and damage the environment have turned public opinion against the practice, even though many people are facing rising electricity prices, a result of Germany\u2019s decision to wean itself off nuclear energy and focus more on renewable sources.Yet business leaders also worry that Germany risks jeopardizing its position as an industrial leader if it refuses to consider exploring its shale-gas reserves.In an editorial published in the Rheinische Post newspaper on Thursday, Ulrich Grillo, president of the Federation of German Industries, warned against ignoring the potential of Germany\u2019s natural gas reserves.\u201cWe will not gain knowledge by bans or by waiting,\u201d Mr. Grillo wrote. \u201cIt is time that politicians give the technological advances a chance within responsible measures. The ball is in the politicians\u2019 court to create the necessary security for citizens and investors.\u201dGermany is largely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. But the Federal Natural Resources Agency, a government organization, has estimated that Germany has 2.3 trillion cubic meters, or 81 trillion cubic feet, of shale gas, enough to supply domestic consumption for about 30 years.The proposed regulations would uphold bans on drilling in areas near water sources, though conventional oil and gas drilling would be allowed.Advertisement"}

We don\u2019t have to search for \u201cmoderates\u201d in Ukraine. Millions there have already both fought for and voted to align their country with the free markets and free people of the European Union.In Brussels, on Friday, the newly elected Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, signed a trade pact with the European Union that will lower tariffs on Ukrainian exports to the 28-nation E.U. market in return for Ukraine implementing anti-corruption, transparency and quality-control reforms designed to bring its economy up to Western standards. It was the same deal that Poroshenko\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Yanukovych, refused to sign last November under pressure from President Vladimir Putin of Russia. That set off the revolution in Kiev\u2019s main square that eventually toppled Yanukovych and ignited a rebellion by Putin-directed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Which is why only hours after the deal was signed, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Grigory Karasin, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as ominously warning that the E.U.-Ukraine accord would have \u201cserious consequences.\u201d In denying Ukrainians the right to choose their own economic and political path, Putin shows how dumb and clever he is at the same time. He is dumb in believing that, in this connected world of newly empowered citizens, he can enjoy the same \u201csphere of influence\u201d that Russia had in Central Europe in the days of the czars. Sorry. If a leader wants to have a sphere of influence today \u2014 in this age of \u201cpeople of influence\u201d \u2014 he either has to earn it by how he behaves or take it all by force. In Ukraine, Putin is in incapable of the former and \u2014 for now \u2014 doesn\u2019t dare do the latter. The czars never had to deal with people of influence who could crowdfund their own drone.But Putin is also clever. Or as the Russian analyst Vladimir Frolov put it in The Moscow Times: \u201cPresident Vladimir Putin may fail to secure his goal of derailing Ukraine\u2019s association agreement with the E.U., but at home he has already cashed in on his Ukrainian political strategy by completely resetting Russia\u2019s national conversation. His principal achievement has been to eliminate any meaningful debate on alternative futures for Russia. Less than a year ago, there was still political space to advance democratic alternatives to Putin\u2019s system.\u201dHowever, the Russian seizure of Crimea and its proxy war in Ukraine, added Frolov, \u201ctransformed the national conversation from a healthy debate on Putin\u2019s presidential performance into a toxic discussion on war and Russia\u2019s enemies. Moscow\u2019s propaganda has successfully painted Ukraine\u2019s popular uprising against state capture by a corrupt clique as a \u2018U.S.-sponsored fascist coup.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, if Putin \u201cis fighting Nazis in Ukraine, then by extension anyone who disagrees with him could be a Nazi collaborator and an enemy of Russia. This closes the political space for all alternative visions for Russia except as a revisionist empire hostile to the West.\u201d\u0095Advertisement"}

And with its glades of abstract patterning, eddying pools of woven fiber, and projected images of water sluicing through galleries, it\u2019s visually the coolest. It\u2019s the first exhibition of contemporary art in eight years at an institution known for its scholarly examinations of historical, often Western, decorative arts and design. (A second, smaller show on view now, \u201cCarrying Coca: 1,500 Years of Andean Chuspas,\u201d is closer to that model.) And it was assembled fast, in less than a year, after an unexpected change in schedule. Winging it can produce magic; it did here. Organized by Jos\u00e9 Roca, artistic director of Flora ars+natura in Bogot\u00e1, and the Colombian writer Alejandro Martin and atmospherically installed on three floors of the center\u2019s townhouse, the show has a distinctive texture and tone. Its mix of poetry, politics and everyday life recalls the \u201cmagical realist\u201d style attributed to the novels of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, that great lover and traveler of Colombia\u2019s waterways. \u201cFlorentino Ariza was surprised by the changes, and would be even more surprised the following day, when navigation became more difficult, and he realized that the Magdalena, father of waters, one of the great rivers of the world, was only an illusion of memory.\u201dThe words are from Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s 1985 novel, \u201cLove in the Time of Cholera,\u201d in which a character revisits, by boat, a grand waterway that had enchanted him decades earlier but was now unrecognizable, its forests leveled, its wildlife gone, its waters choked with trash.The gallery beyond is contrastingly dark. Sheets of paper, tinted in rich earth tones, cover three walls; a suspended overhead rack hung with dried plant fiber forms a low ceiling. In the context of the show, the installation, titled \u201cColor Amazonia,\u201d is art. In the mind of its creator, the painter turned ethnobotanist Susana Mejia, it\u2019s material evidence of the seven years she spent with indigenous communities along the Amazon studying their use of brilliant vegetable dyes.A few years ago, Mr. Lizarazo hired members of the rural Inga community to integrate colored beadwork, their specialty, into his designs. The transfer of an old art form into a new setting was a success. But no culture has a corner on innovation. When he wanted to buy a traditional wood-carved Inga canoe, the owners agreed but insisted on covering the boat\u2019s exterior with beading. The unheard-of project took six months of steady labor to complete; the boat, with its resplendent surface, is in the show.David Consuegra (1939-2004), one of Colombia\u2019s best-known graphic artists, had a Western Modernist art training in the United States. (He went to Yale.) But after returning to Bogot\u00e1, he turned his attention to local history and developed abstract designs derived from decorative patterns on pre-Hispanic metalwork. Using this hybrid visual language, he created logos for some of Colombia\u2019s leading cultural institutions and, in a steady flow over several decades, established a national graphic identity.The retooling of old forms to new times and new uses is the fundamental subject of \u201cCarrying Coca,\u201d a small exhibition on the fourth floor. Organized by Nicola Sharratt, a postdoctoral fellow at the center, it zeros in on a single type of object: purselike woven bags called chuspas used in Andean regions to hold coca, a chewable, sociable stimulant made from crushed leaves. You won\u2019t want to miss the show. It\u2019s tightly argued, engagingly illustrated and has a scholarly depth and density that the larger exhibition doesn\u2019t try for.\u201cWaterweavers\u201d runs to Aug. 10 and \u201cCarrying Coca\u201d to Aug. 3 at Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan; 212-501-3000; bgc.bard.edu.

{"Headline": "Today\u2019s Titans Can Learn From Fall of U.S. Steel", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceIt has been 55 years since bitter labor relations exploded into one of the longest and most debilitating strikes the United States has ever seen.Half a million steelworkers walked out in July 1959, threatening to throw the nation back into recession. \u201cIt would,\u201d said a statement issued by R. Conrad Cooper, a United States Steel official who led the industry\u2019s bargaining committee, \u201ctake a complete surrender of all the economic and other principles for which we stand\u201d for the company to agree to the union\u2019s demands for raises without significant changes in work rules.In October, with no deal in sight, President Dwight D. Eisenhower invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to force workers back to their jobs. \u201cIf permitted to continue, this strike would imperil the national health and safety,\u201d he said. Limited steel production resumed after the Supreme Court upheld that action in November, but it was not until January 1960 that the strike was finally settled.U.S. Steel was the first billion-dollar corporation when it was created in 1901 by J. P. Morgan. In 1959 it was still the seventh most valuable company in the country. Its profits were high and rising, making it hard for the industry to credibly claim workers were being greedy, and its executives seemed to exude haughtiness.But it was the run-up to that strike, as well as the eventual terms of the settlement, that paved the way for the decline of the company and the industry it led. The episode opened the door for surging imports and eventually for wage increases that the companies could ill afford.This week the decline in importance of U.S. Steel was illustrated by the fact that it went all but unnoticed when the company was unceremoniously removed from the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. By the time it was kicked out, U.S. Steel\u2019s stock market value was lower than that of any of the other 499 companies. That value, $3.8 billion, was about 30 percent less than in 1959 \u2014 and that does not take inflation into account.The United States economy is no longer so dependent on heavy manufacturing, a development that would have taken place even if the men running U.S. Steel had far more foresight than they did. But they might have coped with it far better than they did. They might have found a way to better use newer technology that enabled companies like Nucor, which remains in the S.&P. 500 and whose market value is four times that of U.S. Steel, to prosper making steel.More broadly, the descent of U.S. Steel from all powerful to also-ran might be worth contemplating by those who now seem to be astride the world economy, a list that could include companies in Wall Street, Silicon Valley and China.Michelle Applebaum, a now-retired steel analyst whom I have relied upon for insights since the 1980s, when she was at Salomon Brothers, says that one reason the 1959 strike proved disastrous for the big steel companies was that it showed customers they had choices.In those days nearly the entire industry negotiated at the same time, and there was talk of a strike for months in advance. Customers whose own operations would have to shut down without steel sought to build up stockpiles, and that meant dealing with foreign steel makers who previously had made minimal inroads in the United States market. Those stockpiles enabled the economy to come through better than expected. The Pentagon\u2019s fears of a crisis in national defense capability were not realized.When the strike did end, workers received minimal wage increases, but they also obtained a cost-of-living provision to ensure that wages and benefits kept up with inflation. That would prove to be valuable for them in later years. Steel users had learned how to deal with imported steel, a lesson they did not forget.In the next round of steel talks, in 1962, the administration of President John F. Kennedy leaned on the union to accept what was viewed as a modest settlement. President Kennedy hailed it as \u201cnoninflationary.\u201dDays later, Roger M. Blough, U.S. Steel\u2019s chairman and chief executive, called the White House and said he needed to meet with the president that day. The fact that Mr. Blough could arrange such a meeting without disclosing what it was about was an indication of the company\u2019s power. The fact that he felt it necessary showed he knew the announcement he was about to make was hardly routine: U.S. Steel was raising prices.The president told a news conference the next day the price increase was a \u201cwholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest.\u201d He added: \u201cSome time ago I asked each American what he would do for his country, and I asked the steel companies. In the last 24 hours we had their answer.\u201dThe Justice Department said it would investigate possible antitrust violations. So did a Senate committee. Administration officials called other steel companies to try to persuade them not to go along with the price increase. Most did raise prices, including Bethlehem Steel, whose president, Edmund F. Martin, had been quoted as telling reporters just before the U.S. Steel announcement that \u201cthere shouldn\u2019t be any price rise.\u201d The company said he had been misquoted. F.B.I. agents were dispatched to interview the reporters to see whether they stood by their reports, awakening one of them at 3 a.m. The full-court press worked. Within days, Inland Steel said it would not go along, and other companies soon backed down. Senator Barry Goldwater, who was planning to run against Kennedy in 1964, said the president\u2019s actions were \u201csomething you\u2019d expect in a police state.\u201dThe steel industry since then has experienced its ups and down, but there have been more downs than ups. U.S. Steel management over the years invested in the oil industry \u2014 at a particularly bad time \u2014 and expanded internationally to Eastern Europe with transactions that did not prove to be very profitable. The oil investments did work out eventually, but by then the company had been intimidated by Carl C. Icahn into issuing a new class of shares covering the oil interests. When the company split in two in 2001, the oil company, Marathon Oil, was worth far more than the steel company. The long-suffering owners of U.S. Steel\u2019s common stock realized no benefit from the oil investment.But Ms. Applebaum, the analyst, says U.S. Steel is a success story, at least on a relative basis. There is a long list of big steel makers that have been through bankruptcy court, but U.S. Steel is not on it. The company, she said, saved itself through \u201ctight capital spending, prudent asset divestitures and a number of rationalizations through the years.\u201dA U.S. Steel spokeswoman turned aside my request for an interview with the current chief executive, Mario Longhi, and said the company had no comment on its expulsion from the S.&P. 500, of which it had been an original member.Mr. Longhi, who took over as chief executive last year, probably can\u2019t get a White House appointment without saying why he wants one. But at least he did not have to face an angry president this week when the company, according to American Metal Market, told customers that it was raising prices on flat rolled steel. The trade publication said that move was a surprise and questioned whether the price increase would stick.No one in Washington seems to have noticed.Had Mr. Longhi agreed to talk to me, I might have asked if he thought being ignored was worse than being hated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japanese Nuclear Plant Is First to Get Go-Ahead Under New Rules", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 A nuclear plant in southern Japan cleared an initial safety hurdle on Wednesday that could make it the first nuclear facility to restart under new safety regulations designed after the 2011 Fukushima disaster.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is pushing to end the prolonged shutdown of the country\u2019s nuclear plants, which has forced Japan to rely on expensive fossil fuel imports. But he has faced deep wariness from the public, which has slowed his efforts to restart plants that were idled after the disaster.Although the approval is a significant step toward beginning the process of restarting the idled plants, the government might still face hurdles since it has said it will defer to local communities to give final approval on reopening nuclear facilities.The pro-nuclear governor of the prefecture where the plant is located and the mayor of Satsumasendai, the plant\u2019s host city, are likely to approve the decision, but many nearby townships oppose what some consider a hasty restart.More than half of the 30,000 residents in Ichikikushikino, a coastal town about three miles from the plant, recently submitted a petition opposing a restart, citing what they called an unrealistic and inefficient evacuation plan.The decision by the regulators comes at a politically troubled time for Mr. Abe, who already is facing resistance to his plans to reinterpret the pacifist constitution to allow the country\u2019s self-defense forces to take a more assertive role in the region. In addition, although opponents of nuclear power have so far gained little political traction, a candidate backed by Mr. Abe\u2019s party lost a regional election on Sunday, partly over concerns about nuclear safety.The reactors were gradually taken offline after the disaster three years ago as the government promised to enact better safeguards against another catastrophe. But many politicians, including Mr. Abe, worry that Japan\u2019s economy cannot flourish without nuclear power, which they consider a cheaper alternative to fossil fuels.The public, however, remains concerned that regulators will not adequately protect the country from any shortcuts on safety taken by the powerful nuclear industry. Lax oversight and cozy relations have been blamed for helping doom the Fukushima plant.The Nuclear Regulation Authority, an independent watchdog set up in 2012, has been vetting applications for plants to restart for more than a year.Sendai\u2019s approval comes as a relief for Kyushu Electric, which has posted three years of losses and has asked for a bailout by a state-backed bank. It expects to spend more than $3 billion to upgrade its two nuclear plants in southern Japan.The regulators\u2019 decision will also help the broader nuclear industry. The approval process for the five other plants with similar reactors will likely go more quickly, said Tomoya Ichimura of the Nuclear Regulation Authority. Nine of Japan\u2019s electric utilities have applied to restart 19 reactors.Activists and protesters crowded the regulatory commission\u2019s open meeting on Wednesday, yelling at commissioners to vote against the safety review and to halt restarts.In a statement, Greenpeace said that the plant has \u201cno effective evacuation plan for the populations in the region, in particular for the elderly, children and those in hospital, no functioning emergency-response center protected against radiation.\u201dThe nuclear commission will seek public comment on its decision for a month before issuing its final ruling.

It \u201cwould essentially undermine central bank independence,\u201d she said.Republicans criticized what they described as an alarmist response by Ms. Yellen and Democrats to a proposal that they said would do nothing more than modestly increase the Fed\u2019s accountability by requiring greater transparency.They emphasized that the legislation did not specify a particular rule \u2014 it simply told the Fed to pick one. The committee\u2019s chairman, Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, sharply criticized what he described as \u201chowling protests and apocalyptic visions from my Democratic colleagues,\u201d calling them \u201capologists for the status quo.\u201d\u201cThe Fed can set any rule it wishes,\u201d Mr. Hensarling added. \u201cIt can change the rule any time it wishes. It can deviate from the rule any time it wishes.\u201d Under the proposed bill, he added, \u201cit simply has to report and explain this to the rest of us. That\u2019s what transparency and accountability are all about.\u201dThe sparring largely overshadowed questions about the current course of Fed policy, in the face of mounting evidence that the economy has recovered from a rocky winter.The Fed\u2019s Beige Book, an anthology of economic impressions gathered by the Fed regional banks and released two weeks before meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, reported that growth continued at a \u201cmodest to moderate pace\u201d throughout the country.The report was consistent with recent data showing stronger job growth and improvements in manufacturing activity. On Wednesday, the Fed reported that manufacturing output increased 0.1 percent in June, a modest increase that capped a strong quarter during which factory production advanced at an annual rate of 6.7 percent. Another report, from the Labor Department, found producer prices rebounding 0.4 percent last month after a decline of 0.2 percent in May, also showing signs of a healthier manufacturing sector. The government will publish an initial estimate of second-quarter economic activity at the end of July.The evidence of faster growth has revived concerns that the Fed will need to move more quickly. The central bank plans to end the expansion of its bond holdings in October. Ms. Yellen did not give a direct answer on Wednesday to questions about how soon the Fed would begin to raise its key short-term gauge from its current rate near zero, but she did note that most economists expected the Fed to act in the third quarter of 2015.Some Fed officials and economists say that is not soon enough. Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said on Wednesday that the Fed should start raising rates early next year.\u201cWe are at risk of doing what the Fed has too often done: overstaying our welcome by staying too loose too long,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the time to dilute the punch is close upon us.\u201dJames Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, also has warned in recent weeks that he now expects inflation will rise above the Fed\u2019s target next year.Ms. Yellen has largely played down such concerns, describing inflation as muted and unlikely to rebound strongly. She remained primarily concerned about reducing unemployment and expediting the incomplete recovery.Citing \u201csubstantial headwinds\u201d impeding growth, she said, \u201cUntil they are completely gone, it calls for an accommodative monetary policy.\u201dHer testimony to Congress, however, included an acknowledgment that the Fed would act sooner if the recovery, particularly in the labor market, continued to outstrip expectations.The hearing on Wednesday had this debate about current policy as its subtext.The Republican-sponsored bill introduced last week would require the Fed to adopt something like the Taylor Rule, a formula written by the Stanford economist John Taylor that specifies interest rates based on inflation and the gap between actual and potential economic output. The Fed could change the rule, but it would be required to explain deviations.Mr. Taylor said last week that his rule would now require the Fed to set short-term interest rates at around 1.25 percent.Ms. Yellen, in making the case that the Fed needs flexibility, is also arguing that it needs to maintain lower rates to reduce unemployment further.Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who was a co-author of the bill, asked Ms. Yellen whether she had read the legislation, waited for a response, and then said he would refresh her memory. He said the point of the bill was to establish accountability. \u201cWe cannot have an entity within the federal government just operating on a whim,\u201d he said.Ms. Yellen responded that the Fed was \u201cthe most transparent central bank to my knowledge in the world.\u201dDemocrats rallied to Ms. Yellen\u2019s defense, contending that Congress already had sufficient oversight of monetary policy. Maxine Waters of California, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, called it a \u201crecipe for disaster.\u201dDemocrats also urged Ms. Yellen to persist in holding down interest rates.\u201cThe economy is worse than your statement indicates,\u201d Representative Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, told Ms. Yellen. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a person in this room who has waxed eloquently about how everything\u2019s going spectacularly in their district,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd many, many members have told me and spoken about how, in a very large percentage of this country, we\u2019re still in recession.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marlon\u2019s Method", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe title of Susan L. Mizruchi\u2019s Marlon Brando book is a hassle. You don\u2019t want to be seen with anything called \u201cBrando\u2019s Smile.\u201d You just don\u2019t. I read the book the old-fashioned way \u2014 on paper. I read it in restaurants, on the subway and in the park. I read it with the front cover obscured. To dislike the title of the book is to reject its putative premise \u2014 that Brando wasn\u2019t just a sexy slob with no technique but an extremely skilled, deeply intelligent, fiercely perceptive \u201cpublic citizen\u201d who \u201ccarefully controlled his smiles.\u201d Mizruchi seems to be making a case that the modus operandi of one of the movies\u2019 greatest performers can be reduced to the strategic concealment of dental work. But as it happens, \u201cBrando\u2019s Smile\u201d isn\u2019t about Brando\u2019s mouth at all. After the introduction, we don\u2019t hear much about it until the final pages. This business of his smile is just a pretext for the vast amount of research Mizruchi has done in Brando\u2019s archives, and the result is a heavily footnoted chronological assembly of observations, analysis, plot summary, photographs and trivia, written, it must be said, in the manner of a grant proposal. It\u2019s uneven and full of speculative dot \u00adconnecting. What Mizruchi has unearthed \u201cexplains,\u201d \u201cimplies,\u201d \u201csuggests,\u201d \u201cproves\u201d and \u201cconfirms\u201d all that one could ever want to know about her subject. One stated goal is to dispel eight \u201cmyths\u201d about Brando: that greed and ambition made him renounce the theater at the start of the 1950s; that he was ignorant and undereducated; that after 1960 he made movies just for the money; that his resentment of his own fame made him fat; that he was anti-Semitic; that he was a glutton; that he was a political dilettante; and that, at the time of his death in 2004, he was broke and miserable. Mizruchi\u2019s tactic is, in part, to let Brando defend himself. She offers evidence of his reading list in order to present him as passionately curious, informed and less dour than he seemed to be: \u201cBrando\u2019s books and scripts reveal the powerful sense of humor that seemed so at odds with the gloomy characters he played.\u201d She glosses over the fact that he was an atrocious speller to focus on his fascination with history, wildlife, ecology and the writings of Hannah Arendt. The goal of the book \u2014 another one \u2014 is to \u201cprovide insight into the life and mind of an American actor who continues to mesmerize and inspire us for reasons we can now more fully understand.\u201dYou\u2019re asked to reconsider the idea of actor as auteur. According to Mizruchi, Brando made the movies he appeared in better, therefore the films belonged to him. He was a star who insisted on reworking material. This doesn\u2019t make him unique, but access to Brando\u2019s intimate thoughts appears to have gone to Mizruchi\u2019s head. She\u2019s written academic books on the complexities of race, including \u201cBecoming Multicultural: Culture, Economy, and the Novel, 1860-1920.\u201d In this new book, however, she\u2019s an enthusiast first and a critical scholar on matters of race, gender and social politics a very distant second, skipping opportunities to unpack Brando\u2019s performances as nonwhite characters in \u201cViva Zapata!\u201d (1952) and \u201cThe Teahouse of the August Moon\u201d (1956). It\u2019s not that those parts are indefensible; it\u2019s that we\u2019d expect a scholar with Mizruchi\u2019s background to enjoy taking a crack at an interpretation. The same goes for the feminist response to \u201cLast Tango in Paris\u201d (1972), which she dismisses in a sentence.But Mizruchi isn\u2019t interested in analysis. Instead, she provides adulatory close readings of most of Brando\u2019s 40 movies, to explain what each role reveals about Brando the literate, sentient, moral being. She insists that \u201chis extensive reading continued to inform his work and led him to use the Pitcairn Island sequence in \u2018Mutiny on the Bounty\u2019 as an opportunity to explore human behavior in Utopia, and to qualify the moral absolutism in his western \u2018One-Eyed Jacks\u2019 by portraying all the characters as corruptible.\u201d\u201cBrando\u2019s Smile\u201d isn\u2019t a work of historical arts criticism or enriched profiling. It\u2019s \u201cNotes From the Stacks.\u201d It doesn\u2019t make a cogent case for much. Even those eight myths Mizruchi intends to debunk feel exactly like myths, since she makes no attempt to present them as credible problems. And so, most of the book reads like one of those newspaper corrections that refuse to tell you what the original error was, and much of the myth-busting feels like an opportunity for hero-worship. Still, you do leave the book with a better understanding of Brando. It\u2019s Mizruchi who remains confounding. For long stretches, she gives you sentences that need a hot comb. Her section on Brando\u2019s only outing as a director, \u201cOne-Eyed Jacks\u201d (1961), is gnarlier than the film. \u201cThat is the effect of Brando\u2019s artistry,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe depicts life through a most brutal realism but reveals it in a larger context, the vastness and mystery of nature.\u201d Apparently, another effect of Brando\u2019s artistry is knock-kneed writing. Nonetheless, this is a major-ish book. It includes unseen, little-known details about Brando\u2019s work habits, philosophies, sociopolitical causes, states of mind. He shared intense friendships with James Baldwin and Quincy Jones, with whom he discussed race and racial equality. And he and Michael Jackson sat down for a long recorded conversation. Brando was helping make Jackson a better actor. It\u2019s a friendship that makes sense \u2014 they had their galactic, fun-house mirror fame in common.Brando tinkered with the scripts for most of the films he acted in. You find discussions of some of that tinkering in other biographies. But this book departs from sweeping critical assessments, namely Richard Schickel\u2019s disillusioned \u201cBrando: A Life in Our Times,\u201d from 1991. Mizruchi juxtaposes portions of the original scripts against Brando\u2019s alterations, and what emerges over the course of the book \u2014 by, say, the late 1960s with Gillo Pontecorvo\u2019s film \u201cBurn!\u201d \u2014 is a confident star who\u2019d become an increasingly wise artist.He\u2019s reported to have rewritten Don Vito Corleone\u2019s monologues in Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo\u2019s screenplay for \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d Mizruchi reproduces an early version of Corleone\u2019s speech to the undertaker, then the speech Brando delivers in the film. She notes that his version is more eloquent, and she\u2019s right. But you almost don\u2019t need a guide for this material, certainly not one as besotted as Mizruchi appears to be. There\u2019s also a long passage on \u201cThe Ugly American\u201d (1963) in which Brando sums up the value of his character\u2019s wife. She \u201cplays the dramaturgical butler who brings the calling card of plot from the front door to the bedroom.\u201d I\u2019d buy three books of him just doing that.

{"Headline": "Gains Seen for Medicare, but Social Security Holds Steady", "Date": "2014-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Medicare\u2019s financial condition improved significantly in the last year, thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act, but the outlook for Social Security is basically unchanged, the Obama administration said Monday.If Congress makes no change in existing law, officials said, Medicare\u2019s hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted in 2030, four years later than the administration projected in May 2013. The Social Security trust fund, they said, will be depleted in 2033, the same as expected last year.The forecasts were included in the government\u2019s annual report on the two programs, which together account for about 40 percent of federal spending.Medicare spending on hospital care was lower than expected last year, the administration said, and officials have lowered their assumptions about the use of inpatient hospital services in the future.Reports from the trustees \u2014 four federal officials and two public representatives \u2014 are largely prepared by career civil servants, who take pains to provide an objective assessment of the programs\u2019 finances.Social Security provides benefits to 59 million people, and, on average, about 10,000 baby boomers become eligible each day. Payroll taxes and other revenue dedicated to Social Security would be sufficient to pay about three-fourths of promised benefits if its trust fund runs out, administration officials said.The Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, said the reports showed that \u201cSocial Security and Medicare are fundamentally secure.\u201d But he expressed concern about Social Security\u2019s disability program because, he said, its dedicated funds will cover the full amount of promised benefits for only two more years.Mr. Lew endorsed a stopgap solution, which would temporarily reallocate some payroll tax revenue to disability benefits from the surplus built up for retirement benefits. \u201cThere is probably no other alternative that could provide the desired results\u201d in the next two years, Mr. Lew said. Congress approved a similar reallocation in the 1990s.With the aging of the population, the number of Medicare beneficiaries is also growing rapidly. The financial condition of Medicare has benefited from a slowdown in national health spending, attributed in part to the Affordable Care Act, which curbed Medicare payments to many health care providers and encouraged them to find more efficient ways of delivering care. The slow growth of wages and prices, following the economic recession of 2007-09, was also cited by the trustees as a factor restraining the growth of Medicare.Two numbers illustrate the slowdown in Medicare spending.The trustees estimate that the standard monthly Medicare premium will be $104.90 next year, unchanged from 2013 and 2014. In addition, the trustees said that Medicare spending per beneficiary averaged $12,210 last year, the same as in 2012, and it is expected to be about the same in 2015.However, in the coming decade, average spending per Medicare beneficiary is expected to grow about 40 percent, to $17,360 in 2023, with outlays expected to rise much faster for prescription drugs and doctors\u2019 services than for inpatient hospital care.Jeanne M. Lambrew, a health policy coordinator at the White House, said that in 2009, a year before adoption of the health care law, the trustees predicted that the Medicare trust fund would run out of money in 2017. \u201cToday\u2019s new date is 2030,\u201d she said, \u201c13 years later than that projection \u2014 an improvement that is thanks in part to reforms in the Affordable Care Act.\u201dRobert D. Reischauer, one of the public trustees, said the latest projections still indicated that Medicare spending would grow faster than the economy as a whole, workers\u2019 earnings or the incomes of retirees.\u201cUnder current law,\u201d Mr. Reischauer said, \u201cboth of these very important programs are fiscally unsustainable over the long run and will require legislative intervention.\u201dMembers of Congress have discussed the idea of higher premiums for high-income Medicare beneficiaries and a reduction in the annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security. Such proposals often come up in the context of efforts to negotiate a broader agreement on federal spending and taxes, but the prospects of such a deal have shrunk to the vanishing point in this election year.The trustees\u2019 report says that the Social Security trust fund ran a surplus of $32 billion last year and is on track to run another one, increasing its total reserves to nearly $2.8 trillion by the end of this year. The trust fund\u2019s assets will decline at a rapid rate starting in about a decade, the report shows.Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: \u201cThis administration continues to ignore the fast-approaching crisis that Medicare and Social Security face, especially our Social Security disability program. The fact is, without bipartisan action, benefits will be cut.\u201dDemocrats and their allies tend to favor tax changes that could, for example, eliminate the cap on earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax.\u201cIf Congress listens to the American people and requires millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share, the report shows, all benefits can be paid for the next three-quarters of a century and beyond,\u201d said Nancy J. Altman, co-chairwoman of Strengthen Social Security, a coalition that includes many liberal organizations.The chief Medicare actuary, Paul Spitalnic, said that future costs could well be higher than indicated in the report. The 2010 health law reduces the growth of Medicare payments to hospitals and many other providers, on the assumption that they will increase their productivity, but, Mr. Spitalnic said, \u201cthere is a strong possibility that certain of these changes will not be viable in the long range.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Push to Give Steadier Shifts to Part-Timers", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs more workers find their lives upended and their paychecks reduced by ever-changing, on-call schedules, government officials are trying to put limits on the harshest of those scheduling practices.The actions reflect a growing national movement \u2014 fueled by women\u2019s and labor groups \u2014 to curb practices that affect millions of families, like assigning just one or two days of work a week or requiring employees to work unpredictable hours that wreak havoc with everyday routines like college and child care.The recent, rapid spread of on-call employment to retail and other sectors has prompted proposals that would require companies to pay employees extra for on-call work and to give two weeks\u2019 notice of a work schedule.Vermont and San Francisco have adopted laws giving workers the right to request flexible or predictable schedules to make it easier to take care of children or aging parents. Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, is pressing the City Council to take up such legislation. And last month, President Obama ordered federal agencies to give the \u201cright to request\u201d to two million federal workers.The new laws and proposals generally require an employer to discuss a new employee\u2019s situation and to consider scheduling requests, but they do not require companies to accommodate individual schedules. Many businesses have opposed these measures, arguing that they represent improper government intrusion into private operations.In a referendum last year, voters in SeaTac, Wash. \u2014 the community near Seattle that also passed the nation\u2019s highest minimum wage, $15 an hour for some workers \u2014 approved a measure that bars employers from hiring additional part-time workers if any of their existing part-timers want more hours. The move was a response to complaints from workers that they were not scheduled for enough hours to support their families. Some San Francisco lawmakers are seeking to enact a similar regulation.Representative George Miller of California, the senior Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, plans to introduce legislation this summer that would require companies to pay their employees for an extra hour if they were summoned to work with less than 24 hours\u2019 notice. He is also proposing a guarantee of four hours\u2019 pay on days when employees are sent home after just a few hours \u2014 something that happens in many restaurants and retailers when customer traffic is slow.That happened to Mary Coleman. After an hourlong bus commute, she arrived at her job at a Popeyes in Milwaukee only to have her boss order her to go home without clocking in \u2014 even though she was scheduled to work. She was not paid for the day.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more common to put employees in a very uncertain and tenuous position with respect to their schedules, and that ricochets if workers have families or other commitments,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThe employer community always says it abhors uncertainty and unpredictability, but they are creating an employment situation that has huge uncertainty and unpredictability for millions of Americans.\u201dWhile Mr. Miller acknowledges that his bill is unlikely to be enacted anytime soon \u2014 partly because of opposition from business (and a Republican-controlled House), he said the bill would bring attention to what he called often callous scheduling practices. His bill, similar to one in the Senate sponsored by Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, has a \u201cright to request\u201d provision that would bar employers from denying requests from workers with caregiving or school-related conflicts unless they had a \u201cbona fide\u201d business reason.Corporate groups protest that such measures undercut efficiency and profits. \u201cThe hyper-regulation of the workplace by government isn\u2019t conducive to a positive business climate,\u201d said Scott DeFife, an executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association. \u201cThe more complications that government creates for operating a business, the less likely we\u2019ll see a positive business environment that\u2019s good for the economy and increasing jobs.\u201dMr. DeFife pointed out that the daily ebb and flow of customers necessitated flexibility in scheduling.David French, a senior vice president of the National Retail Federation, said many people chose careers in retail because of the flexible work hours.\u201cThese proposals may sound reasonable, but if you unpack them, they could be very harmful,\u201d Mr. French said. \u201cWhere employers and employees now work together to solve scheduling problems, you\u2019ll have a very bureaucratic environment where rigid rules would be introduced.\u201dWhile many of these workers are not unionized, the labor movement has often battled against part-time work and ever-changing schedules. But as unions have grown weaker, employers have felt freer to employ part-timers and use more volatile scheduling. Unions still push for workers to get more hours \u2014 and those pressures are one reason Macy\u2019s and Walmart have adopted programs letting employees claim additional, available shifts by going onto their employers\u2019 websites.In a climate where many retailers, restaurants and other businesses are still struggling after the recession, economists point to the increased uncertainty faced by employees. About 27.4 million Americans work part time. The number of those part-timers who would prefer to work full time has nearly doubled since 2007, to 7.5 million. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, 47 percent of part-time hourly workers ages 26 to 32 receive a week or less of advance notice for their schedule.In a study of the data, two University of Chicago professors found that employers dictated the work schedules for about half of young adults, without their input. For part-time workers, schedules on average fluctuated from 17 to 28 hours a week.\u201cFrontline managers face pressure to keep costs down, but they really don\u2019t have much control over wages or benefits,\u201d said Susan J. Lambert, a University of Chicago professor who interpreted the data. \u201cWhat they have control over is employee hours.\u201dMs. Lambert said flexible, not rigid or unpredictable, hours would become as important an issue as paid family leave. \u201cThe issue of scheduling is going to be the next big effort on improving labor standards,\u201d she said. \u201cTo reduce unpredictability is important to keep women engaged in the labor force.\u201dDavid Chiu, president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, has created a business-labor group that is trying to find the middle ground.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that predictability in hours is important not just to help workers juggle their lives, but for economic security \u2014 to help workers take a second job to live in expensive cities like San Francisco or New York,\u201d Mr. Chiu said. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that we can move forward with policies that work for workers as well as business\u2019s bottom line.\u201dSharlene Santos says her part-time schedule at a Zara clothing store in Manhattan \u2014 ranging from 16 to 24 hours a week \u2014 is not enough. \u201cMaking $220 a week, that\u2019s not enough to live on \u2014 it\u2019s not realistic,\u201d she said.After Ms. Santos and four other Zara workers recently wrote to the company, protesting that they were given too few hours and received just two days\u2019 notice for their schedule, the company promised to start giving them two weeks\u2019 advance notice.Fatimah Muhammad said that at the Joe Fresh clothing store where she works in Manhattan, some weeks she was scheduled to work just one day but was on call for four days \u2014 meaning she had to call the store each morning to see whether it needed her to work that day.\u201cI felt kind of stuck. I couldn\u2019t make plans,\u201d said Ms. Muhammad, who said she was now assigned 25 hours a week.A national campaign \u2014 the Fair Workweek Initiative \u2014 is pushing for legislation to restrict these practices in places including Milwaukee, New York and Santa Clara, Calif. The effort includes the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the United Food and Commercial Workers union and the Retail Action Project, a New York workers\u2019 group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Downed Malaysian Plane, Race and Class in Mexico, and Challenges for a Unified Korea.", "Date": "2014-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersIt is highly probable that pro-Russian rebels operating in eastern Ukraine have been given specialized training by the Russian military in the use of the sophisticated weaponry required to bring down airplanes. In effect, the Russian president and his proxies have declared war on all the nationalities represented on the downed Malaysian airliner. There must be a robust international reckoning. Re \u201cLatin America\u2019s talent for tolerance\u201d (July 11): Enrique Krauze juxtaposes the racial tolerance he sees in Mexico with racial conflicts elsewhere in the region. He fails to note how much such tolerance depends on the willingness of Mexican Indians to internalize \u201ctheir place\u201d within Mexican society. Their conspicuous absence as paying patrons in places that Mexicans regard as middle- or upper-class, white or mestizo, cannot be explained just in terms of the pervasive classism that Mr. Krauze rightly highlights. It reflects a widespread expectation that Mexican Indians can be present in those spaces as nannies or maids, construction workers or parking attendants, but not as equals. Those who have the means to pay and who challenge these norms risk the public humiliation of being turned away, perhaps after being called a racial slur. This may be too large a price to pay for upsetting Mexican \u201cracial tolerance.\u201dIn Mexico race and class are so tightly intertwined that they are hard to disentangle. Just look at nearly any telenovela, where the higher the class position of the characters depicted, the whiter their skin color and the more stereotypically European their features. The writer is an associate professor of sociology and interim director of Latina and Latino Studies at Northwestern University. Mr. Krauze argues that Americans should learn from Latin America\u2019s experience regarding racial tolerance. But his analysis \u2014 mostly drawing from Mexico\u2019s history \u2014 is deceptive on three grounds. First, it is simply false that discrimination in Mexico is based on class, as this ignores, for example, the tolerance for racial slurs prevailing in the country. Second, his column does not acknowledge the harsh treatment migrants from Central America receive at the hands of the authorities when crossing Mexico\u2019s southern border. Lastly, he ignores the progress made in the United States in terms of both racial attitudes and opportunities for minorities since the Civil Rights era \u2014 which perhaps were the result of the overt and violent nature of racism in this country. Instead, arguments like the one Mr. Krauze advances serve to perpetuate the myopia regarding Mexico\u2019s culture of tolerance for intolerance.Re \u201cLet North Korea collapse\u201d (Opinion, June 17): Sue Mi Terry is optimistic about the rise of a free economy if North Korea were to fall and argues that \u201cover time, a unified Korea could emerge as regional consumer and industrial powerhouse much like Germany.\u201d I disagree with her analogy but acknowledge that human rights would massively improve after a collapse of the North. Ms. Terry predicts that the North would see tremendous foreign investment and revenues from exports because of its vast mineral resources and a young labor force. But less economically developed countries like North Korea often fail to eliminate widespread poverty, improve standards of living or create well-balanced market economies. The increasing rivalry between China and the United States and the heightened sensitivity of China over territorial issues also would make it quite difficult to build a unified Korea. A mixture of regional disputes, extensive corruption and multiple market failures would make a successful unified Korean economy impossible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sarkozy, Plagued by Accusations, Sees Left-Wing Plot to Destroy Him", "Date": "2014-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From FrancePARIS \u2014 Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France who suffered the unprecedented indignity last week of being hauled before an investigative panel for 15 hours of questioning, has angrily denounced the inquiry and cast himself as the victim of a vast left-wing plot to destroy him.\u201cThere are things that are being organized,\u201d Mr. Sarkozy, a conservative who was France\u2019s head of state from 2007 to 2012, hinted darkly. He called the allegations against him \u201cpreposterous.\u201dDoes he have a case?Many of his supporters and some legal experts say he does, and express suspicions about the unusually aggressive legal tactics used in the case as well as its timing, which could torpedo his possible run for the presidency in 2017.The Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, has insisted that the government is not behind the case. But critics, not least of them Mr. Sarkozy, say that such claims ring hollow in a country where the internecine battles between right and left are virulent.Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s supporters argue that the timing of the case against Mr. Sarkozy is no coincidence. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a Socialist and longtime political foe of Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s, is buffeted by record-low approval ratings, a sluggish economy and infighting among his party ranks. S\u00e9bastien Huyghe, a parliamentarian and member of Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s rightist Union for a Popular Movement party, argued that Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s misfortunes were calculated to revive Mr. Hollande\u2019s own sagging political prospects.\u201cI think that people on the left are significantly concerned by Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s political comeback,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve named judges who don\u2019t like Sarkozy, and it is very insidious. I am convinced that the president of the republic is deeply afraid of Mr. Sarkozy. His greatest fear is to run against him in 2017, and he will use any means possible to beat him.\u201dWhile there is no evidence of Mr. Hollande\u2019s direct involvement in the case, some see a personal vendetta at work. The bitter rivalry between Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande has sometimes boiled over into barely concealed hatred. During the 2012 presidential campaign, Mr. Sarkozy called Mr. Hollande \u201cuseless\u201d and a liar, and said he had not achieved anything in 30 years of politics. Mr. Hollande, in turn, described Mr. Sarkozy as a \u201csalopard,\u201d or bastard.The political timing of the case also raises questions, coming at a decidedly bad time for Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s party, battered by a leadership crisis and adrift politically. Before the latest scandal, Mr. Sarkozy was viewed as a likely candidate to lead the party, which will choose a leader in November. Now that he is tainted, his prospects are significantly diminished.Though evidence of a conspiracy is circumstantial at best, few disagree that Mr. Sarkozy is despised on the left. Both as a former interior minister, and then as president, he deeply infuriated the left by advocating free markets, espousing a zero-tolerance approach to crime and characterizing the judiciary as an insipid clique too soft on criminals.Some political observers have suggested that his contempt for the judiciary is coming back to haunt him. Mr. Sarkozy sought last week to cast doubts on one of the judges on the case, Claire Th\u00e9paut, noting that she was a member of a leftist magistrate\u2019s union. Others have observed that the newly established anticorruption prosecutor\u2019s office pursuing the case against Mr. Sarkozy was established under a Socialist government in January.Jean-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bertolus, a leading commentator for the French broadcaster Itele, noted that in the Sarkozy camp, Ms. Th\u00e9paut was considered \u201ca personal enemy.\u201d Asked about Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s election defeat in 2012 by a journalist for Mediapart, a news website, Ms. Th\u00e9paut replied, \u201cWhat is certain is that we hope to return to calm, serenity and confidence.\u201dThough apparently no fan of the former president, she is not precluded from judging the case, and the French news media characterized Ms. Th\u00e9paut as a serious and respected judge. The magistrate\u2019s union told Le Monde, the daily newspaper, that while Ms. Th\u00e9paut had been engaged with the union, she had never been a member, nor campaigned against Mr. Sarkozy. Fran\u00e7oise Martres, the president of the magistrate\u2019s union, also rose to her defense, saying that \u201ca judge without opinions doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dFor all the talk of conspiracy, many analysts see Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s attempt to portray himself as a victim as a disingenuous tactic aimed at drawing attention away from the legal challenges that he faces. \u201cIt is hard to see this as a conspiracy when you have so many cases accumulated against Mr. Sarkozy,\u201d said \u00c9rik Emptaz, editor in chief of Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9, an influential satirical newspaper. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that the tactics used against him have been spectacularly aggressive.\u201dThe case against Mr. Sarkozy hinges on whether he, with the help of his lawyer, Thierry Herzog, sought to obtain information from an influential appeals court judge, Gilbert Azibert, about a legal inquiry into the financing of his 2007 election campaign. At issue is whether Mr. Azibert fed Mr. Sarkozy information and whether in return he was promised a post in Monaco. But critics of the case note that Mr. Azibert never received any job in the principality, and had no direct links to any of the cases under scrutiny.The tactics used by investigators could prove problematic in court, legal experts said. The bulk of the case against Mr. Sarkozy hinges on secret recordings of his private conversations with his lawyer that may breach lawyer-client privilege.Pierre-Olivier Sur, president of the Paris bar association, told the right-leaning Le Figaro newspaper that under French law, secret recordings of private conversations made in 2013 were not admissible for a case dating from years earlier. \u201cThe attempt to use 2013 calls to shed light on facts that happened in 2006 creates doubts about the real goal of these wiretaps,\u201d he said.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Are Hopeful Improving Job Numbers Will Sway Voters in Fall", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 While the jobs report for June released on Thursday sent stock markets soaring as investors celebrated another sign of a rebounding economy, voters are hardly so easily moved.\u00a0Yet for President Obama and congressional Democrats, the numbers kindled hopes of a lift to their party\u2019s downbeat prospects in this fall\u2019s midterm elections.Even as international crises dominate the news and the attention of the White House and Congress, the economy continues to be the main concern of most voters, polls show. So Mr. Obama, who struggles daily to balance the two imperatives,\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0appeared at a local hub for technology innovators and hailed the hiring report as evidence of a positive trend.Republicans, however, remain confident of winning control of both chambers of Congress for the final two years of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, and emphasized other, negative data \u2014 the president\u2019s continued slump in the polls, and a majority\u2019s disapproval of his overall job performance as well as his handling of the economy. Reince Priebus, the Republican party chairman, in a statement, said \u201cmillions of our fellow Americans think the American dream is slipping away because they can\u2019t find good jobs in the Obama economy.\u201dAnd, Republicans argue, the four months left until November are too few to shift the political winds Democrats face.\u201cYears of past data tell us the election environment in an off-year election is set by June or July,\u201d said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. \u201cWith the president\u2019s ratings lower than they were in October of 2010\u201d \u2014 a month before the previous midterm elections, in which Republicans scored big gains \u2014 \u201cthe Democrats will be facing very difficult political terrain this fall.\u201dDemocrats acknowledge that they have a midterm disadvantage typical for the party that holds the White House. But they dispute that the political climate cannot change, or that the good economic news is too late.\u201cEarly is better than later. Anytime is better than never,\u201d said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster for congressional leaders and some candidates. \u201cDespite what some say, it\u2019s pretty clear that economic perceptions are never \u2018set\u2019 \u2014 they change from month to month.\u201cAn improving economy is a twofer,\u201d he added. \u201cIt raises the president\u2019s approval ratings, altering the environment in ways that help us, and directly improves the prospects of each Democratic candidate.\u201dThe economy does have to keep improving, however. And in past years it has given rise to false hopes almost annually.After saying in an interview that the jobs number would help Democrats retain their Senate majority, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Senate Democratic leader, added: \u201cBut if it goes back down in the next two months, today\u2019s number won\u2019t mean much. It has to be a continued trend, which it has been.\u201dWhile there are doubters among economic analysts, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said, \u201cAll the signs are pointing toward strong payroll growth\u201d in coming months. He cited the pace of declining layoffs and vitality among small businesses that create most jobs.\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly very difficult for the naysayers to argue that it\u2019s not very good out there,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. He predicted that by November, the unemployment rate would be below 6 percent.Even with continued growth, however, Democrats have a handicap in talking about the economy \u2014 as their reactions to the June report showed \u2014 that reflects both the lingering effects of the recession and the trends that predated it. They cannot dwell on good news without sympathizing with the still-high numbers of long-term unemployed Americans and the millions of workers earning stagnant wages, lest the party seem out of touch.Nonetheless, the Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, who works with Mr. McInturff, the Republican, on polls for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, predicted \u201cthe economy may produce a positive wild card\u201d for Democrats.He also took issue with Mr. McInturff\u2019s contention that the year\u2019s political dynamic is \u201cset.\u201d While Democrats suffer from the fact that Senate battles are mostly in conservative states that Mr. Obama twice lost, Mr. Hart said, \u201cin this era of social media, the old formula \u2014 that anything that happened after July 1 did not count in terms of the economy \u2014 is no longer the case.\u201d Also, Mr. Hart said, President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is not shaping up to be the toxin for Democrats that Republicans were counting on. \u201cIf Democrats can get out of the crouch on the economy, on health care,\u201d he said, \u201cit puts them in a different position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deadlock in Congress Appears to Worsen as Midterms Loom", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongressional MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 With immigration legislation dead for the year, Congress has a very short must-do list as relations between the two parties, already miserable, seem to be getting worse in the buildup to the midterm elections.As a result, minimal expectations for achievement in the final months of the 113th Congress \u2014 and at the midpoint of President Obama\u2019s second term \u2014 are sinking lower, if that is possible.Top Democratic and Republican officials expect that Congress will avert both potential crises, though not without the usual partisan brinkmanship. Republicans do not want to be seen as causing another unpopular government shutdown a month before an election they believe is trending their way, and neither party wants to see workers idled from good-paying jobs on community construction projects.While the House and Senate may find a way to keep road construction going and federal agencies open, what they do beyond that is an open question. Legislation on veterans\u2019 health care, human trafficking and terrorism insurance are on a scaled-back set of achievable priorities, along with an administration request for more border funding.But the collapse of immigration legislation has left a very big hole.With any thought of a grand fiscal bargain in the distant past, the possibility of compromise on a sweeping immigration policy was the last, best hope for a big accomplishment this year \u2014 a potentially legacy-burnishing success for both Mr. Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner.A visibly frustrated president on Monday disclosed that Mr. Boehner, who was at the White House last week to recognize professional golfers, had said definitively that he would not put any immigration legislation on the floor. That disappointed advocates who had held out hope that House Republicans might be willing to act after the threat of primary challenges had diminished. The immigration stalemate set off an unusually harsh exchange of words, with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, saying Mr. Boehner\u2019s \u201cfailure of leadership is enormous.\u201d Mr. Boehner, for his part, said the president was guilty of \u201cgiving false hope to children and their families that if they enter the country illegally, they will be allowed to stay.\u201dMr. Obama, in some of his sharpest comments about congressional Republicans, said they could head off the type of executive action they abhor by cooperating on an immigration approach with broad support.\u201cI take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in this situation, the failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, it\u2019s bad for our economy and it\u2019s bad for our future.\u201d Midterm elections and deep partisanship have not always been obstacles to legislative progress, with members of Congress mindful of the need to score a few legislative victories so they can have something to trumpet to voters back home. For example, as Republicans tried in 2006 to maintain their majorities \u2014 unsuccessfully, as it turned out \u2014 they produced a last-minute string of security-related bills on border fencing and port safeguards after enacting a highway bill and an energy measure. However, a major push on immigration legislation came up short that year as well.Given the dearth of legislation, the best chance for lawmakers to influence policy was probably through the 12 appropriations bills Congress struggled to pass in recent years. The effort was getting a strong push this year, with the House making steady progress. But the drive was derailed in the Senate by a fight over amendments and the threshold for approving them.Though Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland and chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, wants to move forward, it appears unlikely that Mr. Reid will accept a demand by Senate Republicans for a host of amendment votes. This puts the spending bills in limbo and Congress on track to once again approve a stopgap funding bill, at least until after the elections.As for the Highway Trust Fund, top officials say Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has been working on a series of tax changes to provide money into next year, and Senate Democratic leaders have shown some interest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Seeks Quick Approval for Russian Sanctions", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union accelerated its efforts on Friday to enact a tougher sanctions policy against Russia, including considering steps that would hit broad sectors of the Russian economy.Discussions among the union\u2019s ambassadors have been going on for two days on how expansive to make the list. While the sanctions are expected to cover the energy, financial and military sectors, they are also likely to be carefully drawn up so that they penalize only some companies and goods within those sectors.Gaining consensus on the kinds of sanctions that will be felt by the Russians has been an uphill battle in Europe, where countries including France, Britain and Germany have been wary of damaging their own business interests.Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, urged European Union leaders to streamline the approvals process so that beefed-up sanctions could go into effect next week.The package of measures \u201cshould have a strong impact on Russia\u2019s economy while keeping a moderate effect on E.U. economies,\u201d he wrote.A legal text setting out the economic sanctions would be finalized on Friday and should be agreed on as soon as Tuesday, Mr. Van Rompuy wrote. \u201cI would like to ask you that you instruct your ambassador in order to complete an agreement by this date,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Van Rompuy hinted at the difficulties in his letter on Friday, though he said ambassadors meeting in Brussels were able to reach \u201can emerging consensus on some key principles.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Making women \u201cshine\u201d in the economy is an important part of Mr. Abe\u2019s growth policy. What is unclear is whether greater gender equality in management positions will actually lead to higher female participation in the work force, which Japan needs to spur economic growth. That is just what happened in America in the last few decades of the 20th century, when working women began bringing home second paychecks to compensate for the flattening out of men\u2019s wages, thus maintaining and even increasing consumption.Mr. Abe\u2019s main task, it would seem, is persuading more women to join the work force in the first place.

{"Headline": "At 12, Puberty and a Growth Spurt", "Date": "2014-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel9 PhotosWelcoming the reborn Mini in 2002, Americans couldn\u2019t wait to pinch its adorable cheeks. \u201cLook how tiny!\u201d they cooed, plunking down cash and taking their baby home. The Mini isn\u2019t new and novel anymore, not with cumulative sales of more than 550,000. And while the third-generation 2014 Hardtop is still cute, it looks a bit chubbier. The British-built, BMW-designed coupe has expanded to manage people and cargo better. The new Mini is markedly more deluxe, powerful and fuel-efficient. It seems we all have to grow up sometime. The maturation process will continue late this year, when a new Hardtop 4 Door (6.3 inches longer than the Hardtop coupe) reaches showrooms. That 2015 model seems a shrewd expansion of the lineup, perfect for people \u2014 including parents with actual babies \u2014 who\u2019ve wanted a Mini but found it too cramped. The Hardtop 4 Door will be substantially smaller than the chunky Mini Countryman. That all-wheel drive crossover, along with the convertible and other variants, have not yet been updated with the new chassis and powertrains. And the three-door Clubman bids adieu.\u00a0The Mini helped to convince Americans that a small car could be worth relatively big money, and BMW\u2019s designer fingerprints are all over the latest model. The new Mini\u2019s front-drive chassis will underpin BMW-branded cars, including the 2 Series Active Tourer plug-in hybrid that will arrive next year. The Mini adopts turbocharged BMW engines for the first time, in a car that previously relied on Chrysler and then Peugeot Citro\u00ebn power plants. For the base Cooper and its 134-horsepower, 1.5-liter 3-cylinder, the jump from a 121-horsepower 1.6-liter 4 doesn\u2019t sound like much on paper.Fortunately, no one drives on paper. At $20,745 to start, the base Cooper is still the money-saving fuel miser, yet it gains real enthusiast appeal. With 170 pound-feet of torque, 56 more than its anemic predecessor, the Cooper slices nearly two seconds from a 0-to-60 m.p.h. run, at 7.3 seconds with a 6-speed automatic transmission. And this humble 3-cylinder is a social climber: In hopped-up form, it powers the rear wheels of the futuristic $136,000 BMW i8 plug-in hybrid. Appetites for more power are served with the Cooper S ($24,395), whose 2-liter TwinPower turbo 4 supplies 189 horsepower and 207 pound-feet. It\u2019s a sweetheart of an engine, bigger, smoother and more flexible than its 1.6-liter predecessor. The motor seems so BMW-engineered that it might as well rev in German. The Cooper S reaches 60 m.p.h. from a stop in a scant 6.4 seconds, or 6.5 with the standard 6-speed manual.The Mini Hardtop motivated by these power plants has grown 4.8 inches longer, on a 1.1-inch longer wheelbase. The axles are wider front and rear. The once-pert hood rises higher, making it more difficult in tight spaces to tell where the front corners end. The hood bulge is partly necessitated by pedestrian and crash standards. But small-car fans needn\u2019t fret, for this Anglophile charmer is still nearly a foot shorter than a Honda Fit or Ford Fiesta.The new Hardtop has more striking taillamps and headlamps (including optional front LEDs); familiar two-tone treatments with a black or white roof; and a panoply of handsome paints, including the Volcanic Orange on a Cooper S that I tested. In the last Mini Hardtop, putting adults in the rear seat was a theoretical exercise. There\u2019s now 2.9 inches of added legroom and 3.1 inches of extra shoulder space. Under the hatch is 8.9 cubic feet of cargo space, a gain of nearly 50 percent. Total storage with the rear seat folded grows by 58 percent, to 38 cubic feet. Curb weight doesn\u2019t suffer much, with a gain of 60 to 92 pounds. The heaviest Cooper S automatic weighs in at 2,795 pounds, which would have shocked owners of the original, truly miniature Mini of the 1960s, which weighed as little as 1,360 pounds. When the owner of a 2010 Mini buttonholed me in Red Hook, Brooklyn, we temporarily switched cars. And I was taken aback by how his interior \u2014 once praised and awarded for its cheeky design \u2014 now seemed dated and plasticky.In striking comparison, the new model dials back the carnival-ride elements to highlight near-luxury materials and a more harmonious approach. A cool hidden storage panel swivels out above the glovebox. Aircraft-style toggle switches still protrude from a center panel, but several longtime annoyances are banished. Window switches have moved from the dashboard to the doors. Climate controls are simple knobs, not goofy plastic rockers. The speedometer, once awkwardly hung in the middle of the dash, now perches on the steering column, facing the pilot. The center dashboard ring is still big enough to accessorize Flavor Flav, but it now displays vehicle functions through a small standard screen or a lavish optional 8.8-inch affair with a rotary BMW-style control knob. The displays are impressive, the functionality acceptable.The central display comes with a ring of adjustable mood lighting that can supplement multiple driving functions: It displays engine revs, audio and climate levels; counts down distance to turns in navigation mode or indicates parking-distance warnings. Hold its button for about 10 seconds, and it will continuously cycle through its 12 colors, disco-ball style. Unsurprisingly, some traditionalists have fumed at this remaining bit of whimsy, but it\u2019s not really so annoying. Drivers can dim the mood ring or shut it down entirely. It\u2019s still easy to focus on fun in the Mini, whose go-kart spirit is undimmed by newfound practicality. The thick-rimmed steering wheel is lovely, the driving position naturally upright. The sport seats are firm and well-bolstered, including a thigh extension.I spent a week in each of two Cooper S\u2019s, one with a 6-speed automatic (and the S\u2019s more-aggressive, $1,500 Sport transmission with paddle shifters), and one with a 6-speed manual. I\u2019m cringing as I write this, but I prefer the automatic. The manual shifter offers nifty rev-matching on downshifts, but it\u2019s still loosey-goosey, leading to the odd blown shift. The discreet automatic made short work of snarled Manhattan traffic and paddled through gears with dependable precision on spirited drives.A Drive Selector switch controls settings for throttle, automatic gearbox, engine sound (via synthetic frequencies through the audio speakers) and the optional adjustable Bilstein shocks. Some writers have praised the car\u2019s ride quality, but I couldn\u2019t say: My Minis wore the largest, lowest-profile 18-inch wheels and tires, a poor match for New York\u2019s cratered streets. Residents of urban minefields may prefer the available 16- or 17-inch wheels (15s are standard on the base Cooper) that put more rubber between you and the road.Escaping New York, the Cooper S felt faster, with better body control. It was cheetah-quick to change direction, with less jiggle over rippled pavement. Driven to the ragged edge, the short-wheelbase body begins to bobble. But it takes an angry approach to upset this happy car. The zesty performance comes with better economy. The S automatic is rated 27 miles per gallon in town, a gain of 1 m.p.g., and 38 on the highway, a leap of 4 m.p.g. (The E.P.A. pegs the manual S at 27/35.) The manual Cooper leads the way at 30/42 m.p.g., or 29/40 with the automatic.The Mini can seem expensive on a square-foot basis. But the all-new design delivers a lot for the money. Standard features include an engine stop-start system, the drive mode selector, keyless locking, push-button start and eight air bags, including a pair of knee bags up front. The Mini\u2019s seemingly limitless options demand self-discipline if you want to keep the monthly payment in check. Extras include a head-up display, panoramic moonroof, rear backup camera, even a self-parking system. My decked-out Minis reached a respective $33,795 and $37,395. At those prices, I might divert my attention to the roomier, even-better-performing Volkswagen GTI or Subaru WRX. But beneath its familiar skin, the new Mini is now a BMW to its core. Good luck finding a Bimmer that starts at barely $20,000 \u2014 or that, sensibly equipped, stays below $30,000. If you just tell yourself that this British coupe is really a baby BMW, the Mini may come off as a fair deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "17 Companies File Casino Plans With New York State in Push for 4 Gambling Licenses", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeventeen companies on Monday unveiled lavish and increasingly expensive proposals for New York casino-resorts in communities from Albany to Tuxedo Park and Binghamton, officially starting the competition for four state-issued gambling licenses.With promises of luxury hotels, conference centers, adventure parks and thousands of jobs, as well as slot machines and poker tables, several of the proposals in the region closest to New York City top $1 billion. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has sought to expand gambling with the hope of reviving upstate economies, creating new jobs and generating tax revenues. It remains to be seen whether the casinos can deliver on all their promises. While the number of gambling operations has been swelling in New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, casino revenues are sliding in New Jersey and Connecticut.But that has not kept developers and gambling operators from spending millions on proposals for New York, where there are already five Indian casinos and nine racetracks with electronic slot machines and table games.The state plans to select the winners sometime in the fall for three separate regions: the capital region around Albany, the Catskill and Hudson Valley areas, and an area in the central part of the state that stretches from Binghamton north to Lake Ontario.The heavily detailed applications were due on Monday, at the State Gaming Commission office in Schenectady.Just to be sure, Empire Resorts sent armed guards to escort a tractor-trailer loaded with its 280 cartons outlining their proposal at a site near Monticello on Sunday night. It also sent a backup truck in case anything went wrong. The driver waited for hours in the commission\u2019s parking lot until the office opened at 8 a.m.But Tom and Jim Wilmot, developers based in Rochester, were first, having delivered their applications for a $425 million casino-resort in the Finger Lakes region on Friday. The sharpest competition is in the Catskill-Hudson Valley region close to New York City, where eight developer-operators are vying for what they hope will be two casino licenses.Next door, Louis Cappelli, a developer, and the Mohegan Tribal Authority are proposing a $550 million casino-resort, which, like Empire Resorts\u2019s project, would lie on the grounds of the former Concord resort.In nearby Ellenville, in Ulster County, Claremont Partners is planning a $582 million resort, with nightclubs, restaurants and an 18-hole golf course, on the grounds of the former Nevele resort.But these proposals have been overshadowed by the recent emergence of six rival proposals in Orange County, which is even closer to Manhattan and its rich storehouse of tourists.Cordish Companies and Penn National Gaming are proposing a $750 million Live! Hotel and Casino in South Blooming Grove with all the usual features. The proposal includes what the proponents call an \u201cAngel incubator,\u201d a nonprofit organization designed to attract manufacturing, computer science and research businesses from out of state. Genting, the giant Malaysian gambling and entertainment company, submitted two separate casino proposals for Tuxedo and Montgomery. Genting owns a slot parlor at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, and is related to Empire Resorts.Saratoga Harness Racing and Rush Street Gaming proposed a $670 million project on 70 acres in Newburgh.There are five other developers seeking to build a casino resort in the capital region, including one by the Galesi Group and Rush Street Gaming on the Mohawk River in Schenectady and a $300 million casino proposal at Howe Caverns.

Sales Rise as Buyers Ignore Recalls", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has been a mystery in the auto industry in recent months: How can General Motors, embroiled in a safety crisis that has led to the recall of about 29 million vehicles worldwide this year, continue to have such strong sales?On Tuesday, G.M. again defied the negative publicity, announcing that its sales in June rose by 1 percent over the same month a year earlier, to 267,461 vehicles sold, and keeping pace with an overall strong industry performance.For G.M., it was a dose of welcome news, coming a day after another wide-ranging round of recalls \u2014 8.4 million vehicles worldwide \u2014 and the announcement of a victims fund for those affected by a defective ignition switch that the automaker has linked to 13 deaths and 54 crashes.Over all, automakers in June had their strongest monthly sales since before the recession, with the industry selling 1.4 million vehicles last month. That translates to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.98 million, compared with 15.88 million last year. That is the highest reported rate since July 2006. Chrysler led the way, increasing by 9 percent, on the strength of Jeep sales, while Ford struggled, dropping by 6 percent.Analysts cited several reasons for G.M.\u2019s performance, like a stronger economy, demand after the bad winter, and the recalls themselves \u2014 which drew people into dealerships.\u201cEarly in the year, the harsh winter dampened sales, but pre-existing pent-up demand only strengthened during this time and since the country warmed back up, car shoppers have been out in full force,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst for Edmunds. Low interest rates and the proliferation of leasing, she added, have also enticed buyers to buy new cars.Ms. Caldwell said there had been a disconnect between what people saw with the recalls of older G.M. cars like the Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion \u2014 which have been out of production for years \u2014 and how they acted when they were ready to make a new purchase.\u201cYou\u2019d think it would damage their brand,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually helping to drive purchases at the dealership. You come in to have your old car fixed and see the new designs and technology, and wind up thinking \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll buy a new car.\u2019\u00a0\u201dLower-cost financing offers and other incentives are helping push the trend, Ms. Caldwell said. G.M. is also quietly offering additional discounts to owners of the 2.6 million vehicles recalled as part of the original ignition switch problem. The automaker has authorized dealers to offer employee prices to owners who inquire about a new purchase. But sometimes there is no substitute for simply getting people in the door.\u201cA good dealer will tell you they just need to get a customer into the dealership, and they\u2019ll do the rest,\u201d she said. Edmunds recently conducted a study of Cobalt models involved in the recall, and found that not only are a higher percentage of Cobalts being traded in, but that a higher rate of Cobalt owners are choosing to purchase another G.M. vehicle.\u201cWe\u2019re getting a good percentage of people in our lounge waiting for their cars to be fixed, and it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve thought about buying a new car, but it\u2019s time,\u201d said Tim McMahon, general sales manager at Ganley Chevrolet in Brook Park, Ohio, near Cleveland.Mr. McMahon pointed to refreshed models and economic incentives: \u201cThese new cars are nothing like the 2007s, 2008s, 2009s,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIncentives are outstanding \u2014 particularly for the Cruze, Malibu and Equinox. They have outstanding leases on them.\u201d\u201cThis is a catalyst,\u201d he said of the recalls. \u201cIt brought them to the dealership. It\u2019s an unexpected benefit, but I think it\u2019s helped. A lot of those turned into sales.\u201dAkshay Anand, analyst for Kelley Blue Book\u2019s KBB.com, said G.M. was able to capitalize on buyers now because it was benefiting from an aggressive rollout of new and refreshed products, especially in trucks and sport utility vehicles. \u201cThese kinds of trucks and sport utilities are a little pricier, but the economy is getting better now, so they\u2019re benefiting,\u201d he said.Buick reported its best June sales since 2006, rising 18 percent compared with June 2013, driven by its Encore sport utility vehicle, which rose 82 percent over the previous June, and two sedans, the LaCrosse, up 33 percent, and Regal, which rose 26 percent.Chevrolet\u2019s sales dipped 3 percent, while Cadillac was essentially flat and the GMC truck brand gained 11 percent in June compared with last year.While G.M. kept pace with the industry, Ford struggled, with sales falling to 221,396, a 6 percent drop over the same month a year ago.Erich Merkle, chief United States sales analyst at Ford, said in a conference call that the company\u2019s June performance was partly because of lower incentives offered last month compared with competitors.Average incentives across the industry were down about $50 in June compared with May, while Ford\u2019s average incentives dropped $130, the company said.Merkle also cited Ford\u2019s attempts to balance inventory of F-series trucks in anticipation of the new aluminum-body F-150 coming out this year as a reason for the June sales drop.The Chrysler Group had a 9 percent gain in June, its 51st consecutive monthly sales gain. Those sales were also driven entirely by the company\u2019s trucks and sport utility vehicles. The automaker\u2019s truck sales soared by 22 percent in June, while its cars dropped by 19 percent. The Jeep brand\u2019s sales, for example, rose to 57,006, a 28 percent increase. Among other automakers, Nissan reported sales gains of 5 percent in June, while Toyota said it had overall gains of 3 percent for the month. Hyundai reported a 4 percent gain.Rebecca R.

{"Headline": "Back From the Brink in Afghanistan", "Date": "2014-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialEven so, there is no guarantee that the compromise, reached Friday and Saturday after Mr. Kerry made an urgent trip to Kabul, will endure. This is, after all, Afghanistan, a fragile, war-ravaged country with many ethnic, geographic and political divisions. First, that means upholding their commitment to a recount, by international monitors, of all 8.1 million votes cast in the June 14 balloting, however challenging that task is. Preliminary results last week showed Mr. Ghani leading Mr. Abdullah with 56.4 percent of the vote. Mr. Abdullah cried foul, and even some neutral observers found Mr. Ghani\u2019s margin of victory less than credible. The candidates have also agreed that the results will be binding and that the winner will lead a national unity government. The recount, is expected to begin in the next few days and take several weeks, and could delay the planned Aug. 2 inauguration of the new president. But it is the only way to give legitimacy to the electoral process. The compromise is a rare success for American foreign policy. But it would not have been possible without President Obama\u2019s threat to withhold aid, the billions of dollars that have propped up Afghanistan\u2019s economy and underwritten its security forces, and without which it could well go the way of Iraq. Mr. Obama must be prepared, if necessary, to use that leverage again to ensure the deal is carried out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kerry Assures China That the U.S. Can Have Many Allies in Asia", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Seeking to put the best face on a difficult relationship with Beijing, Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the United States and China could find ways to manage their differences and had more in common than not.Neither side wanted to fall into the \u201ctrap of zero sum competition,\u201d Mr. Kerry said at the conclusion of an annual strategic and economic dialogue between top officials of the two countries.The array of topics with some areas of agreement \u2014 climate change, Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan \u2014 attested to the viability of the relationship, he said.Still, Mr. Kerry used fairly blunt language in an effort to persuade President Xi Jinping that the United States did not intend its 60-year system of alliances in Asia to encircle and contain China.\u201cWe mean what we say when we emphasize that there\u2019s no U.S. strategy to try to push back against or be in conflict with China,\u201d he said, as Mr. Xi sat beside him during a farewell session at the Great Hall of the People.Mr. Kerry was indirectly replying to charges by Chinese officials that President Obama had reinvigorated America\u2019s network of alliances in Asia with the idea of containing China and its fast modernizing military. In response, Mr. Xi has initiated a campaign that calls for a new security architecture of Asia for the Asians.New accusations that Chinese hackers had attacked highly sensitive American material were brusquely dismissed by China, even as the American delegation, headed by Mr. Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, tried to press cyberespionage as an important issue at the conference.The Foreign Ministry dismissed assertions in an article in The New York Times that Chinese hackers had infiltrated United States government computer systems that house personal information of federal employees.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the article was part of what he called an irresponsible anti-China smear campaign.\u201cThis is what we say and what we have been doing,\u201d he said. \u201cRecently, some American media and Internet security firms keep playing the card of China Internet Threat and smear China\u2019s image. They cannot produce tenable evidence. Such reports and comments are irresponsible and are not worth refuting.\u201dAsked about the article at a closing news conference, Mr. Kerry said that he and Mr. Lew had been unaware of the attack described in the article and did not raise it with Chinese officials, although the broader subject of cybersecurity was discussed.\u201cWe were notified about this alleged incident minutes before coming out here,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.He said the article was about attempted \u201cintrusions\u201d that were still being investigated and it did not appear that sensitive material had been compromised.A senior American official who participated in sessions with the Chinese on Thursday said the case of the hacking into the Office of Personnel Management was not raised by either side. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk about a delicate matter.The Chinese, angered by the indictment by the Justice Department in May of five members of the People\u2019s Liberation Army on charges of cyberespionage, refused a request at the dialogue by the Americans to restart a joint cyber working group.China suspended the work of the group that brought together American and Chinese negotiators to discuss cyber issues and has complained that National Security Agency documents made public by Edward J. Snowden showed the United States had used cyberespionage to gain economic advantage.Mr. Xi, who invited the American and Chinese delegations to meet him Thursday afternoon at a session that was partly open to reporters, called on the two countries to work on building a \u201cnew model of major country relationship,\u201d a phrase he frequently uses to imply an equal status between the United States and China.It is an expression that the Obama administration has been reluctant to endorse for fear that it would confer legitimacy to China\u2019s various territorial claims, including in the East China Sea and South China Sea.The Obama administration sent senior officials to the dialogue, including Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve; Michael Froman, the United States trade representative; Ernest Moniz, secretary of energy; Penny Pritzker, secretary of commerce, and John D. Podesta, counselor to President Obama, who specializes in climate change.The Americans appeared pleased about what they called serious discussions on how to reduce carbon emissions. The presence of Mr. Podesta, who the Chinese know is close to Mr. Obama and is committed to climate change policies, added weight, they said.A joint working group on climate change announced that both countries would develop new greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards.\u201cThis effort has to be mutual and has to be accompanied by commitments which are defined by the actions we will actually take,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about one country making a demand of the other.\u201dEven so, China\u2019s chief climate official, Xie Zhenhua, said China, which still considers itself a developing country, should not be subject to the same rules for greenhouse gas emissions as the United States, suggesting that Beijing will oppose attempts to impose them at next year\u2019s world climate conference in Paris.Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Still Walking on Air, Germans Touch Down for World Cup Party", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe are all world champions,\u201d Coach Joachim L\u00f6w shouted into a microphone as he stood in front of the crowd, which stretched at least half a mile from the stage at Brandenburg Gate, a symbol of reunited Germany.The first glimpse that fans caught of the national team was of its plane, a Boeing 747 operated by the German airline Lufthansa that was newly christened Siegerflieger (\u201cthe victors\u2019 plane\u201d) Fanhansa. The aircraft was given special permission to sweep low over the so-called fan mile.Minutes later, it landed at Tegel Airport, 90 minutes behind schedule after a collision with a luggage cart delayed its departure by two hours in Rio de Janeiro Monday night. Also not part of the plan, it seemed, was the steady stream of humanity that swelled on sidewalks and in the street as the team\u2019s open-topped double-decker bus approached the celebration.The crowd slowed the team\u2019s vehicle to a walking pace as thousands filmed the occasion and hurled T-shirts to the team members. Obliging players found markers to sign them and toss them back.Even American diplomats and employees of the United States embassy joined the party, either from their doorstep near Brandenburg Gate or clustered on the embassy\u2019s terrace looking down on the fans. A banner on the embassy proclaimed America\u2019s congratulations to the German team.\u201cI just don\u2019t know what besides this world championship could spark the \u2018we\u2019 feeling in this country,\u201d said Wolfgang Niersbach, the president of the German Football Association. \u201cThat we gave so many people joy is worth more than our own happiness. It was madness, and it is just madness.\u201dTens of millions watched a live broadcast that lasted more than four hours. Most of them had a better view than those at the fan mile, several of whom arrived as early as 4 a.m.Tobias J\u00e4ger, 45, a caterer in Berlin, had his young son on his shoulders. \u201cI am here because I am insane like everyone else here,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping to catch a good view \u2014 but that is very unrealistic.\u201dGudrun Neubauer, a 66-year-old pensioner from Hamburg, was happy for the experience but \u201cdefinitely disappointed by the organization of this event.\u201d She had first tried an entrance closer to the action but was turned away, she said.Sister Martina, a 46-year-old nun from a convent in Bad Saulgau in southwest Germany, wore her gray habit and four stars \u2014 one for each of Germany\u2019s world championships \u2014 on her forehead. \u201cI just want to applaud our team,\u201d Sister Martina said. \u201cThey played like giant \u2014 absolutely fantastic.\u201dThe country followed the fate of its team as never before, with a record 86 percent tuning in to the World Cup final Sunday. (Germany beat Argentina, 1-0, with a goal from Mario G\u00f6tze, the second youngest member of the team, in the 113th minute.)The four World Cup championship years \u2014 1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014 \u2014 were emblazoned on the side of the team\u2019s bus, and each of the first three wins also carried some political significance. In 1954, West Germany\u2019s championship was seen as a sign that the country was back on its feet, nine years after the defeat of the Nazis. The win in 1974 symbolized the surety of West Germany\u2019s economic miracle, while the 1990 title \u2014 also over Argentina \u2014 came midway between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of Germany in October 1990.That was before G\u00f6tze was born and before German soccer slumped to an unusual low. About a decade ago, just as its government took tough measures to reinvigorate the economy, the country\u2019s soccer elite did the same with its national team, reaching out to build a younger, tougher, more diverse but also more collective-minded squad.Both Germany and Argentina had solid chances throughout the game, but Germany finally scored in the 113th minute, lifting the country to its fourth World Cup title.The players showed off that team spirit on Tuesday. Taking the stage in the four groups that roomed together in houses at the team\u2019s headquarters in Brazil, they clowned, crowed and celebrated the Cup.Defender J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, who has a German mother and Ghanaian father, paid perhaps the best tribute to his vibrant hometown. \u201cHello, Berlin!\u201d he said. \u201cI am so proud to be a Berliner.\u201dStriker Thomas M\u00fcller, known as a garrulous jokester, and his housemates, including the team captain, Philipp Lahm, roused the crowd to a fan samba, with M\u00fcller playing air guitar. The group had walked in with the golden World Cup trophy well hidden behind their backs, revealing it when they collapsed on the ground and left Lahm holding it high.Bastian Schweinsteiger, who sustained a cut under his right eye in Sunday\u2019s final, still sported a bandage on the spot. Wrapped most of the time in a black, red and gold national flag, he summed up his view of Germany\u2019s soccer trek.\u201cWe were here in 2006,\u201d he recalled, when the country hosted the championships, giving a great party but finishing third. \u201cNow,\u201d he yelled, \u201cwe\u2019ve got the damned thing at last!\u201dKatarina Johannsen and Victor Homola contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The government said that the economy grew at a robust 4 percent annual rate this spring. Later, the Federal Reserve, as expected, scaled back its support for the economy, while pledging to keep short-term interest rates low \u201cfor a considerable time.\u201dTraders sold government bonds, pushing up the yield on the two-year Treasury note to 0.56 percent, the highest level this year, from 0.54 percent late Tuesday.

{"Headline": "A Challenge From the BRICS", "Date": "2014-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOn July 15, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2014 the BRICS group of nations \u2014 announced the creation of the New Development Bank aimed at challenging the American-led global economic order. The United States and Europe should take note that these nations are determined not to be constrained by Western institutions that fail to accommodate their ambitions. The frustrations of this five-nation bloc are understandable, if somewhat divergent. Brazil and India blame the West\u2019s 2008 financial crisis for sapping economic growth. South Africa and India need capital for infrastructure development, preferably without conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund or World Bank. China, whose economy is expected to surpass that of the United States as the world\u2019s biggest sometime soon, doesn\u2019t see why its currency shouldn\u2019t replace the American dollar in a good portion of global transactions. Russia, ousted from the Group of 8 and facing Western economic sanctions following its annexation of Crimea and support for rebels in Ukraine, is working to build closer relationships with China and the rest of its fellow BRICS. The BRICS contain 40 percent of the world\u2019s population and account for 20 percent of global economic output, yet only Europeans and Americans have led the I.M.F. or the World Bank. The United States Congress has contributed to frustration by refusing to pass legislation to shift voting power more fairly among I.M.F. member states \u2014 even though this would cost the United States nothing.China represents 70 percent of the collective gross national product of the BRICS. A China Development Bank already exists, and China is creating its own Asian Development Bank. The New Development Bank will be based in Shanghai. India will assume the presidency of the bank for the first six years, followed by rotating terms for Brazil and Russia, but how this will counterbalance China\u2019s economic clout is far from clear. The bank will begin with an initial capital of $50 billion, rising to $100 billion, with a separate $100 billion Contingent Reserve Arrangement. The BRICS plan to bring in other developing countries in Africa and Asia, and they are talking about creating a regional-security alternative to NATO. The BRICS nations have quite different political systems. Russia and China, for instance, are authoritarian regimes; India and Brazil are democracies. Some of them may be more willing than others to observe international norms on, say, human rights, and some may be more inclined to condition investments on environmental protection. It will be interesting to see how these differences play out in the bank\u2019s governance and operations. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Moves to Ease Home-Registration Rules in Urbanization Push", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Chinese government issued proposals on Wednesday to break down barriers that a nationwide household registration system has long imposed between rural and urban residents and among regions, reinforcing inequality, breeding discontent and hampering economic growth.Yet even as officials promoted easier urbanization and the goal of permanently settling an additional 100 million rural people in towns and cities by 2020, they said changes to the system \u2014 which links many government entitlements to a person\u2019s official residence, even if that person has long since moved away \u2014 must be gradual and must protect big cities like Beijing.But Mr. Huang later added a caveat that displayed the caution accompanying the promises of change. \u201cAt the same time, however, specific policies have to be tailored to the practical circumstances of each city,\u201d he said.The barriers in China\u2019s system of household registration, or hukou, date to Mao\u2019s era. In the late 1950s, the system was instituted to keep famished peasants from pouring into cities. The policies later calcified into caste-like barriers that still often tie citizens\u2019 education, welfare and housing opportunities to their official residence, even if they have moved far away from that place to find a livelihood. The restrictions hinder permanent migration among many urban and rural areas and among regions and cities, such as Shanghai and Beijing.The divisions have become a source of discontent, and sometimes protests \u2014 when, for example, children from the countryside or from another city cannot enroll in a local school or take the university entrance exam where they live.At a meeting on Wednesday of the State Council Standing Committee \u2014 China\u2019s equivalent of a government cabinet \u2014 Mr. Li said rural migrants with steady jobs in cities \u201cmust steadily become absorbed into cities as new urbanites, enjoying the same basic public services and equal rights,\u201d Xinhua, the state news agency, reported.\u201cThey must not be regarded as urban second-class citizens,\u201d he said.The government document released on Wednesday brought together commitments, some already announced, to steadily and selectively lift some of these barriers. Some cities have already made such changes, including formally erasing the division between urban and rural registration for local residents. But experts have said such changes do not mean much unless welfare, housing and other policies are also changed to overcome persistent inequalities.In small cities with urban populations of up to one million, people with steady jobs and housing who meet requirements for welfare payments will be allowed to register as local residents. Similar rules will apply to larger cities, with stricter limits.But the proposals say that for the biggest cities, with urban populations of five million or more, the number of newcomers must be stringently controlled, and a points system will be used to ration household registration opportunities.The government also said, as it had before, that it would try to ease barriers that deny places in schools, health care, and family-planning and other public services to residents who do not have local household registration papers. Many city governments have resisted such changes, and urban residents fear the erosion of their privileges.\u201cA major reason why people want household registration in a city is for their children\u2019s education,\u201d said Professor Lu of Renmin University. \u201cThe value in a hukou is mostly in education and health care resources, and cities want to limit who gets those resources.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Months After Washington Landslide, Hopeful Steps Forward", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo the Millers came back after the disaster, and they were playing a free concert for exhausted emergency responders at the downtown command center a few miles from the slide when a friend came over and whispered that a call had come in: Their house, far from the slide, had caught fire.That could be Darrington\u2019s motto. Through the landslide, the response and the aftermath \u2014 especially the three months when Darrington was cut off from its southern access route, Highway 530, by millions of tons of debris \u2014 questions about the future hung like the point of a knife. Would the summer tourism season, crucial to carrying the region through the lean winter months, fall short and take this isolated town of 1,400 people down with it? Would visitors be scared away by reports of devastation?So far, town leaders, residents and business owners say, the news is encouraging.The 38th annual Bluegrass Festival, where the Millers will perform Friday and Sunday on a roster of local and national bands, is the barometer of the moment. Advance ticket sales for the three-day event, which typically draws 9,000 to 10,000 people to an outdoor stage at the foot of Whitehorse Mountain, were down about 15 percent earlier this month, but a late surge brought them back to last year\u2019s levels. The all-important day-tripper traffic from Seattle, 75 miles southwest, cannot be predicted.Other economic indicators have improved, too. A ripple of real-estate transactions has swept through town in the last few months, with homes and commercial properties \u2014 some of them long boarded up \u2014 changing hands. This has prompted hopes that new residents or entrepreneurs have discovered the area\u2019s charms, though some worry that speculators or absentee landlords are just buying at the bottom.The Darrington Timberbowl Rodeo, canceled last year because the ramshackle bleachers were deemed unsafe, was reborn thanks to $25,000 in state money for repairs, and it drew a packed house.Ernestine Jones, 82, a volunteer at the Bluegrass Festival who has fielded calls from around the country, said some prospective visitors had told her they were worried about the slide or fearful that another might happen. But others said they were coming with a purpose, specifically wanting to help.\u201cOne gentleman said, \u2018I intend to come and drop some cash in your little town,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Ms. Jones, whose family came to Darrington in the 1940s from North Carolina, mostly as loggers, and helped start the bluegrass scene, playing the hill country music they had known back home.Aerial image showing the area devastated by Saturday\u2019s collapse, as well as structures in the path of the mud.Snohomish County officials, who put together a marketing campaign for the Stillaguamish Valley after the disaster, using $150,000 in state money, said they were keenly aware that drawing people to the area would be a complex task. Hard-nosed marketing practicality, they said, meant acknowledging that the slide itself \u2014 however much an open wound it is to residents who lost friends or family \u2014 might be a draw that could help the area\u2019s economy.\u201cIt will be a tourist attraction,\u201d said Wendy Becker, the cultural and economic development manager for Snohomish County, referring to the slide zone, which will be a construction site through this fall as a new roadbed is built. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to say that term,\u201d Ms. Becker added, but human nature cannot be denied. \u201cCuriosity will make them want to see it,\u201d she said.There was also frustration and anger about the financial dealings that emerged after the slide, when one landowner on an emergency bypass road demanded a huge payment from the state to allow a right of way. Other landowners had agreed to the emergency terms offered by the state and were paid, in many cases, about $500. The one holdout demanded tens of thousands and finally settled on about $85,000, said Darrington\u2019s mayor, Dan Rankin. That enraged residents, Mr. Rankin said, some of whom urged a kind of frontier justice.\u201cThey said, \u2018Publish their names and let the chips fall where they may,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. But there are also stories like Brook Alongi\u2019s. He was a manager at Boeing, living in Darrington and commuting to the company\u2019s aircraft construction complex in Everett, about 50 miles away, while quietly planning one day to open a shop for making and selling custom saddles and other equestrian items. When the slide hit, Mr. Alongi volunteered for weeks in the debris field, helping search for survivors and remains. Two days after returning to work at Boeing, he said, it was suddenly clear what he should do, and he quit.\u201cAfter the slide, everything was in a better perspective,\u201d Mr. Alongi, 37, said. This Monday, he met with the owner of a vacant shop on Darrington\u2019s main drag, aiming to sign a lease for Whitehorse Saddlery.Mr. Rankin said he knew that the commingled mood of grief and change would not last much more than a season. \u201cMy job now is to find a road map for what comes after,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Youth Tsunami in Arab World", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesMr. Cole\u2019s book is at its most illuminating when it takes the reader inside the youth movements in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, showing us how activists used technology and social media to amplify their message and connect with like-minded citizens across the region. Although this phenomenon has already been widely covered by Western media, Mr. Cole chronicles it in fascinating detail here, recounting the stories of prominent dissidents and their often pioneering use of Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and cellphone technology to network and organize. In both Tunisia and Egypt, Mr. Cole observes, the spread of the Internet created \u201cnew virtual social spaces in which activists could meet and interact at a time when physical meetings of more than a few people attracted the attention of the secret police.\u201d Bloggers and Facebook users were able to come together in cyberspace to share information, denounce political repression, celebrate martyrs and call for action. Activists were also able to combine digital strategies with more traditional methods (like pamphleteering and face-to-face exchanges of information in coffee shops and soccer stadiums) to connect with student organizations and labor unions, and to form alliances (however temporary) across the ideological spectrum.The creation of YouTube in 2005 and the growing reach of satellite television (most notably Al Jazeera) also gave dissidents important tools. In 2006, the blogger Wael Abbas began posting graphic videos, taken secretly, of Egyptian police brutalizing their prisoners, which provoked public outrage. And in Tunisia, videos of the police opening fire on young protesters \u2014 who had turned out in the streets after a fruit vendor burned himself to death (in December 2010) in response to being humiliated by government officials \u2014 received thousands of views and fueled the spread of demonstrations across the country.In Egypt (where, according to The C.I.A. World Factbook, 49.9 percent of the population is 24 or younger), disgust with the Mubarak government had been building for years. Among the events that created \u201clinks and networks among a diverse group of leftist and Muslim fundamentalist organizations\u201d opposed to Mr. Mubarak as an agent of the West, Mr. Cole says, were demonstrations in early 2003 against the coming United States invasion of Iraq and the Gaza war of late 2008 and early 2009. Mr. Cole\u2019s conclusion to this book is a hopeful one. He writes: \u201cThe youth revolutionaries of the Middle East inspired their peers throughout the globe by their ideals of liberty and social justice and their collective action techniques. Fundamentalist movements seeking to take advantage of the political opening to impose new forms of theocratic authoritarianism suffered severe setbacks at the hands of the same youth activists.\u201d Also played down in \u201cThe New Arabs\u201d are the post-revolution problems that secular youth movements face in learning how to win elections and actually govern. Mr. Cole acknowledges that \u201cthe youth who made the revolutions were guilty of a certain amount of magical thinking,\u201d writing that \u201cmany activists appear to have believed that the corrupt dictatorships were the major obstacle to economic and social progress, and that sweeping them away would abruptly improve the economy.\u201d THE NEW ARABSHow the Millennial Generation Is Changing the Middle EastBy Juan Cole348 pages.

The conflict aside, the new military-dominated government of Egypt has largely shut the tunnel system that fed the economy (and the rocket-import business, too). In its struggle with the Palestinian Authority, dominated by Fatah, Hamas is running low on cash, so many workers have not been paid, or have been only partly paid, for months now.\u201cRamadan usually brings every good thing,\u201d said Muhammad Ahmad, whose fruit stall was doing little business. So far on Friday afternoon, he\u2019d taken in only 50 shekels, when normally during Ramadan, he said, he would take in 1,000 shekels a day.\u201cThis war in Gaza has caused a kind of fear and stress and tension,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are afraid to go out of their homes.\u201dThe reluctance to spend time in public places is shared now in Israel, too, as the rockets rain down. But Israel is a larger, much more modern polity, which has equipped itself with shelters, air-raid sirens and a missile-defense system.At Gaza\u2019s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, photographers and camera crews waited at the entrance for any ambulance that might roll up with a wounded person. Inside, there were a few men on stretchers, bloody and dotted with shrapnel wounds, and one girl, age 7, who had been severely wounded in an attack on a house in Al-Bureij, in central Gaza. She was brought here as a particularly difficult case, and Dr. Ayman al-Sahbani, the head of the emergency medicine, said she was likely to die.Dr. Sahbani was upset but professional. He and most of his 10 doctors and 10 nurses had been at the hospital for four days without going home, he said. Al-Shifa has treated about half of the more than 600 Palestinians wounded so far, he said, with some pride. It could cope, he said, \u201cif the fighting does not escalate.\u201d\u201cWe have drugs and consumables for three weeks in normal times,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re reduced, but if it gets worse, with a ground invasion, it could be all gone in a day.\u201d Not that he couldn\u2019t use more doctors and specialist surgeons, he said.What bothers him is the number of children he has had to treat, he said. \u201cSo we hope it will stop. I know this is political, but we doctors think only of humanity, and we see kids crying and wounded or dying, and it has a big psychological impact.\u201dLike most Gazans, Dr. Sahbani would not fault Hamas but rather \u201cthe siege and the occupation.\u201d As a Palestinian Authority employee, he lost his salary when he continued to work in Al-Shifa under the Hamas government, which did pay him, though less. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor and this is an emergency room,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could I not work?\u201dBut for the last three months, even he has not been paid.He has not had permission to leave Gaza for three years, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than eight years of siege,\u201d he said, noting shortages \u201cof gasoline, of electricity, of medical supplies and building materials,\u201d let alone the nearly sealed borders. \u201cNow we\u2019re being bombed, and where can we go?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201dIt is a plaint heard regularly here, with particular pathos during hostilities. Gazans see themselves as living in a poor territory that nobody cares about, a kind of \u201cprison,\u201d as they like to say, trapped between Israel, an ambivalent or unfriendly Egypt and the closely patrolled sea. Not even fellow Palestinians in the West Bank really care for them, they say.Of course, they are also prisoners of their situation, both defended and endangered by Hamas and other, more radical Islamic groups, which are devoted to resistance against Israel and thoroughly embedded among the noncombatants of an overcrowded population with no ability to leave.There is understated criticism of the conflict, though mostly directed at Israel. Nawaf al-Najar, 57, shopping with his wife, Nawal, for groceries for their large family, used to be a construction worker in Israel but is now unemployed. He lives off intermittent charity and United Nations food parcels for refugees, and has trouble finding the money for Nawal\u2019s diabetes medicine.After blaming Israel for the war and its \u201cimperial policies,\u201d Mr. Najar turned philosophical, and even slightly subversive. \u201cWar never achieves political goals, but just destroys the people,\u201d he said. \u201cWar is the language of the ignorant, and it is fought by the ignorant.\u201dBut it is not far away. Nearby, on what is known as Intelligence Street, because of the Palestinian Authority intelligence headquarters that once functioned there, young men kicked at broken glass and stared at the remainder of a house struck by an Israeli bombing early Friday. The attack was apparently aimed at the resident of an apartment there, who was killed; the building, which also housed a small grocery store and bakery, was collapsing.Piles of soot-covered plastic bottles of soda were in the rubble, along with blasted packages of Huggies diapers. One man walked by and said simply: \u201cThis was the bakery I used.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germans See World Cup Win as a Symbol of Global Might", "Date": "2014-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Even normally quiet streets were electrified early Monday by Germany\u2019s dramatic 1-0 win of the World Cup in extra time, a victory that symbolized, at least to fans, not just the country\u2019s dominance of Europe, but its global prominence. Car horns and vuvuzelas honked, and fireworks and firecrackers exploded.On the Kurfuerstendamm, the gleaming street of stores and restaurants that was the symbol of West Berlin during the Cold War, cars quickly jammed traffic and fans draped themselves in the black, red and gold of the German flag.\u201cI am the happiest man alive,\u201d said Jacob Vogely, 25, who was just a baby when the Berlin Wall fell and produced similar jams in probably the greatest party this city has ever seen.Sam Sch\u00f6neberg, also 25, called the final a \u201cheart attack,\u201d given the six or seven minutes the whole country seemed to hold its breath after Mario G\u00f6tze scored the decisive goal.Mr. G\u00f6tze had not even been born the last time Germany won the World Cup, in 1990, beating Argentina then, too. Both Germany and Argentina had solid chances throughout the game, but Germany finally scored in the 113th minute, lifting the country to its fourth World Cup title.That victory came to symbolize the unification of Germany; this one, ardent fans said early Monday, will usher in an era of further prosperity for Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get rid of this grin,\u201d said Christoph Nitsche, 29, an industrial mechanic, as he stood outside a tapas bar in Frankfurt that, like almost all restaurants and bars across the country, had set up a large-screen television outside. \u201cNow we\u2019re free.\u201d Asked if the victory had any larger consequences for Germany, Mr. Nitsche took a drag on a cigarette, thought for a moment, and said: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an economic upswing. People are in a good mood.\u201dThat mood was reflected in the evident joy with which the country\u2019s president, Joachim Gauck, and the normally restrained chancellor, Angela Merkel, embraced each player in Rio de Janeiro as they received their victors\u2019 medals.The German victory could easily be seen as emblematic of the country\u2019s economic and political pre-eminence in Europe and its economic comeback of the last decade. In 1990, the nation was embarking on a long, costly odyssey of reunification.In 2002, when the German team finished second, the country was still seen as the sick man of Europe, too set in its ways in a world that demanded innovation. But Germany proved it could change.The rebound of the German economy came after a national overhaul that reduced barriers to hiring and firing and obstacles for entrepreneurs. At the same time, a revitalization of the German youth soccer development program helped produce the team that beat Argentina on Sunday night.By contrast, the biggest losers in Brazil included European countries that have struggled to revive their own economies, as Germany did. This German team reflected a society that has become more diverse and tolerant, albeit with limits. This squad was much more ethnically diverse than the all-white 1990 champions. The German team in Brazil included defender J\u00e9rome Boateng, with roots in Ghana, and Sami Khedira, whose father was Tunisian.Speaking above the crackle of fireworks, Jos\u00e9 Nunez, praised the team\u2019s victory. \u201cThey earned it,\u201d said Mr. Nunez, 31, a house painter who said he was of Spanish descent but born in Frankfurt. \u201cThey played the best football.\u201dBut Mr. Nunez said it was important to keep the World Cup in perspective in light of more serious world events. Referring to the fighting in Gaza, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t forget that people are dying.\u201dAlison Smale reported from Berlin, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

{"Headline": "Cooling Inflation Raises Possibility of Stimulus in China", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s consumer inflation rate cooled slightly more than expected in June, government figures showed Wednesday, pointing to lingering weakness in the economy that could prompt Beijing to begin further stimulus measures to shore up growth.The consumer price index rose 2.3 percent in June from a year earlier, missing the forecast of 2.4 percent from analysts polled by Reuters and down from 2.5 percent in May, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics said. The producer price index dropped 1.1 percent, in its 28th straight month of decline, versus a market consensus for a fall of 1 percent, signaling that demand in the domestic economy remained lukewarm, despite some recent signs of stabilization.\u201cThe weak inflation data leaves more scope for Beijing to step up use of targeted measures and even opens the opportunity window for blanket easing policy, such as an interest-rate cut, to support economic growth,\u201d said Wang Jin, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai.Most economists predict that Beijing will introduce fresh stimulus measures in the coming months to ensure that economic growth meets the target of 7.5 percent, but they are divided over whether the government will stick to small-scale measures used so far or take more aggressive steps like interest rate cuts or a nationwide reduction in the amount of reserves that banks must hold.Policy makers are reluctant to announce a huge stimulus program like the one adopted during the 2008-9 global financial crisis, which increased inflationary pressures and left local governments with mountains of debt.\u201cSubdued inflation means monetary policy will have plenty of room to ease further over the coming months,\u201d Julia R Wang, an economist at HSBC, said in a note to clients. \u201cWe think the central bank will likely continue to do so in a targeted manner, provided that economic activity continues to show improvement.\u201dTing Lu, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, also forecast that the government would take further action. \u201cWe expect Beijing to continue rolling out a slew of small-scale measures to deliver the around 7.5 percent annual growth target,\u201d he said in a note to clients.The weaker June inflation reading mostly reflected lower prices for pork and vegetables. In the first half of this year, average consumer inflation was 2.3 percent, far below the official ceiling of 3.5 percent set by the government at the start of the year.Data for May and more recent factory and service sector activity surveys have suggested that China\u2019s economy is steadying after a weak start to the year. But analysts said easing consumer inflation and persistent factory-gate deflation showed that the recovery remained patchy.A cooling property market poses an additional risk, and conditions there could determine just how much more may be needed on the stimulus front to stabilize the broader economy.Beijing has stepped up policy support in recent months to give a lift to economic growth, which dipped to an 18-month low in the first quarter. The measures included targeted reserve requirement cuts for some banks, quicker fiscal disbursements, and hastened construction of railways and public housing projects.Premier Li Keqiang said this week that Chinese economic growth had sped up in the second quarter from the previous three months. But he added that the economy still faced downward pressure and that further modest stimulus measures would be needed to bolster activity.The central bank said on Monday that it would use a mix of monetary tools to keep overall liquidity at an appropriate level to support the economy.With inflation clearly not a threat for now, the government and central bank have the scope to continue loosening policies to bolster the economy.\u201cFurther monetary policy easing across the board will still be needed to help lift confidence in China\u2019s economy,\u201d economists at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said in a research note to clients.The economists said they believed that Beijing would reduce reserve requirement ratios for all of the country\u2019s banks in the third quarter. So far, it has relaxed the requirement only for banks that are significant lenders to small companies and the farming sector.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wealth of Ideas", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore it became a political philosophy, liberalism was not that difficult to define: A person was liberal if generous, catholic in taste or even excessively rotund. Liberal people may not have been universally admired, but few took to castigating them as dangerous to the health of the state. The opposite of \u201cliberal\u201d was not \u201cconservative\u201d but \u201cstrict.\u201d When Bassanio tells Portia in \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d that he will give her \u201cthe dearest ring in Venice,\u201d she replies, \u201cI see, sir, you are liberal in offers.\u201d No one in Shakespeare\u2019s audience would have concluded that the dissolute nobleman with whom she banters stood on the left side of the political spectrum.Once it did become a political term \u2014 its first significant appearance took place in Spain under Napoleonic occupation \u2014 liberalism, although now clearly identified with the political left, began almost immediately to run into considerable definitional difficulties. In the 19th century, a liberal could \u2014 in fact most liberals of that era did \u2014 distrust democracy; in the 20th, almost no one would confess to such a sin. Liberals could be nationalists or internationalists. They urged war and advocated peace. Some were open to parties to their left, such as socialists and Communists, while others were among the extreme left\u2019s fiercest critics. Down to today, those who insist that markets work best without interference often identify themselves as liberal, if of the \u201cclassical\u201d variety, but so do those \u201cmodern\u201d liberals who call on government to correct market failures. \u201cThe word \u2018liberal\u2019 is notoriously slippery,\u201d writes Edmund Fawcett, formerly of The Economist, as he begins \u201cLiberalism: The Life of an Idea,\u201d his richly informative historical tour of liberal leaders and concepts.His \u201cexperience as a journalist served him well,\u201d Fawcett says of the British sociologist Leonard Hobhouse. The same could be said about Fawcett. Widely read, apparently conversant in at least three languages and a vivacious writer \u2014 one German politician \u201chad a beard like a yew hedge and a frown of stubborn ferocity\u201d \u2014 Fawcett aims to make liberalism comprehensible to contemporary readers. To do so, he takes a commendably liberal approach, bringing as many within the tent as possible. Liberals, he insists, do not argue from a doctrinal checklist so much as they understand that conflict is unavoidable, distrust unjust authority, hold faith in progress and respect all, or at least most, people. It is more a way of doing politics than it is a fixed political position. The term is capacious enough to include both Jean-Paul Sartre and Milton Friedman, George Orwell along with Margaret Thatcher.Fawcett devotes roughly equal attention to liberalism\u2019s origins in the middle decades of the 19th century, its late-19th- and early-20th-century struggles with democracy, and its post-World War II resurgence, before briefly pondering its likely future. Names and events whiz by as he jumps from one country to another, offering synopses of innumerable books, some famous and others obscure, brief biographical vignettes and accounts of policies both successful and failed. Fawcett bends over backward to include nations. Germany, he insists, ought to be part of the liberal story, and he profiles figures largely unrecognizable to English-\u00adlanguage readers, such as Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch, an advocate of mutualism, otherwise known as the cooperative movement; as well as Bismarck\u2019s opponent Eugen Richter, he of the yewlike beard.A liberal surely ought to be inclusive, but Fawcett, in my view, is in this respect far too much so. The Savoyard royalist Joseph de Maistre, as anti-liberal a figure as one can find, is rightly called a \u201cconservative reactionary,\u201d but the Nazi lawyer Carl Schmitt, who comes in a close second, is characterized, wrongly, as \u201cambiguous.\u201d Because liberals accept conflict as inevitable, Fawcett discusses the ideas of John C. Calhoun, the South Carolina politician who drew up an elaborate scheme to protect minority rights. But Calhoun belongs with de Maistre and Schmitt, not James Madison (with whom Fawcett pairs him). \u201cWhatever form it took, over interests, beliefs or ways of life,\u201d as Fawcett himself characterizes the liberal perspective, \u201cthe thought was that conflict must be tamed, transformed into competition and made fruitful in trade, experiment and argument.\u201d Calhoun, by contrast, devoted his life to defending the narrow interests of slaveholders and justifying the brutal way of life that came with it. The conflict his passions helped bring about was famously irrepressible \u2014 and anything but fruitful.It is not Fawcett\u2019s task to award a prize to history\u2019s greatest liberal. Still, there is one thinker in this book whose ideas come up for discussion whenever he seeks to explain liberalism\u2019s most characteristic ideas. John Stuart Mill indeed deserves the honor. Although he could be snobbish toward the masses, Mill leaves much to admire. \u201cOn Liberty\u201d is a beautifully written, and highly teachable, introduction to liberal thinking. Inspired by the love of his life, Harriet Taylor, Mill wrote more sympathetically about women\u2019s equality than any other man of his time. His economic ideas, anything but rigid, changed to meet the conditions of changing economies. He hated slavery and took the North\u2019s side in the American Civil War. His essays on Bentham and Coleridge, which Fawcett cites with admiration, demonstrate his unerring ear for what even problematic thinkers can teach. \u201cNobody since has offered as many-sided or candid a statement of the conflicting pressures within the liberal creed,\u201d Fawcett writes of Mill. On this point he is completely correct.One will find in Fawcett\u2019s brief reflections on the future neither a liberal celebration \u00e0 la Francis Fukuyama nor bitter nostalgia about liberalism\u2019s decline into decadence \u00e0 la Robert Bork. We have come full circle to liberalism\u2019s origins, he believes, as once again we\u2019re faced with the task of bringing a humane and respectful order out of the chaos of the world around us. Far from being the sole product of the rich liberal democracies of the West, liberal ideas, he believes, offer enormous promise to those struggling for a better future in places like Iran, India and China. \u201cThey have work for many lifetimes,\u201d Fawcett concludes. \u201cIf something like that is close to true, it is too early to bury liberalism under a statue of hope.\u201dLIBERALISMThe Life of an IdeaBy Edmund Fawcett468 pp. Princeton University Press. $35.Alan Wolfe is the author of \u201cThe Future of Liberalism.\u201d His book on why diaspora is good for the Jews will be published in October.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "World Leaders Match Anger With Calls for Inquiry Into Ukraine Plane Crash", "Date": "2014-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Angered and dismayed by the downing of a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, European leaders cast about for some form of joint response to the tragedy on Friday. But beyond calls for an international inquiry, they showed few signs of immediately following the United States in imposing harsher sanctions on Russia.With sentiments ranging from shock to fury, political leaders across the globe urged a rapid, independent and international effort to investigate the crash, which killed 298 people and provoked accusations and counteraccusations about who brought the plane down.Speaking to reporters in Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, which has close economic ties with Moscow, said there were \u201cmany indications\u201d that the Malaysian airliner \u201cwas shot down.\u201d The Ukrainian government and its pro-Moscow separatist foes in eastern Ukraine, where the plane crashed, have blamed each other for bringing it down. American and Ukrainian officials say the jetliner was brought down by a Russian-made antiaircraft missile.But Ms. Merkel declined to answer repeated questions about whether she would support tougher sanctions against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, beyond the more limited measures to which the European Union has already agreed. The United States imposed a new and tougher round of sanctions on Russian companies and business executives on Wednesday before the downing of the airliner on Thursday.Rather, Ms. Merkel suggested that the best solution lay in ending the conflict.\u201cRussia\u2019s responsibility is clear,\u201d she said on Friday, calling on Mr. Putin and his government to do their part \u201cto find ways to reach a permanent cease-fire.\u201d\u201cIt will be a difficult path, but there is no alternative to a political solution,\u201d the chancellor told reporters.At her annual summer news conference with the Berlin press corps, Ms. Merkel suggested indirectly that France should halt its military exports to Russia, noting that Germany had stopped its military cooperation with Russia this year.\u201cWe have not introduced any export limits to specific sectors on the European side, so I cannot say anything at this time,\u201d she told reporters in Berlin. \u201cThe legal situation allows for such exports.\u201dMs. Merkel went on to point out that Germany had put \u201con ice\u201d a joint exercise with Russia. \u201cThat was our response to the situation at the moment,\u201d she said.Officials in Brussels said it was possible that the European Union would set a deadline to list additional Russian oligarchs and companies as part of a toughened European sanctions policy announced this week.But the bloc was likely to remain deeply divided between those member states ready to confront Moscow and those that are reluctant, the officials said.The formal deadline for the European listings is the end of this month, but they might now be published on Tuesday or shortly afterward. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under the bloc\u2019s protocols, said it was also possible that European leaders would hold a previously unscheduled summit next week.At that gathering, they might discuss questions about whether France should freeze weapons sales to Russia and whether to send military aid to Ukraine. In the meantime, investigators will seek to determine whether the jetliner was struck by a Russian-supplied surface-to-air missile, as Ukrainian officials have insisted.Times journalists would like to learn more about the victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.The Europeans would require a high burden of proof about Russian complicity before taking measures that would strike at Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle, the officials said, particularly those involved in the Russian energy supplies on which many European economies depend.For his part, Mr. Putin called on Friday for a \u201cthorough and unbiased\u201d inquiry into the disaster.He also spoke with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who broke off a vacation after learning that a majority of those who died in the crash were Dutch. The Netherlands has declared a national day of mourning for the 154 Dutch citizens reported killed.In a telephone conversation with Mr. Rutte, the Russian leader \u201cunderlined that the tragedy yet again highlighted the need for the swiftest peaceful solution to the acute crisis in Ukraine,\u201d the Kremlin said in a statement, echoing earlier Russian comments about the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine, during which pro-Moscow separatists have recently claimed to have shot down Ukrainian military transport planes.Later on Friday, Mr. Putin attended a religious ceremony at the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, a monastery north of Moscow, as scheduled. He spoke briefly about the historical importance of the Russian Orthodox faith, but made no reference to current events in Ukraine.In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron summoned a meeting of the high-level crisis response committee known as Cobra, which debates matters of national security. Nine Britons were reported to be among the dead from Flight 17. The committee takes its name from the location of its meetings in Cabinet Office Briefing Room A.\u201cIf, as seems possible, this was brought down, then those responsible must be brought to account, and we must lose no time in doing that,\u201d Mr. Cameron said after the meeting. \u201cIt is an absolutely shocking incident and cannot be allowed to stand.\u201dThe harshest public criticism came from Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia, who said that the Russian response to the crash was \u201cdeeply, deeply unsatisfactory.\u201d The dead were reported to have included 28 Australians. The Russian ambassador to Australia had met earlier with the foreign minister, Julie Bishop.A Malaysia Airlines flight with nearly 300 people aboard crashed in eastern Ukraine near the Russian border on July 17.\u201cThe initial response of the Russian ambassador was to blame Ukraine for this, and I have to say that is deeply, deeply unsatisfactory,\u201d Mr. Abbott said, adding that \u201cthe idea that Russia can somehow say that none of this has anything to do with them because it happened in Ukrainian airspace frankly does not stand up to any serious scrutiny.\u201d\u201cThis looks less like an accident than a crime,\u201d he said, \u201cand if so, the perpetrators must be brought to justice.\u201dIn France, officials said they were still trying to determine whether any French citizens had been on the flight. Initially, the foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said there had been at least four French passengers, but then said it was unclear.Britain has submitted a United Nations resolution calling for an international investigation into the crash. A proposal was expected to be discussed at a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council in New York on Friday. The British call for an international inquiry has been echoed by the White House; the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon; and the NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen.\u201cIt is important that a full international investigation should be launched immediately, without any hindrance, to establish the facts and that those who may be responsible are swiftly brought to justice,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen said in a statement.The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said it had conducted two videoconferences with pro-Russian separatist groups, which had agreed to secure the site of the crash; to provide safe access for rescue teams and for national and international investigators; and to cooperate with the Ukrainian authorities.In a barely veiled criticism of Russia and the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine, he told reporters in Warsaw, \u201cThis is how delivering advanced weapons to bandits ends.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time to Worry About Rising Confidence?", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 Confidence in the global economy is steadily improving, as evidenced by the bullish behavior of financial markets and by increasingly confident comments from companies and policy makers over the past few weeks.While I have generally argued in favor of a robust recovery, both in the world economy and in financial markets, it is when investors get uniformly bullish that the pessimistic case deserves more attention. Many distinguished economists believe that the current improvement in global conditions is just a blip and that the world faces years, if not decades, of \u201csecular stagnation.\u201d How seriously should we take these foreboding statements? The good news is that there is not much evidence of secular stagnation in global statistics. For the world economy as a whole, the \u201cnew normal\u201d since 2008 has not, in fact, been very different from the precrisis period. The average growth of the global economy from 1988 to 2007 \u2014 the 20 years before the crisis \u2014 was 3.6 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s World Economic Outlook database. The I.M.F.\u2019s latest forecast for 2014 is the same: 3.6 percent, although Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F. managing director, hinted at a modest downgrade this week.At first sight this continuity from the precrisis decades seems hard to square with the slowdown in economic activity in all major economies since 2008. The I.M.F. expects only 2.2 percent growth this year in the developed countries, compared with an average of 2.8 percent during the two decades before the crisis. In the emerging economies, meanwhile, growth is projected at 4.8 percent this year, slightly below the 4.9 percent of the precrisis decades. Since both emerging and developed economies have weakened, how can it be that the world economy as a whole has not slowed down? The answer is the shifting balance of economic activity from slower advanced economies to faster-growing developing economies.Emerging economies now account for 51 percent of global economic activity, compared with 36 percent in 1994. This means that emerging economies, even as they slow, contribute more than ever to global growth. China, for example is now growing at a rate of around 7 percent, instead of the 10 percent it achieved in the precrisis decades. But that 7 percent growth in gross domestic product, from a base of $10 trillion, adds $700 billion to global demand, more than three times what China added 15 years ago, when it was growing by 10 percent annually from a base of $2 trillion. Now for the bad news. While the steady or slightly accelerating global growth rates predicted by the I.M.F. are the most likely outcome, they may not be achievable because of three imbalances \u2014 social, geographical and demographic \u2014 that seem to be deeply embedded in the structure of global capitalism today. These three imbalances are causing a weakening of demand, creating excess savings and driving the buildup of borrowing and lending that has been both a cause and consequence of the global financial crisis. The most dangerous imbalance is in the distribution of wealth and income. Income disparities have become a topic of heated political and moral controversy, but their macroeconomic effects have attracted less attention. The mechanism whereby income inequality causes economic stagnation was clearly recognized by Karl Marx and other 19th-century writers. If too much of the income created by capitalism\u2019s capacity to increase production flows to people who are already rich and are likely to save rather than spend these incomes, then crises of underconsumption become almost inevitable. And the only way to avert such crises of underconsumption is to create financial systems that recycle excess income from rich savers to poorer consumers via a buildup of debt. Geographical imbalances are a second major cause of weak demand. The \u201cglobal imbalance\u201d that generated great controversy before the crisis was between the United States and Asia. This has largely disappeared as American consumption and borrowing have subsided, while China and Japan have shifted away from export-driven growth models. But in the meantime, an equally troublesome imbalance has emerged between Germany and the rest of Europe.Germany\u2019s current account surplus of 7 percent of G.D.P. is now larger and more persistent than the Japanese or Chinese surpluses before the crisis. Yet on the global stage, Germany is not subjected to the same sort of pressures. And Germany\u2019s political dominance in Europe makes it immune to the kind of pressure for policy changes that the United States applied to Japan and China. At the same time, the existence of the euro rules out the currency adjustments that ultimately removed the imbalances between Asia and the United States. The third imbalance is demographic. Believers in \u201csecular stagnation\u201d have drawn attention to the downward pressure on labor supply as baby boomers retire. But this is unimportant in a period of high unemployment, when there is no shortage of workers to limit economic output. The bigger impact of an aging population is on macroeconomic demand, especially when this problem is aggravated by social and labor policies that shift incomes and economic opportunities in favor of retirees and older workers at the expense of younger generations. Since 2008, governments the world over have assiduously protected or even increased pensions and healthcare \u201centitlements,\u201d while slashing spending on welfare, education, family policies and child support. This redistribution of income toward older voters has been exacerbated by employment policies that have prioritized job protection for older workers, especially in Europe, over flexibility and job creation policies that would provide opportunities for the young. Because the aging baby boomers are already richer than their children and grandchildren, this policy imbalance has widened wealth inequalities, forced young people deeper into debt, increased excess savings and added to deflationary demand pressures. But given the electoral weight of older voters, the political favoritism for baby boomers is deeply entrenched in most modern democracies. If the present cyclical recovery fizzles out and really does turn into secular stagnation, these three imbalances will be largely to blame. Unfortunately, the politics of income distribution, geographic rebalancing and intergenerational equity are so difficult that all these imbalances are likely to persist for many years ahead.

{"Headline": "Beyond Rangel, Harlem Wrestles With Its Identity", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the streets of Harlem the weekend before the Democratic primary for his congressional seat, Representative Charles B. Rangel and his closest opponent, a Dominican-born state senator, Adriano D. Espaillat, carried on an age-old campaign tradition, snaking along their routes in dueling caravans, blasting songs like \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d and \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d from the loudspeakers of their campaign trucks.The dueling processions repeatedly tangled at intersections with double-decker tour buses filled with mostly white out-of-towners gawking at the cavalcades as though they were landmarks, remnants of the forces and movements that helped shape Harlem into one of New York City\u2019s most important cultural and political centers.It was the kind of inside-outside juxtaposition that residents of this northern Manhattan neighborhood have become accustomed to. Yet in interviews over the course of the campaign and since, residents suggested that the matter of who would represent the community in Congress might be slightly overheated. Political leaders alone, they kept saying, would not determine Harlem\u2019s future.A more important question: What does Harlem, in this day and age, really represent?\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to determine,\u201d said Neal Shoemaker, a Harlem native who grew up in the Martin Luther King Jr. Towers, a housing project on Lenox Avenue, and now runs a successful walking tour of the community. \u201cHarlem\u2019s identity is being formed as we speak. It\u2019s like a mother baking a cake before it\u2019s in an oven. Let it bake.\u201dThe hard-fought campaign \u2014 which Mr. Rangel held on to win, assuring himself of the chance to step down voluntarily in a year or two because he faces no Republican opponent in the fall \u2014 drew heavy news coverage, a sign of the incumbent\u2019s fame, if not his continued influence. But it also offered a look at a community that is very much in flux: gentrifying, but with pockets of persistent poverty; increasingly multicultural, but still an African-American population center.That Mr. Rangel, 84, was in the race at all meant that history and nostalgia would be much in the air, and in the news. The Harlem where the streets bubbled with debates led by W. E. B. DuBois, Malcolm X or Marcus Garvey is long gone. But Mr. Rangel had unseated the first black congressman from New York, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., in 1970 and in the years since, Harlem has produced the city\u2019s first black mayor, David N. Dinkins, and the state\u2019s first black governor, David A. Paterson.Yet residents do not seem to be yearning for another Powell, or the next Rangel \u2014 or even this one \u2014 to lead them. At one time, the community relied on its elected representatives to project Harlem\u2019s influence on a national stage. Now, despite Mr. Rangel\u2019s victory, Harlem voters make up less than half of the congressional district, which includes a swath of the Bronx; more than half the district\u2019s voting-eligible residents are Hispanics.More than ever, Harlem is less a clearly identified voting bloc than an idea. A brand.Stakeholders like Mr. Shoemaker, who employs young high school students from the project where he grew up, said they were more intent on figuring out how to sell Harlem without selling out.Viewed from on top of those tour buses, Harlem is banking on a future tied to its legacy. Its currency is authenticity, a term that Harlem stakeholders added to their conversations as though pouring hot sauce and syrup over an order of chicken and waffles.Basil Smikle, a political consultant who once ran for the State Senate, said the community was in a predicament, its future entangled with its past. \u201cWhen I look and think about Harlem, I see two very specific issues: the political economy and authenticity,\u201d he said, speaking of Harlem as a brand.\u201cThere is a general fear among older residents that they are being displaced,\u201d he added. \u201cMany have moved or passed away. And with the loss of older individuals who\u2019ve maintained the history and culture, there is a loss.\u201dMr. Smikle said that when he was running for office, he could not convince longtime residents that he was a Harlemite. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 17 years. I\u2019m not from here. I\u2019m inauthentic,\u201d he said, recalling the beliefs of older voters.Marcus Samuelsson, the chef and entrepreneur behind Red Rooster restaurant on Lenox Avenue off West 125th Street, said he was seeking to give Harlem \u201cnormalcy.\u201dMr. Samuelsson defined that as the condition in the kind of neighborhoods where seasonal vegetables and fruits are readily available and inexpensive, where children can walk to good public schools, where methadone clinics are not clustered on a single block, and where Citi Bike, the bicycle-sharing program, does not ignore the neighborhood.For all of its new condominiums and apartments and restaurants, Harlem is not quite normal, he said: \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. People in Harlem don\u2019t ride bikes? Come on.\u201dThe demand for change is coming from a changing population. Black people make up only about 38 percent of the population of greater Harlem, which encompasses East Harlem and Hamilton Heights. In central Harlem, the overall population has risen to 125,000, from 109,000 in 2000. But only 61 percent are black, fewer than at any time since Mr. Rangel was first elected in 1970. Hispanics make up a fifth of central Harlem\u2019s residents, and whites, who barely registered in the 1990 census, now number more than 14,000, or 11 percent.The white influx still draws notice. \u201cThere will be white people who say \u2018I was born and raised in Harlem,\u2019 and they won\u2019t be lying,\u201d Mr. Shoemaker marveled.The shift has brought Harlem amenities already enjoyed in other parts of New York. There is a gaping lot fenced off on 125th Street, the future home of Whole Foods.Barbara Askins, president and chief executive of the 125th Street Business Improvement District, described a \u201cbalancing act between the business needs and social needs\u201d that she said different groups of people were trying to address.Ms. Askins recalled how residents came together to combat youth violence at the Grant Houses, a public-housing project. \u201cThat\u2019s not dependent on politics, but it is politics,\u201d she said.The same people who are maintaining and promoting Harlem as a brand are quietly involved in creating jobs and affordable housing.Mr. Shoemaker, 45, who runs Harlem Heritage Tours, said Harlem had to capitalize on its history and cachet to help low-income residents. In the days after the primary last Tuesday, when he was not guiding visitors through the neighborhood, he was attending the graduations of students who live in it, including in the project where he grew up.One young man came by on his bike.\u201cI didn\u2019t see you at the graduation today,\u201d Mr. Shoemaker said.The teenager explained that he did not pass a test required for graduation. He could retake it in August.\u201cI still love you,\u201d Mr. Shoemaker said, giving him a lean-in handshake. \u201cCome by in the morning. Sell some T-shirts.\u201dMr. Shoemaker employs young people, allowing them to make a little money and soak up Harlem\u2019s history. He called his tours authentic because he employs native Harlem residents as guides.That history remains relevant in the present, and not just as something to sell.Mr. Shoemaker\u2019s own path in life owed much to the programs pushed by politicians decades earlier, he said. He attended City University of New York thanks to assistance from a program that Adam Clayton Powell Jr. championed in Congress, though he did not realize it then. \u201cAll I knew is I was away from the gunshots of my neighborhood and felt safe,\u201d he said.Mr. Smikle, the political consultant, said the first apartment he lived in was rented through the Abyssinian Baptist Church, which developed real estate and is credited with driving Harlem\u2019s revitalization, later complemented by the Empowerment Zone program that Mr. Rangel helped create in the 1990s.Mr. Samuelsson, the chef, eschews politics, he said in an interview: \u201cI don\u2019t know politics. I know food.\u201d Still, he had Mayor Bill de Blasio and former President Bill Clinton at his side in May when he announced a new food and wine festival, Harlem EatUp!Mr. Clinton had signed the Empowerment Zone program into law, and made headlines when he opened an office in Harlem in 2001, showcasing the area\u2019s revitalization. A decade later, he moved most of the foundation\u2019s operations to Lower Manhattan. There was no outrage; Harlem no longer needed a former president.On the Sunday before the election, Mr. Rangel brought his entourage to a half-dozen churches to ask voters for another two years.Harlem\u2019s black churches, like those around the country, have been powerful institutions for generations. Mr. Powell, whom Mr. Rangel defeated, had been pastor of Abyssinian.But as Mr. Rangel spoke from pulpit after pulpit, his audiences almost always included, seated to the rear, or in a special section off to the side, a cluster of tourists who probably arrived expecting to hear a sermon or the choir.They were witnessing history instead.Mr. Rangel\u2019s most vocal surrogate that day was Letitia James, the city\u2019s public advocate and the first black woman to hold citywide public office.Ms. James was not born or raised in Harlem. At Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, she told the congregation that she brought greetings from her own church \u201cin a place far away called Brooklyn.\u201dEarlier in the campaign, in one of the debates, Errol Louis of NY1 asked a series of what were supposed to be yes-or-no questions. \u201cMr. Rangel, is Harlem still the capital of black America?\u201d he asked.Mr. Rangel thought about it. \u201cWell, in terms of history, and culture and music and jazz and churches and in my heart, you bet your sweet life,\u201d he said.No mention of politics. No yes or no.An earlier version of this article misstated the address of Red Rooster restaurant in Harlem. It is on Lenox Avenue near West 125th Street, not East 125th Street.An article on July 1 about the changing nature of Harlem misstated the way the Abyssinian Baptist Church, a leading institution in the neighborhood, obtained financing to develop real estate. It used local and federal funding, not money from the Empowerment Zone program.Advertisement"}

But they will litigate.\u201cTheir big idea has been to sue me,\u201d the president said earlier this month, unable to sustain a giggle. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re spending time on.\u201dTo Boehner, the stunt, brought to you by the talk radio and Fox News wacko-sphere, is no laughing matter. He says the imperial president has governed by executive order, overstepping a Congress that will not govern by any order. Obama has issued 182 executive orders in his presidency, through the end of June. The tyrant.So far, legal experts have reacted to Boehner\u2019s potential lawsuit with the rhetorical equivalent of guffawing until their morning coffee runs out their noses. This might include Chief Justice John Roberts, who has sniffed at another political lawsuit because the plaintiffs lacked standing \u2014 that is, someone seeking \u201crelief for an injury that affects him in a personal and individual way,\u201d as Roberts wrote.Earlier this week, a federal judge appointed by George W. Bush threw out a lawsuit by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin against a health care provision, saying the Tea Party Republican had failed to show how he had been personally harmed by the law.So, what Boehner needs is a plaintiff in a neck brace. Somebody fragile, and sympathetic-looking. He needs that person to be a member of Congress. And he needs that person to have suffered for lack of health insurance because of President Obama. The character played by Matthew McConaughey in \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer,\u201d an operator who practiced law out of a car, had better stuff to work with than this.Another problem: Republicans have complained for decades about \u201cactivist judges\u201d doing the work that legislators are supposed to do. Judges should be referees, not lawmakers or micro-managers. But here, Boehner would be asking a court to step in and require that President Obama\u2019s signature law be managed a certain way.Presidents routinely delay, modify or defer enforcement of certain laws. President George W. Bush decided \u2014 like some kind of monarch! \u2014 to waive penalty fees on seniors who missed a sign-up deadline for prescription drug coverage in 2006. He was ignoring a part of his own law. And what Wall Street-backed Republican is complaining about the many delays in implementing the Dodd-Frank Act?That Bush appointee who threw out Senator Johnson\u2019s claim, Judge William C. Griesbach, sent a warning shot in Boehner\u2019s direction with his language. He wrote that \u201cdisputes between the executive and legislative branches over the extent of their respective powers are to be resolved through the political process, not by decisions issued by federal judges.\u201dThe political process. You know \u2014 votes and things, lawmaking. That would require the House to do something. Ha! A bill to raise the minimum wage will not even come up for a vote. Immigration reform is dead for the year, Boehner said recently \u2014 no vote allowed. Even a fellow Republican, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, noted that if Boehner really wanted to do something to prevent the president from issuing more executive orders, he could, um, pass legislation.Too late for that. After next week, it\u2019s vacation \u2014 for all of August, and into September. That will be followed by another loooooong break, from the first week of October until Election Day in November. This will give Boehner\u2019s nonperforming lawmakers plenty of time to ask a dispirited electorate to return them so they can sit on their hands for another two years.The primaries this year have produced record-low turnout, because of voters who have gotten nothing from their politicians. We could sue them, with standing. Or we could do what they refuse to do \u2014 take a vote of real consequence.Gail Collins is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Push to Ban Fracking Puts Denton in Fight Over Owners\u2019 Rights", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneDENTON \u2014 Debbie Ingram understands the importance of Texas\u2019 oil and gas industry, and she enjoys the look of a lit-up drilling rig rising in the nighttime sky. But a few months of living about 400 feet from a natural gas well \u2014 the source of a cacophony of noises and nauseating fumes that, at times, have overtaken her brick house \u2014 prompted her to join hundreds of others pushing back against the industry in this North Texas city. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sit on the back porch because I couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d said Ms. Ingram, 67, wearing a black T-shirt reading \u201cFrack Free Denton,\u201d the name of the grass-roots group spearheading that opposition.The group could have its moment in November. Voters will decide whether the city will become the state\u2019s first to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking \u2014 the method of oil and gas extraction that has led to a domestic energy boom. But passage of a ban would probably trigger another fracking fight: a legal clash over a city\u2019s power to regulate for health and safety and the rights of mineral owners to develop their resources. The outcome could reshape Texas law at a time when drilling is causing tension in some urban areas.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be one of those first-time tests, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a clear answer out there in Texas law,\u201d said Jim Bradbury, a Fort Worth lawyer who focuses on environmental and energy issues. \u201cIf one community after another continues to say \u2018Not in my backyard,\u2019 then before long, a tsunami of exclusion will jeopardize our freedom as a country,\u201d said Chris Faulkner, the chief executive of Breitling Energy in Dallas, one of many industry representatives who spoke at City Hall before the Council\u2019s vote. \u201cIf other cities were to follow your lead, then we could potentially, one day, see a ban on drilling within all cities in Texas,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf that were to happen, I believe that our country, our state, its citizens and its school children would be severely harmed.\u201dProponents of the ban called the measure a last-ditch effort to address noise and toxic fumes that spew from wells just beyond their backyards, after loopholes and previous zoning decisions have rendered unenforceable changes to the city\u2019s drilling ordinance, including a 1,200-foot setback from homes, schools and other structures. Opponents argue that the move would effectively halt all drilling inside Denton, costing mineral owners and the local economy millions of dollars and exposing the city to expensive litigation.Though Texas courts have occasionally considered cities\u2019 drilling regulations, they have yet to see a case of such size and scope, legal experts say. Texas law says the state intends its mineral resources to be \u201cfully and effectively exploited,\u201d but courts have said the power is not absolute. The Railroad Commission has jurisdiction over all oil and gas wells in the state, with authority to adopt \u201call necessary rules for governing and regulating persons and their operations.\u201d Local governments have the right to impose reasonable health and safety restrictions, and the Legislature has granted most Texas cities, including Denton, the power to \u201cregulate exploration and development of mineral interests.\u201dThe state has long regulated most aspects of drilling, including well integrity, pipeline safety, and air and water impact, while cities have typically controlled noise and authorized the location of wells or related facilities like compressor stations. Now, a key question is where fracking falls in that spectrum. Thomas R. Phillips, chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court from 1988 to 2004, said he would expect courts to side with the energy industry \u2014 by ruling that the ban unconstitutionally supersedes state law or that it makes gas beneath the city too difficult to tap and amounts to a taking.Mr. Phillips, now a lawyer with the firm of Baker Botts, who was asked to review the proposal for the Texas Oil and Gas Association, said state law gave cities less stringent options for protecting health and safety at well sites, and that Denton \u201ccan\u2019t just say no\u201d to fracking.Other legal experts acknowledge that state high courts tend to favor oil and gas interests, but say that Denton could make a compelling argument that a fracking ban would not wipe out all options to drill.\u201cTo say that this is a slam dunk, it\u2019s a taking, I think that\u2019s painting with an overly broad brush,\u201d said Terrence Welch, a lawyer who has helped write drilling ordinances in Texas cities. \u201cThe property \u2014 the mineral estate isn\u2019t left valueless. You can drill, but you just can\u2019t frack.\u201d Mr. Bradbury, the Fort Worth lawyer, agreed and noted that new technology has enabled drillers to reach resources thousands of feet away at various angles. He suggested that some companies might reach Denton\u2019s gas from outside city limits. \u201cYou can\u2019t take gas and oil out of Texas,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what Texas is.\u201d jmalewitz@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coordinated Sanctions Aim at Russia\u2019s Ability to Tap Its Oil Reserves", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States and Europe kicked off a joint effort on Tuesday intended to curb Russia\u2019s long-term ability to develop new oil resources, taking aim at the Kremlin\u2019s premier source of wealth and power in retaliation for its intervention in Ukraine.In announcing coordinated sanctions, American and European leaders went beyond previous moves against banking and defense industries in an effort to curtail Russia\u2019s access to Western technology as it seeks to tap new Arctic, deep sea and shale oil reserves. The goal was not to inhibit current oil production but to cloud Russia\u2019s energy future.The new strategy took direct aim at the economic foundation of Russia, which holds the largest combined oil and gas reserves in the world. The growth of the oil industry in the last two decades has powered Russia\u2019s economic and geopolitical resurgence since the collapse of the Soviet Union and enriched allies of President Vladimir V. Putin. Russia pumps about 10.5 million barrels of oil a day, making it among the largest producers.\u201cThe biggest edge that Western energy companies still have is their technological edge \u2014 that\u2019s why these sanctions have the potential to have significant impact,\u201d said Michael A. Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cChinese companies can\u2019t step in and provide shale technology where U.S. companies are blocked. They can provide capital; they can provide people. They can\u2019t fill in on the technology front.\u201dThe technology cutoff could be important because Russia is only now at the early stages of developing new Arctic, deep sea and shale resources. Most of its current production comes from depleted Siberian deposits that will eventually run out. And several Western oil companies have been working with Russia to expand their resources.ExxonMobil has a joint venture with Rosneft, the state-owned oil giant, to develop Arctic oil, and is scheduled to start drilling in the Kara Sea within weeks. BP, which owns 19.75 percent of Rosneft, just signed a joint venture with the Russian firm in May to search for shale oil in the Volga-Urals region. Even though BP announced higher quarterly profits on Tuesday, its stock was hammered by the sanctions news, falling 3 percent. BP warned investors bluntly that further sanctions \u201ccould adversely impact our business and strategic objectives in Russia.\u201dDan Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said the new energy measures underscored how much ties had deteriorated. \u201cA year ago, Western collaboration with Russia\u2019s energy sector was one of the bright spots in what had become a dour relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cNo longer.\u201dThe carefully orchestrated actions on both sides of the Atlantic were intended to demonstrate solidarity in the face of what American and European officials say has been a stark escalation by Russia in the insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Until now, European leaders had resisted the broader sorts of actions they agreed to on Tuesday, and their decision to pursue them reflected increasing alarm that Russia was not only helping separatists in Ukraine but directly involving itself in the fighting.They are \u201cmeant as a strong warning,\u201d Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, said in a statement on Tuesday that was joined by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission. \u201cDestabilizing Ukraine, or any other Eastern European neighboring state, will bring heavy costs,\u201d the statement said.President Obama said Russia\u2019s economy would continue to suffer until it reversed course. \u201cToday is a reminder that the United States means what it says, and we will rally the international community in standing up for the rights and freedom of people around the world,\u201d he told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.Mr. Obama said the fact that Europe was now joining the United States in broader measures meant the moves would \u201chave an even bigger bite,\u201d but in response to reporters\u2019 questions, he said it was \u201cnot a new Cold War\u201d between the two countries. He also made clear he was not considering providing arms to Ukraine\u2019s government, as some Republicans have suggested, as it tries to put down the pro-Russian insurgency.\u201cThey are better armed than the separatists,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue is, \u2018How do we prevent bloodshed in eastern Ukraine?\u2019 We\u2019re trying to avoid that. And the main tool that we have to influence Russian behavior at this point is the impact that it\u2019s having on its economy.\u201dThe American and European actions were intended to largely, though not precisely, match each other. The United States cut off three more Russian banks, including the giant VTB Bank, from medium- and long-term capital markets and barred Americans from doing business with the United Shipbuilding Corporation, a large state-owned firm created by Mr. Putin. The Obama administration also formally suspended export credit and development finance to Russia.The European Union adopted similar restrictions on capital markets and applied them to Russian state-owned banks. It imposed an embargo on new arms sales to Russia and limited sales of equipment with both civilian and military uses to Russian military buyers. Europe also approved new sanctions against at least three close Putin associates, but did not identify them publicly.European governments moved ahead despite concerns that Europe would pay an economic price for confronting the Kremlin more aggressively. While their actions went far beyond any previously taken against Russia over the Ukraine crisis, they were tailored to minimize their own costs. The arms embargo, for instance, applies only to future sales, not to the much-debated delivery by France of Mistral-class helicopter carriers that resemble bigger aircraft carriers. And the energy technology restrictions do not apply to Russian natural gas, on which Europe relies heavily.The new sanctions could take effect as soon as Friday, though the necessary legal formalities would most likely to take longer to complete, officials said.On Twitter, the president of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaite, praised the decision \u201con a wide range of sanctions on Russia.\u201d But she expressed unease that France would be able to maintain its naval deal with Moscow. \u201cUnfortunately, nothing to stop the deal of Mistral yet,\u201d she wrote. Lithuania is one of five European Union states that are close to or border Russia. Mr. Van Rompuy departed from the usual cautious language of Europe\u2019s declarations by condemning Russia for actions that \u201ccannot be accepted in 21st-century Europe,\u201d including \u201cillegal annexation of territory\u201d \u2014 a reference to Crimea \u2014 \u201cand deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country.\u201d He also cited the \u201canger and frustration\u201d over the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over rebel-held territory on July 17 and \u201cthe delays in providing international access to the site of the air crash, the tampering with the remains of the plane, and the disrespectful handling of the deceased.\u201dAlthough European commerce with Russia will probably decline because of the sanctions, where the measures are expected to more severely affect Russia are the restrictions on the ability of Russian banks to raise money in Europe and the United States. \u201cThese sanctions can have quite a substantial chilling effect on the Russian economy,\u201d said Adam Slater, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cThat is probably a quite effective way to put pressure on Russia.\u201dStill, it could take time for the effects to be felt by ordinary Russians, and some analysts expected the Kremlin to shrug them off, at least publicly.

Buffett and Bill Gates send a timely and important message to Congress to regulate the flow of immigrants coming to the United States. They highlight the value to the United States that would come from revising two current policies to permit more liberal granting of visas and citizenship to graduates of American universities and people bringing with them substantial money to invest here.Both are important. But the history of immigration to this country is overwhelmingly a saga of poor and even destitute people who started at the bottom. They are not college graduates or investors, and few come with the sense of entitlement that comes with a degree or money. They are every bit as important to the American construction and agriculture industries as foreign graduates are to the tech industry.Construction and farm work are historically where immigrants begin, where they are needed now and where the jobs are less attractive. Perhaps it\u2019s too much to expect three very wealthy men to identify with people and businesses that are not part of today\u2019s tech and investor classes.To the Editor:\u201cBreak the Immigration Impasse\u201d is to be applauded. This well-reasoned and collaborative article should serve as a template for positions on immigration reform to be included in the platforms of the Republican and Democratic Parties.Despite the stalemate currently caused by Speaker John A. Boehner\u2019s refusal to allow a middle-ground immigration bill to reach the floor of the House, the tide is turning, as shown by the sentiments reflected in this article. If only the great majority of moderates on this issue could get together, as these three writers have, we could get this thorny issue on its way to resolution.To the Editor:Sheldon G. Adelson, Warren E. Buffett and Bill Gates plead with Congress to produce a consensual, humane immigration bill and policy changes that would also enhance our economy. By citing the desirable \u201ctalented graduate\u201d and \u201cimmigrant investor\u201d reforms and repeatedly stressing the primacy of American self-interest, these three titans of capitalism are actually promoting a modern form of colonialism.Aggressively granting visas to American-educated legal immigrants with graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering or mathematics will drain their countries of able, productive, innovative members. Rewarding wealthy foreigners with American citizenship in return for capital investment diminishes the money available for financing development in their home nations.Historically, colonial powers scoured physical resources from less developed countries. We should not now bleed away their intellectual and financial resources. Mr. Littman, a retired doctor, served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia from 1962-1964. Ms. Littman is a retired sociologist.To the Editor:I am aware of the basic political differences between the writers of the Op-Ed article. In it, they claim that despite their differences, they could come to an agreement on the language of an immigration reform bill. I wish to challenge them to do so, and then present this draft legislation to the do-nothing Congress. If we can\u2019t live with a bill drafted by these three, then I despair for our democratic system.To the Editor:\u201cBreak the Immigration Impasse\u201d is tone deaf to the actual illegal immigration crisis taking place on our southern border. Thankfully, public policy decisions remain the domain of policy makers and are not left to chief executives.Forget the 11 million illegal immigrants already in residence; ignore the recent influx of more than 52,000 children just these past eight months; disregard our porous border.No, the writers are not much concerned about these little details; they simply want Congress to pass a new immigration law that keeps \u201ctalented\u201d graduates in the United States and opens up the EB-5 \u201cimmigrant investor program.\u201d My trust in government is nearly gone; now my faith in the wisdom of corporate America is starting to crumble.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Still at Odds With China", "Date": "2014-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialA more assertive China under President Xi Jinping, however, has emerged in the past year, raising doubts about its commitment to peaceful evolution and severely straining its relationship with the United States. High-level talks between Chinese and American officials in Beijing last week were minimally productive, but they left largely unresolved profound differences on major issues that, if not managed carefully, could have damaging consequences. For a long time, it seemed as if the wisest diplomatic course was to downplay worries over China\u2019s growing strength and focus instead on cooperation. American officials still do that publicly, as Mr. Kerry did on Thursday when he sought to reassure his hosts that the administration\u2019s network of alliances in Asia is not part of a \u201cstrategy to try to push back against or be in conflict with China.\u201d But there are many reasons to question whether China really is committed to peaceful coexistence and to hope that the United States and its allies in the region will act more firmly to protect their interests in freedom of the seas and an open political and economic order.Getting American policy right is essential. Cooperation between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, is vital to global stability. There is nothing to be gained by pushing China, which has its own concerns about America\u2019s role in Asia, into a corner. At the same time, China must be made to understand that nothing good can come of its bullying, which frightens other Asian nations and inevitably draws them closer to the United States.

{"Headline": "A Damaging Distance", "Date": "2014-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisDAYS after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was gunned down in 1995 by an Israeli Jew who opposed compromise with the Palestinians, Shimon Peres, the acting prime minister, held a news conference. He was asked why more had not been done to protect Mr. Rabin from people like his assassin, Yigal Amir. Mr. Peres replied that it had never occurred to the authorities that a Jew could do such a thing. I was at that news conference and have thought often of that remarkable assertion in recent weeks as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has descended into an ugly blood feud. When three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped in the West Bank while hitchhiking home last month, Israeli security forces searching for them took the opportunity to arrest hundreds of Palestinians associated with Hamas. It was commonly claimed among Palestinians either that the kidnapping was an invention used to create a pretext for this latest suppression or that Jews themselves had carried it out. A week and a half ago, after the bodies of the three were found and a Palestinian teenager was kidnapped and burned alive by Israeli extremists in an act of revenge, many Israelis claimed that it could not have been done by Jews. Such an act of violent torture, they said, was what Muslims do to one another in honor killings; Jews are incapable of such things.The French philosopher Ernest Renan once defined a nation as \u201ca group of people united by a mistaken view about the past and a hatred of their neighbors.\u201d And while that arguably applies to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, my sense is that the deterioration we are witnessing results from something else \u2014 the growing human distance between Israelis and Palestinians who once knew each other intimately and are now virtual strangers. The change has taken place over the past 10 to 15 years because it was widely felt that mixing caused trouble and the two peoples needed to be separated if they were ever to live side by side. A result, however, has been a heightened dehumanization that has allowed the murder of four teenagers to escalate in just a few days into a series of devastating Israeli airstrikes that have killed scores and Palestinian rocket attacks that have displaced thousands.\u00a0During the 1980s and \u201990s, tens of thousands of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip worked in Israel. They learned Hebrew and built relations with their Israeli employers. They watched Israeli television (there was little else available), and many developed a cautious but unmistakable admiration for Israeli politics and public accountability. When Palestinians talked of building a state, it was not uncommon to hear members of their elite refer to Israel as a model. They witnessed the robust (sometimes brutal) nature of public discourse in Israel, and many liked what they saw. In turn, Israelis would venture on weekends into the West Bank, where they would get their cars fixed, shop for vegetables and snack on plates of unparalleled hummus. They attended weddings of their Palestinian employees and their children. Some Israelis and Palestinians even went into business together. The relationship between the two peoples was hardly that of equals. It had a colonial quality not unlike that along much of the American border with Mexico. But when the guy repairing your balcony did not show up for work because of a closure of the West Bank and could not earn his pay, his deprivation meant something to you, as an Israeli. You knew him; you trusted him; you knew about his family. And when you, a Palestinian worker, saw your Israeli employer\u2019s mother growing ill, you understood his anguish. You knew the woman; you liked her. When the Oslo peace process fell apart in 2000 and a Palestinian uprising erupted, the common wisdom that quickly developed was that the two nations needed not greater intimacy but complete separation. Israel built a barrier, barred most Palestinians from entering (replacing them with Asians on temporary visas) and made it illegal for Israeli citizens to enter Palestinian cities. At the same time, a movement took hold among Palestinians aimed at cutting off contact with Israelis. This has grown into what is known as boycott, divestment and sanctions, or B.D.S., which seeks to isolate Israel internationally. Meanwhile, the growth of Arab satellite television channels \u2014 Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya and the Lebanese Hezbollah station Al Manar \u2014 led Palestinians to stop watching Israeli TV and to identify increasingly with the broader Arab and Muslim worlds. Today in Gaza almost no one watches Israeli television and the only people who know Hebrew or know any Israelis as human beings are over 40. Moreover, the growth of the global digital economy has allowed Israel to build an economy largely separate from the nations around it. Trade with its neighbors is insignificant; it is essentially a thriving European-level economy surrounded by poverty. Israelis \u2014 especially in the heartland around Tel Aviv, where two-thirds of the country lives \u2014 can now go weeks without laying eyes on a Palestinian or ever having to think about one. In Gaza, Israelis do not exist except in a kind of collective nightmare. In the West Bank, the Israelis are mostly settlers and soldiers. Apart from a few pockets of industry and shopping where Palestinians are employed, interaction is highly limited.At the height of the peace efforts, in the 1990s, Israeli and Palestinian leaders, locked in rooms negotiating with one another, built a poignant bond and developed a form of trust that they then sought to spread \u2014 not always successfully \u2014 to their peoples. Yossi Beilin, then an Israeli official, and Mahmoud Abbas, who went on to become the president of the Palestinian Authority, wrote a peace plan together. In the early 2000s, Sari Nusseibeh, a Palestinian official and intellectual, joined with Ami Ayalon, a former head of the Israeli Shin Bet security services, and gathered hundreds of thousands of Palestinian and Israeli signatures for a two-state solution. They traveled together for months. They got along famously. The relationship between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas is one of mutual loathing, according to Martin S. Indyk, who resigned last month as American envoy for peace negotiations after nine months of futile efforts. The two sides and their leaders have become total strangers. Each vilifies the other and imagines its own people to be morally superior, forced to defend itself against the cruel predations of the other. A generation ago, there were plenty of causes for tension and concern. But Palestinians building what they hoped would become their state, and Israelis working with them, had an often moving sense of shared purpose. Some discovered that they liked one another and looked forward to working together. Today, those feelings are virtually dead. And while mixing the populations in those years was no panacea, divorcing them has only made things worse. Deputy national editor of The New York Times and a former Jerusalem bureau chief.

{"Headline": "For Biggest Cities of 2030, Look Toward the Tropics", "Date": "2014-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsREALLY big cities used to be primarily in rich countries. But as the world has urbanized, that has changed.The United Nations this week released its estimates of population in the largest cities \u2014 or \u201curban agglomerations\u201d as the organization calls them because the areas do not necessarily conform to city boundaries \u2014 and found that just eight of the 30 largest cities were in countries that the World Bank defines as high income.That compares with 20 of the top 30 in 1950, the first year for which the United Nations has data. By 2030, the organization projected, only four of the 30 largest cities will be in nations now viewed as high income. Those are Tokyo and Osaka in Japan and New York and Los Angeles in the United States. Of those, only one, Tokyo, will be in the Top 10. That area, which now has 37.8 million people, is expected to remain the world\u2019s largest, but to decline to 37.2 million by then.\u201cMany countries are urbanizing at lower levels of development\u201d than in the past, said John R. Wilmoth, the director of the population division of the United Nations. As people leave the countryside because of decreasing need for agricultural workers, he said, the important question will be whether cities have an industrial economy that can provide jobs and an infrastructure that can allow the new residents to live in acceptable conditions.He said that it was easier and less expensive to provide such services as housing, health care, education, electricity and clean water to urban residents than to a similar number of people living in rural areas. But, noting the slums surrounding some cities in poor countries, he added that it was much more difficult to accomplish that after those slums grow.\u201cIt is much better if the planning takes place before they arrive,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, this report is something of a wake-up call.\u201dNew York, which in 1950 was the largest urban area in the world, with 12.3 million residents, now has 18.6 million but ranks only ninth. In 1950, New York and Tokyo, with 11.3 million people, were the only areas with more than 10 million people. Now, there are 28 such areas, many of them in developing countries. Two of them \u2014 Dhaka in Bangladesh and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 are in countries that the World Bank considers to be low income, meaning that the country\u2019s gross national product is less than $1,046 per person. Eight more are in countries with per capita figures under $4,126, making them lower-middle income according to the World Bank. Those eight include three from India and one each from Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines.As recently as 1980, areas with more than a million people accounted for 13 percent of the world\u2019s population. Now, the figure is 22 percent, and the United Nations forecasts that will rise to 27 percent by 2030.The increasing urbanization has meant that a greater proportion of those living in large urban agglomerations are in the tropics, including 11 of the 30 largest areas in the world. Of the 1.5 billion people who now live in areas with at least one million people, 35 percent are in the tropics \u2014 defined as being between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. In 1970, when only 406 million people were concentrated in areas with more than a million people, just one-fifth of them were in the tropics.That calculation does not count S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, the fifth largest urban area in the world, as being in the tropics, because its center is just south of the Tropic of Capricorn. But much of the population of the region lies north of the line, and the Brazilian government classifies the region as tropical. If S\u00e3o Paulo were counted as tropical, the tropical share this year would rise to 36 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Post-Post-Apocalyptic Detroit", "Date": "2014-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn downtown Detroit, at the headquarters of the online-mortgage company Quicken Loans, there stands another downtown Detroit in miniature. The diorama, made of laser-cut acrylic and stretching out over 19 feet in length, is a riot of color and light: Every structure belonging to Quicken\u2019s billionaire owner, Dan Gilbert, is topped in orange and illuminated from within, and Gilbert currently owns 60 of them, a lordly nine million square feet of real estate in all. He began picking up skyscrapers just three and a half years ago, one after another, paying as little as $8 a square foot. He bought five buildings surrounding Capitol Park, the seat of government when Michigan became a state in 1837. He snapped up the site of the old Hudson\u2019s department store, where 12,000 employees catered to 100,000 customers daily in the 1950s. Many of Gilbert\u2019s purchases are 20th-century architectural treasures, built when Detroit served as a hub of world industry. He bought a Daniel Burnham, a few Albert Kahns, a Minoru Yamasaki masterwork with a soaring glass atrium. \u201cThey\u2019re like old-school sports cars,\u201d said Dan Mullen, one of the executives who took over Quicken\u2019s newly formed real estate arm. \u201cThese were buildings with so much character, so much history. They don\u2019t exist anywhere else. And it was like, \u2018Buy this parking garage, and we\u2019ll throw in a skyscraper with it.\u2019 \u201dOne of Gilbert\u2019s new downtown properties is an iconic Kahn creation from 1959 called Chase Tower, previously the National Bank of Detroit Building, which spans a full city block. Now nicknamed the Qube, the building houses hundreds of Quicken loan officers who sit or stand at small desks, working their phones. Employees are encouraged to write on the walls, which also display the latest tallied results in competitions between internal sales teams. Stenciled on the walls as well are the Quicken credos, 19 bits of pithy wisdom the company calls its \u201cIsms.\u201d (\u201cThe inches we need are everywhere around us.\u201d \u201cNumbers and money follow; they do not lead.\u201d) Above the workers hover decorative, spacecraft-like orbs, in peach and pink and aquamarine, matching the colors of the cabinetry and carpeting. The overall atmosphere resembles \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d as art-directed by Dr. Seuss. When a loan officer closes a deal, the resulting mortgage contract is printed out in the nearby basement of the old Federal Reserve, another Gilbert holding. In rooms where armored cars once deposited bags of money, rows of printers run hot, spitting out tens of thousands of contracts a month, a total of $80 billion in residential mortgages last year.Gilbert, 52, is a fist of a man, small and compact, with a cubed jaw, narrow eyes and lips, his hair raked back in a mold. In person, he is affable and reflective \u2014 sensible, even, in his unequivocal fervor for Detroit. He was born in the city, and although his family moved to the suburbs when he was still a toddler, his father continued to operate a bar in Detroit and his grandfather ran a couple of carwashes.At 9, Gilbert started buying candy and reselling it at a profit to his friends. As a teenager in suburban Detroit, he delivered pizzas he made himself. He spent a night in jail while at Michigan State for running a sports book, with the police handing him Egg McMuffins through the bars in the morning. (The charge was later dropped.) After starting his first company, Rock Financial, he fell under the sway of the Thomas J. Peters business tome \u201cIn Search of Excellence\u201d and became fixated on the idea of creating a positive corporate culture. He turned Rock into a web-based mortgage company, which in 1999 was bought out by the software behemoth Intuit and renamed Quicken Loans. Three years later, Gilbert bought back his company but kept its new name. Quicken Loans is estimated to pull in more than $1 billion in revenues each year, and Gilbert is No. 408 on Forbes\u2019s list of the world\u2019s richest people.Gilbert has a tendency to analogize, often plucking his comparisons from the worlds of gambling (he owns four casinos, including Detroit\u2019s Greektown Casino-Hotel) or sports (he also owns the N.B.A.'s Cleveland Cavaliers). Detroit is his mission; he has gone all-in. He has brought 12,500 employees with him to downtown, and along with other private investors is funding the construction of a light-rail system that will connect the central business district with the neighboring Midtown district. Through his umbrella company, Rock Ventures, he formed a start-up incubator called Bizdom and a venture-capital firm, with some of the funded companies already expanding into other Gilbert-owned office space. He told me: \u201cHere, man, oh, man, it\u2019s a dream. Anything can be created in Detroit. Down here, like in basketball, you can create your own shot.\u201d Investing in Detroit, he said, wasn\u2019t like sitting at a roulette table and hoping it landed on 7. He was affecting the outcome \u2014 in a positive way, he hoped. He held to a maxim that you could \u201cdo well by doing good.\u201d He could enrich a city and himself at the same time.Gilbert believes in Detroit, not just as a partisan local booster but in his bones as a businessman. And his belief has a perverse sort of economic logic undergirding it. At the start of the 1950s, the Big Three car companies began to leave the city, seeking lower taxes and lower wages and brand-new corporate campuses elsewhere, and they whittled their work forces through automation. Most retail and other manufacturing jobs and almost all of the white residents followed suit, fleeing en masse to the suburbs or to other places entirely. In the half-century since, the city\u2019s population has sunk to 700,000 from a peak of close to two million, and almost a third of its vast housing stock sits vacant. But this means that property costs have dropped to the point that barriers to ownership \u2014 to a sort of mogulhood, even \u2014 are absurdly low. Some of the city\u2019s competitive advantages remain, including a world-class transportation network of roads and rail and waterways, with almost half of U.S. imports from Canada passing through. Even Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy filing in December (making it the largest American city ever to take such a step) has its upsides. For everyone other than the city\u2019s 32,000 pensioners and 100,000 creditors, the default should make Detroit less dysfunctional and more attractive. And in downtown, at least, Gilbert\u2019s campaign seems to be paying dividends: Occupancy in residential real estate has climbed to 99 percent, and office vacancies are at 11 percent, the lowest rate in decades.The belief in Detroit\u2019s imminent revival has spread far beyond Dan Gilbert and the skyscrapers of downtown. Out in the neighborhoods, there is a legion of mini-Gilberts, longtime Detroiters and recent transplants alike, who have united around a conviction that the city has fallen as far as it can go \u2014 that the time to buy in is at hand. Just a couple of years after Detroit slid into what the national news media incessantly called a \u201cpost-apocalyptic\u201d collapse, the city now teems with a post-post-apocalyptic optimism. When I visited this spring, Quicken Loans had a new slogan emblazoning its downtown office towers and company shuttles, and everyone I spoke with outside the city center seemed to be uttering it like a mantra: OPPORTUNITY DETROIT.In the process, the Motor City has become the testing ground for an updated American dream: privateers finding the raw material for new enterprise in the wreckage of the Rust Belt. Whether or not they\u2019re expecting to profit, Gilbert and other capitalists \u2014 large and small \u2014 are trying to rebuild the city, even stepping in and picking up some duties that were once handled by the public sector. Shop owners around the city are cleaning up the blighted storefronts and public spaces around them. Only 35,000 of Detroit\u2019s 88,000 streetlights actually work, so some owners are buying and installing their own. In Gilbert\u2019s downtown, a Rock Ventures security force patrols the city center 24 hours a day, monitoring 300 surveillance cameras from a control center. Gilbert is proposing to pay $50 million for the land beneath the county courthouse and a partly built jail near his center-city casino, with the intention of moving the municipal buildings to a far-off neighborhood; his goal is to clear the way for an entertainment district that flows south, without interruption, from the sports arenas past his casino and into downtown. Detroit\u2019s new mayor, Mike Duggan, told me he had no problem with the private sector doing so much to shape his city: Other metropolises had their entrepreneurs and deep-pocketed magnates who built and bought and financed things. With a state-appointed emergency manager overseeing various aspects of Detroit\u2019s operations, with many civic services inoperable for years and with a dire need for investment, Duggan said he felt lucky that his town was getting its turn.There are no real assurances that gains will be spread democratically across the city, or that city planning and public resources will serve the needs of everyday Detroiters. But the hope is that private individuals will keep the greater good in mind. Heaster Wheeler, the assistant chief executive of Wayne County and former executive director of the Detroit branch of the N.A.A.C.P., the nation\u2019s largest chapter, sent me a list of Detroit real estate investors who were committed to reviving the neighborhoods through their work. \u201cBlack Dan Gilberts,\u201d he called them. Since 2000, Wayne County has held one of the world\u2019s largest real estate auctions, offering about 20,000 properties a year that were acquired through foreclosure \u2014 some 5 percent of Detroit\u2019s housing stock. Last year, 2,300 bidders took possession of 10,500 of these properties, with a dozen buyers each scooping up more than 100 houses. Some speculators have sat on the inexpensive homes, leaving them vacant as they await a recovery. Wheeler was talking about other buyers who have repaired the houses and rented them out, creating an income stream while adding a layer of stability to tottering sections of the city. African-Americans make up 83 percent of Detroiters, but from 2000 to 2010 their numbers fell by a quarter. \u201cThe city\u2019s true heroes, its real saviors,\u201d he told me, \u201cwere the African-Americans who had a choice to leave Detroit, who had the means, yet stayed. In spite of the public debacles, the racial insensitivities, the public transportation that goes nowhere, the taxes up the wazoo, the unfair auto-insurance costs, they still committed to making Detroit home.\u201dEarly on a weekday morning, Gary Alexander and Siegel Clore, a pair of investors from Wheeler\u2019s list, drove me around the blocks of northeast Detroit where they have accumulated scores of homes. Alexander, 45, and Clore, 43, met in high school and still live in the houses where they grew up. The Alexanders were the second black family on their block in the Aviation Subdivision, near the city\u2019s boundary with Dearborn. \u201cThen one day, I looked up, and every white person was gone,\u201d Alexander said. Clore was raised in Conant Gardens, one of the city\u2019s first middle-class black neighborhoods, where the blocks are now gaptoothed with abandoned property. The house next to his, what he still thinks of as Mr. Edward\u2019s house \u2014 named after a World War II veteran who had lived there \u2014 he bought for $800 and uses as storage. A decade ago, Alexander and Clore started buying real estate together, but that was right before the housing bust. \u201cWe took some hard knocks,\u201d said Clore, who is tall and placid; Alexander is shorter, stockier and more excitable. In 2009, after Clore was laid off by Merrill Lynch, they persuaded relatives and friends to invest in their venture and began combing the thousands of properties in that year\u2019s county auction. They looked for bungalows in middling neighborhoods near the border with the suburbs. They bought 15 houses at the auction for a total of $60,000. Seven of them rented immediately. The next year, they acquired 21 more, at an average of $3,000 apiece.Clore and Alexander now own 70 houses, 50 of them leased and 20 undergoing renovations. Alexander wakes at 4:30 most mornings, so he can spend an hour or so reading before the tumble of phone calls begins: the hot water that is not hot, the contractor who needs supplies. The men described the exhilaration of not only turning a profit but also owning a part of Detroit, their city, and housing other Detroiters. They wanted me to understand that the work they did was personal. Cruising around these blocks, they felt a responsibility. \u201cWe want to have an impact on the community, by putting money into it, repairing it, not sticking on a Band-Aid,\u201d Clore said. His father was an engineer who worked a lifetime in the boiler rooms of Detroit public schools, but the women in his family were all educators. Clore started a nonprofit organization in a local middle school, a program combining golf and math that he hoped would spread. He and Alexander also want to start a business incubator for African-American entrepreneurs, similar to what Dan Gilbert was doing downtown. \u201cA black Bizdom,\u201d Alexander explained.The two prefer buying houses that are occupied, because scavengers often tear everything sellable out of the unoccupied ones. When scouting, they ring doorbells and talk to tenants, many of whom have been duped into paying rent to someone who doesn\u2019t even own the foreclosed property. Squatters sometimes curse them, and they see many signs in windows and on doors that are meant to scare off investors: \u201cHouse Full of Bedbugs\u201d or \u201cIf You Buy This House, I Will Burn It Down.\u201d Because both men worked as appraisers, they know how to estimate a house\u2019s value and the cost of repairs. They might get $750 a month in rent from a woman who worked in retail or from someone paying with a federal Section 8 housing voucher; to make money in this business, they calculated, they would have to buy and renovate each property for a total of $15,000. They ask about leaks in the basement that could suggest problems with the foundation. As they eyeball a roof for damage, they ask if the furnace works or if it\u2019s there at all.The two of them took me inside a few properties that were still being readied for tenants. They generally painted, fixed broken windows, replaced the kitchen countertops and toilets, buffed the wood floors and laid new carpet. The workers they hire are often as transitional as the neighborhoods, so they let the men stay in the houses until they\u2019re rented. Clore and Alexander have become authorities on the vicissitudes of blight, both in its broader boundaries and in the arbitrary shifts it can take from block to block. They try to fix up the abandoned properties next to their houses. They paint boarded-up windows white, mow lawns, pick up debris. People sometimes call to ask if a rental property is in Detroit and hang up when they hear the answer. But Alexander said many of their tenants were native Detroiters moving back to the city now that rents were on the rise again in the suburbs. They spoke with nervous excitement about plans to add to their portfolio of homes and even to buy multifamily buildings. Clore plays golf competitively, a 2 handicap, and on the links he sometimes networks with local business types who say they want to invest in his growing business. He and Alexander already manage an additional 50 rentals for out-of-state owners who acquired the properties at auction. If credit eventually eases, they said, they will begin selling off some of their holdings, turning a profit that way. The Case-Shiller index puts home prices in Detroit up 15 percent from the same point last year, although prices are still paltry compared with those of just about every other city in the country. As we talked, Gary slowed to a crawl in front of a home they bought in 2011. Both of its tenants worked, one at Quicken Loans, in the Qube building. The modest two-flat sold in 2006 for $90,000, but they would double their investment if they could get the renters to buy it for just $30,000. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cShe works as a mortgage processor at Quicken, and she can\u2019t get a mortgage.\u201dAlong a commercial stretch of Livernois Avenue, which in better days earned the name Avenue of Fashion, the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation enabled 10 entrepreneurs to start pop-up businesses last September, matching each of them with artists who designed the temporary spaces. The stores opened all at once, in an effort to create a retail destination with spillover traffic. About 3,000 people attended the Livernois opening festivities, in the rain. In a city with an outsize underdog pride, residents seem desperate to participate in the rituals of revival. At 40, April Anderson quit a human-services job to open a bakery called Good Cakes and Bakes with her wife, using a $10,000 grant from a nonprofit organization called Revolve Detroit. It, along with several other of the pop-ups, has since become permanent. Another new store owner on the block, Chad Dickinson, moved here from Nashville, where he built music studios, because he read that 20-somethings were among the fastest-growing groups in Detroit. He bought a historic Tudor near Livernois for what seemed like a steal and started a furniture business. Wearing a throwback Tigers cap over his long blond hair, he told me that he purchased (\u201cfor dirt cheap\u201d) and was rehabbing the shuttered Hunter\u2019s Supper Club, the center of the Avenue of Fashion in its heyday.Rufus Bartell, who was sometimes called the Avenue of Fashion\u2019s mayor and even its Dan Gilbert, owns a corner clothing store there. \u201cSimply Casual is a lifestyle store catering to people who work hard and play hard and making their transition between the two smooth,\u201d he told me. At 49, Bartell, wearing an ascot and sleek Puma sneakers, made it plain that he was a man who wouldn\u2019t be outworked or outplayed. Like just about everything in Detroit, his store is a former something \u2014 Grinnell Brothers pianos, back when the wives of auto executives strolled the avenue\u2019s high-end shops, and later a cleaners. He believed that the once-thrumming Motor City was more a land of opportunity today than it was at any moment in his lifetime. For the first time in eight years, sales at his store were picking up. With his nephew, a recently retired N.F.L. cornerback, Bartell is also opening a chicken-and-waffle restaurant on the Avenue of Fashion. And alone or with other partners, he has bought five vacant storefronts there, some 40,000 square feet. He is confident that he can fill it all with retail.Bartell always juggles a number of enterprises, he told me, purposefully keeping his portfolio diverse. He has also involved himself in the larger enterprise of civic development. \u201cThat\u2019s how you graduate from being a business owner to a business leader, and it\u2019s why I admire Dan Gilbert,\u201d he said. Bartell serves on the advisory boards of Detroit Future City, the Michigan Garment Council and a nonprofit organization that funds Detroiters who plan to open unique shops in their communities. On Livernois, he said, four new restaurants and six more stores are preparing to open in the next year or so, and the entire strip has the support of the nonprofit groups and their grant money. Just last month, after six years of considering it, he and a handful of other business owners paid for a billboard on the northern end of the corridor, advertising the revived Avenue of Fashion as a place to \u201cShop. Dine. Explore.\u201d Most of all, Bartell feels confident that the pendulum has already begun to swing in Detroit\u2019s favor. Along his half-mile of Livernois, there are 51 retailers doing $47.6 million in annual sales. The median household income in the surrounding residential blocks is $56,000, among the highest in the city. Although most of sparsely populated Detroit is seeing very little economic activity or likelihood of any to come, there are a half-dozen retail corridors like the Avenue of Fashion in the city. The business resource center D-Hive has graduated 350 Detroiters from its small-business classes in the last two years and has 100 people on its waiting list for coming sessions. According to the National League of Cities, Detroit was the fifth-ranked city in the U.S. in 2012 in terms of jobs per capita from start-ups, beating out San Jose, Calif. \u201cDetroit is getting ready to hit momentum,\u201d Bartell told me. \u201cWhen you hit momentum, companies go from small to big.\u201dBartell is an unrelenting proponent of the free market, and as he ran the weekly meeting of the Independent Business Association in one of his empty storefronts on a weekday morning, he kept the focus on the moneymaking possibilities in his city\u2019s demise. Of the 20 small-business owners there, all but two of them were African-American. A retired civil engineer named Prema Qadir, who built websites and was looking to start a catering service, complained about the failure of city government to properly educate anyone. Bartell cut her short: \u201cThat sounds like an opportunity. Pose it in the form of an opportunity.\u201d Someone else worried over the fate of Detroiters who have stuck it out in homes while all around them their neighborhoods turned to field and ash. \u201cTo grow Detroit,\u201d Bartell pronounced, \u201cyou have to shrink it. There are opportunities with vacant land.\u201d Buildings were going to be torn down, junk hauled off, land cleared. Those were all potential businesses. \u201cIf it was my grandmother living on a street with one house, \u2018Sorry, Grandma, you got to move.\u2019 \u201dFrom behind Bartell, a woman who was shifting uncomfortably could no longer hold her tongue. She shouted, \u201cI totally disagree, Rufus.\u201d\u201cOf course you do. Socialist,\u201d Bartell muttered.The woman, Tenay Hankins, runs Biz to Biz Match, a service assisting small businesses with grants, contracts and partnerships. She and a couple of other women reminded those gathered that the city had a terrible track record of looking out for its residents, and that Detroiters, particularly blacks, had been ill served by state and local government, redlining lenders and high-rolling private investors. Just recently, blind faith in capitalism buried their neighborhoods under foreclosures and contributed heavily to the city\u2019s bankruptcy. \u201cDetroiters are not respected as far as the value and dollars they bring, the obstacles they\u2019ve overcome to still be here. It\u2019s always looked at as if we\u2019re not instrumental,\u201d Hankins said.\u201cThe question is, what do you do after your skepticism,\u201d Bartell responded, trying to get his meeting back on track. \u201cEvery city on the globe, there are things that government hasn\u2019t done correctly. You got to have a plan. Detroit is being rebuilt with or without everybody at this table.\u201dThis stretch of Corktown is still framed by the colossal ruins of Michigan Central Station, which, like the abandoned Packard plant on East Grand Boulevard, looms as an Acropolis to our dead industrial empire. A few years ago, Cooley and others began clearing the knee-high grass and weeds in front of the relic, believing that the area needed a \u201cGreek agora,\u201d a place where neighbors could be innovative together. He showed me the land beside the rail station where he and 44 students he was mentoring were opening a sushi restaurant that would operate out of shipping containers. Available housing is now scarce in Corktown, but Cooley had just bought a decommissioned firehouse nearby, and he and his fianc\u00e9e, Kate Bordine, planned to live there and run some sort of business out of part of it. Around the corner, Bordine and two other women are starting a vodka distillery.Next to Slows, Cooley helped two friends open Astro Coffee, building the milk station and some furniture for them. As I walked with him past the cafe, he stopped to embrace an organic farmer who was eating couscous from a bowl as he read The New Yorker. Like Cooley, the farmer was white, willowy and bearded, and he wore a look-alike checked flannel shirt. A small Ford pulled up, and its driver jumped out. \u201cIs it too crazy to do a Facebook event at Ponyride tomorrow night?\u201d the man shouted to Cooley from the middle of the street.\u201cFor how many?\u201d Cooley yelled back.\u201cA hundred.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d\u201cAwesome.\u201d\u201cSweet. Thanks, buddy.\u201dPonyride is Cooley\u2019s version of an incubator: a small-business collective in a 30,000-square-foot warehouse he bought for just $100,000 in 2011. Across the street, Dan Gilbert acquired two lots and is busily building a giant Quicken Loans data center and office complex. Despite the abundance of vacant commercial space in the city, very little of it is actually ready for occupancy, with adequate walls and floors and electrical systems. So Ponyride, operating at a small loss, offers work space to 25 small companies starting at 20 cents per square foot. It also has co-working rooms, which house another 25 small businesses. The tenants include a coffee shop, a dance studio, electrical and plumbing contractors, a blacksmith and woodworkers, two brothers who hot-press T-shirts and a blueprint business, which downsized after the collapse of the housing market. In the partitioned room of Ponyride that belongs to the Detroit Denim Company, which produces 100 pairs of bespoke jeans a month, the owner drew designs on a whiteboard while an employee cut material.The largest tenant by far is the Empowerment Plan, a manufacturer of jackets that convert into sleeping bags for the homeless. Veronika Scott started the nonprofit in 2011, when she was a 21-year-old recent graduate of the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, and she now fills 6,000 orders a year. Gilbert wrote her a check for $250,000 when he visited Ponyride. Seven young African-American women sat at sewing machines, while all around them, black bags with the finished jackets were piled high. Scott acknowledged that she might soon become too large for her space there, but she said the growing number of small companies and light-industrial start-ups in Detroit had created a demand for additional Ponyrides. She planned to go elsewhere in the city, probably to a neighborhood that hadn\u2019t yet seen as much gentrification. Like Cooley, she wants to become an anchor for her own manufacturing cooperative.Paffendorf has personally created eight such jobs through Loveland Technologies, a company he co-founded in 2009. But in Loveland, he has also provided an invaluable resource for the city\u2019s new prospector class as a whole. Its product is a data-rich online map that offers public information on ownership, zoning and tax assessments for every single parcel of land in the city; for a fee, organizations and developers get a premium version that they can build upon and share. Siegel Clore and Gary Alexander said they sometimes consulted Loveland\u2019s listings for properties under tax distress and at risk of foreclosure, studying which ones were up for auction and tracking what other investors were buying.Soon after moving, Paffendorf started to play around in real estate, something you can do in Detroit; he bought an empty lot at auction for $500 and then sold parts of it online, with buyers paying $1 for an inch of the property and watching their holdings on a FarmVille-like map. Another year, he and some friends from the environmental nonprofit organization Ecoworks bought 10 houses to collect data on deconstruction: permit times, labor costs, the resale value of the mined materials. If Detroit was going to try to knock down anywhere near its 80,000 blighted properties, if there was going to be a marketplace for piece-by-piece deconstruction, the city needed to know more about the alternatives to throwing all the waste in a landfill.Through these experiments, Paffendorf realized that Detroit suffered from what might be called an information crisis. City departments were sometimes unable to figure out who owned a property or what improvements to it were needed. The Fire Department couldn\u2019t quickly look up whether a burning building was unoccupied or condemned. The lack of good information was standing in the way of rational decision-making. When problems could be mapped, Paffendorf believed, they came to seem less hopeless, more explainable, more fixable. Hence the idea behind Loveland.A rangy 6-foot-7, Paffendorf has the wide-eyed open face of a child actor. The GMC Yukon he drove me around in had been broken into several times in the last couple of years, the latest aborted attempt visible in the red and black wires poking out of his steering column like weeds. \u201cOverfished this pond,\u201d he said cheerily. He took me to Detroit\u2019s east side, just beyond the shops and open-air stalls of Eastern Market, where for long stretches you can drink in the unfathomable dissolution of a built landscape. It looked fantastical, like the fallout from an alien invasion. Amid the telephone poles that endured and the mounds of timber and brick, discarded tires were stacked like battlements. Every house was burned, battered or disappeared, the buildings laid low like the massacred in a killing field. Along Gratiot Avenue, a grand boulevard as wide as a river and mostly devoid of cars, the lifeless businesses lined the street like the craggy walls of a gorge. Through an overgrown field, a solitary man entered a doorless school. We passed homes that had atrophied, with verandas folded in like a broken-brimmed hat or the entire thing sunken as if made from wax. Other residences had turned Potemkin, their facades relatively intact but their innards and roofs missing. We came across large colonial-style houses cross-sectioned, entire portions of them gone. With an estimated 5,000 arsons in the city each year, we most of all saw houses charred and sooted. But then, unexpectedly, amid the collapse, with no other inhabited structures nearby, we passed the grandma\u2019s house Rufus Bartell adjudged: a single bungalow, its shutters and ornate metal security door painted bright pink, the manicured lawn topped with a bird pond and stone swans, the hedges shaped into perfect loaves.With Dan Gilbert and others funding the effort, Loveland and another group called Data Driven Detroit managed a group of 150 Detroiters. Fifty of them were drivers, employee volunteers from Quicken Loans; the other 100 were surveyors, who earned $10 an hour. Over two months last winter, the Motor City Mapping teams logged details on the condition of each of the 380,000 parcels in the city, putting all the data online. Paffendorf pulled over to show me how it works. We were on the corner of Elba Place and Mt. Elliott Street, alongside what remained of the Heidelberg Project, an outdoor art installation begun in 1986 by a local resident, Tyree Guyton. Starting one block over, on Heidelberg Street, ramshackle houses were painted with brightly colored polka dots and numbers and adorned with dolls and other found objects. The project is a one-man assault on blight, a demonstration that beauty and creativity also happen there. Paffendorf\u2019s records showed that 3423 Mt. Elliott was built in 1918 and last sold in 2005 for $11,000. It was the \u201cParty Animal House,\u201d a building ornamented with stuffed animals. But someone had burned it to its brick base. In the last year, six of the 10 Heidelberg Project houses were set on fire. On a tablet, Paffendorf punched in the answers to survey questions, what they called \u201cblexting,\u201d texting a photograph and other information about blight back to their shareable database, where it was checked against other sources and stored.\u201cIs the property occupied?\u201d Clearly no.\u201cWhat is the condition of the structure: good, fair or poor?\u201d Poor.\u201cWould you suggest demolition?\u201d No need; it had already been taken care of.Yet even amid the rehabbed Beaux-Arts and Modernist towers, hardly a sightline doesn\u2019t land on a building gone to seed. Next to a cafe, on the clapboards covering what 60 years earlier was one of the country\u2019s most prominent instrument stores, an artist has painted a grim joke: \u201cFree Coffee With Purchase of Wurlitzer Bldg.\u201d Citywide, a third of Detroit\u2019s remaining residents say they still plan to leave in the next five years. And why not? In a city with the second-highest violent-crime rate in the country and an average of 14 arsons a day, the police and firefighters often don\u2019t arrive when called. Just two years ago, one in three households lived in poverty, a jump of 40 percent in just the last decade. There was only one private-sector job for every four Detroiters, and only half the working-age population was employed. Of the employed, three-fifths commuted to jobs outside the city. A mere 70,700 people both lived and worked inside Detroit.This is the environment that allows for cheap real estate and easy accessibility. But sometimes a wreck is just a wreck; some goods are not a bargain at any price. The risk to Detroit\u2019s new buyers is that they haven\u2019t bought low enough. The 2012 master plan imagined a city in which the population stabilized at roughly 600,000, with half the overabundant land reclaimed as parks and mixed-green communities, a flowering of carbon-reducing forests and industrial buffers, of greenways and retention ponds, of campgrounds and community gardens. Another Detroit-area tycoon, John Hantz, has taken a real step toward this vision by clearing 150 acres for tree farms, planting 15,000 hardwoods \u2014 sugar maples, white birch, oak and bur oak. But that future city isn\u2019t here yet, and neither are any of the Detroits dreamed up by Dan Gilbert, or Rufus Bartell, or the city\u2019s other optimists. When Mayor Duggan told me in April that his entire focus was on increasing the city\u2019s population, he said that each month he planned to demolish 600 blighted properties and install 2,400 functioning streetlights. \u201cAnd if you give me some time,\u201d he said, \u201cthe police are going to show up on time. And ultimately, we\u2019re going to solve the problem of the schools.\u201dWhile wandering around downtown, I dropped into a coffee shop, the Urban Bean Company, to ask for directions. It is in a narrow wedge of a building opposite Capitol Park. It sells locally sourced coffee and food; upstairs, amid a sliver of seats, patrons can spin electronic-music records on a turntable. Save for the two owners, though, the place was empty. Ed Siegel sat with his elbows on the counter. He told me he had worked at a New York office of Moody\u2019s, in commercial mortgage-backed securities. Two years ago, he visited Detroit and drove the length of Woodward Avenue, from downtown to 8 Mile Road. He was so sure he was seeing a city poised for rebound that he moved permanently. His partner in the venture, Josh Greenwood, who left a Chrysler truck-assembly plant after a decade on the line, leaned against a wall with his eyes closed, nursing a sore back. He opened the coffee shop initially in 2000, thinking the area was already on the mend, but he had to shut it down during the mortgage-foreclosure mess. Last year, with all Gilbert was planning for Capitol Park \u2014 \u201cdowntown\u2019s hidden jewel,\u201d Rock Ventures branded it \u2014 he figured it was time to start again.But even there, just two blocks from Gilbert\u2019s Qube, the revival has yet to arrive. The park\u2019s small triangle of grass is still cramped with homeless people and surrounded by walls covered in graffiti. Empty buildings are everywhere. Across the street from Urban Bean, a fire had recently transformed a strip club called the Grind into a blackened husk. The countless small businesses, the swarm of nonprofit groups and pop-up retail, the transplanted young techies and artists, the widespread investment in real estate snatched up at thrift-store prices \u2014 for all of that, the new Detroit remains more an idea on paper than a coalescing future. Dan Gilbert has faith: This spring, he bought eight more properties. But he has plenty of money to lose on his conviction, whereas Greenwood and Siegel do not. They got in on what looked like the ground floor, and now they are praying that it truly was the bottom.\u201cSitting here, waiting, it\u2019s the hardest part,\u201d Siegel said, twitching with nervous laughter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Ex-Leader Questioned in Graft Inquiry, Imperiling Comeback Hopes", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France, was detained Tuesday for questioning by French anticorruption investigators, a serious new turn in a blossoming criminal inquiry that threatens his hopes of a political comeback.Mr. Sarkozy, a conservative who was president from 2007 to 2012, has not been charged, but he can be held under French law for up to 48 hours to answer questions from prosecutors. \u00c9liane Houlette, the national prosecutor in charge of financial corruption cases, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Sarkozy, 59, was detained for questioning at 8 a.m. She did not provide further details.In the past, Mr. Sarkozy has denied any wrongdoing and characterized the investigation as politically motivated. An aide to Mr. Sarkozy declined to comment on Tuesday.Depending on what investigators decide, Mr. Sarkozy can be released, be put under formal investigation as a suspect or be made a witness in the case, legal experts said.They are also reportedly investigating whether Mr. Sarkozy, Mr. Herzog and Judge Azibert plotted to reward the judge\u2019s help in the case with a post in Monte Carlo. Mr. Sarkozy was detained a day after investigators questioned Mr. Herzog and two judges, including Judge Azibert.A series of court cases and criminal investigations have followed Mr. Sarkozy since he left office in 2012, and expectations that he could run again for the presidency in 2017 have served to intensify interest in the man once called \u201cPresident Bling-Bling\u201d because of his flamboyant personal style. Global interest in Mr. Sarkozy, who lost his re-election bid two years ago, has also been fanned by his wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy.But Mr. Sarkozy is the first former president in the country\u2019s history to be detained and questioned in police custody.Mr. Sarkozy also appears to be the first former president whose private conversations were monitored by investigators. The case has spurred lurid headlines and called into question whether the tapping of Mr. Herzog\u2019s phone was a breach of attorney-client privilege.The latest twist in the case could be devastating for Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s hopes of a political comeback. And while the scandal has been damaging for Mr. Sarkozy and the right, it has also proved embarrassing for President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialist government, which initially sought to distance itself from the decision to turn to phone-tapping in the case. Government ministers, including the justice minister, Christiane Taubira, later acknowledged that they were informed of the phone-tapping as early as February of this year.Among the accusations against Mr. Sarkozy is that in 2007 his presidential campaign received up to \u20ac50 million, or about $68 million, in illegal funds from Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader.Mr. Sarkozy has consistently denied any allegations of impropriety, and compared those who tapped his phones to the Stasi, the secret police in East Germany. He has said he received no financial support from Libya and has insisted that the accusations \u2014 made by former allies of Colonel Qaddafi and his sons \u2014 are politically motivated and derive from his role in orchestrating the international military intervention in Libya in 2011 that ultimately led to Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s ouster.Suspicions have also focused on Judge Azibert, who prosecutors suspect may have fed information to Mr. Sarkozy on the direction of the judicial proceedings against him. According to Le Monde, recorded conversations between the men included a discussion of whether Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign received improper donations from Liliane Bettencourt, now 91, the L\u2019Or\u00e9al heiress and the richest woman in France. Evidence in that case has been used in another case in which Mr. Sarkozy has come under suspicion with regard to a $550 million government payout in 2008 to Bernard Tapie, a businessman with a murky past.The investigation into breach of judicial secrecy and influence-peddling was opened amid suspicions that Judge Azibert was Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s informant, according to Le Monde and government documents. In return for keeping the former president briefed, the French news media reported, Judge Azibert suggested to Mr. Sarkozy that he would appreciate obtaining a post in Monaco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Coming Democratic Schism", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is a striking generational split in the Democratic electorate.I asked Andrew Kohut, the founding director of the Pew Center, what he made of these results. He emailed me his thoughts: \u201cThere is a libertarian streak that is apparent among these left-of-center young people. Socially liberal but very wary of government. Why? They came of age in an anti-government era when government doesn\u2019t work. They are very liberal on interpersonal racial dimension, but reject classic liberal notions about ways of achieving social progress for minorities.\u201dReturning to the Pew data, even though younger Democrats are less committed to the central tenets of traditional economic liberalism, there is a strong body of evidence suggesting that the partisan commitment these voters made to the Democratic Party when they first came of political age will endure.The two groups were asked to choose whether \u201cmost people can get ahead if they\u2019re willing to work hard\u201d or whether \u201chard work and determination are no guarantee of success for most people.\u201d A decisive majority of the older \u201csolid liberal\u201d group, 67 percent, responded that hard work is no guarantee of success, while an even larger majority, 77 percent, of the younger \u201cnext generation left\u201d believes that you can get ahead if you are willing to work hard.According to Pew, the older group believes, 73-20, that \u201cgovernment should do more to solve problems.\u201d Only 44 percent of the younger group agrees \u2014 and of younger respondents, 50 percent believe that \u201cgovernment is trying to do too much.\u201dEighty-three percent of the older group of Democratic voters believes that \u201ccircumstances\u201d are to blame for poverty; only 9 percent blame \u201ca lack of effort.\u201d The younger group of pro-Democratic voters is split, with 47 percent blaming circumstances and 42 percent blaming lack of effort. An overwhelming majority of the older cohort, 83-12, believes that \u201cgovernment should do more to help needy Americans, even if it means more debt,\u201d while a majority of the younger Democratic respondents, 56-39, believes \u201cgovernment cannot afford to do much more.\u201dA 56 percent majority of the younger group of Democrats believes that \u201cWall Street helps the American economy more than it hurts,\u201d with just 36 percent believing that Wall Street hurts the economy. Older Democrats have almost exactly the opposite view. 56 percent believe that Wall Street hurts the economy; 36 percent believe it helps.One area of major divergence between young and old Democrats is race.Asked by Pew to choose between two statements \u2014 \u201cRacial discrimination is the main reason why many blacks can\u2019t get ahead\u201d and \u201cBlacks who can\u2019t get ahead are mostly responsible for their own condition\u201d \u2013 the older Democratic cohort blamed discrimination, by an 80 to 10 margin. In contrast, only 19 percent of the younger group of Democrats blamed discrimination, with 68 percent saying that blacks \u201care mostly responsible for their own condition.\u201dSome 91 percent of the older group said the \u201cU.S. needs to continue making changes to give blacks equal rights,\u201d and just 6 percent said the \u201cU.S. has made the changes needed to give blacks equal rights.\u201d 67 percent of the younger group said the United States has done enough for blacks, and 28 percent said that the country needs to do more to give blacks equal rights.Even though younger voters lean toward the Democratic Party, they clearly do not fit into traditional left-right categories.Looking again at the Reason poll, the survey found that \u201cwhile millennials see themselves as closer to Republican governor and potential presidential candidate Chris Christie on economic issues, and closer to likely Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on social issues, they say they are voting for Clinton.\u201dWhen asked by Reason if they would consider voting for Clinton, 53 percent of those surveyed said yes, and 27 percent said no. Both Joe Biden, the vice president, and Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, received more yeses than noes.The Reason survey found, on the other hand, that every one of the prospective Republican presidential candidates pollsters mentioned \u2014 Christie, Rand Paul, Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, Jeb Bush and Bobby Jindal \u2014 received more noes than yeses from millennials, by margins ranging from two noes for every yes to four noes for every yes.The young voters in the Reason survey are more pro-business than anti-business, but not by the overwhelming margins of some Republican constituencies. Just over half, 54 percent, believe corporate profits are about right or too low, while 44 percent say corporate profits are too high.By a margin of 70-25, millennials in the Reason survey chose \u201ccompetition is primarily good; it stimulates people to work hard and develop new ideas\u201d over \u201ccompetition is primarily harmful; it brings out the worst in people.\u201d By 64-25, millennials picked \u201cprofit is generally good because it encourages businesses to provide valued products to attract customers\u201d as opposed to \u201cprofit is generally bad because it encourages businesses to take advantage of their customers and employees.\u201dIn some other respects, the millennial voters studied by Reason appear to hold orthodox liberal views: they support more spending to help the poor, even if it means higher taxes; government action to guarantee a living wage, enough for everyone to eat and have a place to sleep; and a government guarantee of health insurance. Conversely, majorities of the same voters believe that wealth should be distributed according to achievement as opposed to need, and that \u201cpeople should be allowed to keep what they produce, even if there are others with greater needs.\u201dStanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, believes that the generational differences within the Democratic Party will not damage the party\u2019s prospects in the short-to-medium term.\u201cYou may have issue differences within the Democratic Party, but they become irrelevant when confronted by a Republican Party determined to turn elections into cultural conflicts,\u201d Greenberg said in a phone interview. \u201cThese differences don\u2019t matter in the context of a Republican party that brings out the commonality of the Democratic Party.\u201dDavid Leege, an emeritus professor of political science at Notre Dame, wrote in an email to The Times that younger Democrats \u201care products of a totally different environment and culture than their grandparents.\u201d As a result, he said, \u201cthere is a vast difference between the communitarianism of the elders and the individualism of the younger liberals.\u201dIn the future, Leege argues, \u201cthe combination of unanchored and individualistic electorates and the post-Citizens United political arena can make elections perpetually close.\u201dMoney, in Leege\u2019s view, will be likely to trump the demographic trends favoring Democrats.Leege raises a fundamental question. The Democratic Party could well gain strength politically as it edges away from economic liberalism to a coalition determined to protect personal liberties from conservative moral constraint.This shift, however, will erode what remains of the opposition to the business community\u2019s efforts to lower tax rates, especially on the affluent; to reduce social spending; and to pare back regulation of the commercial and financial sectors.Corporate America faces a divided Democratic Party, vulnerable to the kind of lobbying pressures that the business elite specializes in. Under this scenario, Wall Street and the Chamber of Commerce will enjoy increased leverage in the policy-making arenas of Congress and the executive branch despite \u2013 or even because \u2013 of Democratic political success.An earlier version of this column misstated the percentage of millennials, who, in the Reason survey, chose the idea that \u201ccompetition is primarily harmful; it brings out the worst in people\u201d over the idea that \u201ccompetition is primarily good; it stimulates people to work hard and develop new ideas\u201d; it is 25, not 35.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Settlers", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a trip to Lusaka, Zambia, last year, I kept chasing an energetic and jittery Chinese man, the only staff member of a Chinese mining company willing to talk to me after his firm had been involved in several scandals in which both Chinese and Zambian employees were either killed or injured on the job. Zambia, with its abundant copper ore deposits, is one of the most important investment destinations for China. His English was excellent, and he liked to talk \u2014 and talk. After telling me about how much he loved the country and its people, he sometimes went into a rant about how Zambian miners liked drinking and money too much, and did not like to work hard. It was that mentality, he continued, that had caused his company all its troubles (not the workplace-safety and low-pay grievances of which it was accused). But even though the Zambian government had repossessed his company\u2019s mines, this man wasn\u2019t leaving. He was now working as an interpreter for the government. I wondered about his family back home, and what they thought of this young man forging his life thousands of miles away. In his extraordinary new book \u201cChina\u2019s Second Continent,\u201d Howard W. French delves into the lives of some of the one million-plus Chinese migrants he says are now building careers in Africa. For all the debate about China\u2019s intentions (imperialist or not?) and business practices (corrupt or not?) on the continent, the key piece of the discussion, French argues, has been ignored: the actual lives of those Chinese who have uprooted themselves to settle and work in Africa. Even as China has become the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy, 10 of the 20 fastest-growing economies between 2013 and 2017 are projected to be in Africa. As French writes, \u201cBit by bit, these facts have become closely intertwined.\u201d The recent Chinese immigrants are the glue holding them together. And the stories French tells are fascinating.French\u2019s characters range from the mundane to the outrageous. In Mozambique he spends time with Hao Shengli, a brash agricultural entrepreneur from Henan province whom he calls the Chinese version of the \u201cugly American.\u201d French, a former New York Times foreign chief in Africa and China, speaks Chinese, pleasantly surprising his subjects with his fluency, and they often allowed him into their homes, businesses and even wedding celebrations. Hao, for instance, is startlingly blunt. The skin of the Mozambicans was so \u201cblack\u201d that it made him uncomfortable at first. He tells French: \u201cI didn\u2019t think they were so clever, not so intelligent, and I was looking for an opportunity based on my own capabilities. Can you imagine if I had gone to America or Germany first? The people in those . . . places are too smart.\u201d He went on, \u201cSo we had to find backward countries, poor countries that we can lead, places where we can do business, where we can manage things successfully.\u201d Still, Hao is not a stand-in for his countrymen across the continent; his story is unique. He distrusts other Chinese businessmen in Mozambique, and so he camped out alone in the countryside, where he bought a swath of land from a local government (angering native residents) to grow lucrative crops, and schemed to hold on to his budding wealth. Hao\u2019s grand plan is to marry off his sons to local women and then put his land in the women\u2019s names for safekeeping from government seizure, creating a miniature Chinese-Mozambican economic dynasty. He moved his two sons from China, and the older one has acquired a live-in girlfriend who cooks and cleans for the men. Hao is one of a number of Chinese farmers targeting empty expanses on the continent; Africa may hold up to 60 percent of the world\u2019s uncultivated arable land.In Senegal\u2019s seaside capital, Dakar, French finds a 26-year-old businesswoman who ended up in West Africa probably as a prostitute (he never asks outright), yet worked her way up into owning a karaoke bar and massage parlor. \u201cDakar in those early days was really boring. Pretty much everything was lacking here, and I thought even a county seat somewhere in China must be more interesting,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when I got back home, there wasn\u2019t much for me to do, so I changed my mind.\u201d When characters like these tell their stories in their own words, \u201cChina\u2019s Second Continent\u201d shines. The book\u2019s pace can drag at times, but French is a clear, thoughtful storyteller.China is now Africa\u2019s largest trading partner, and it offers loans, grants and development deals without the anticorruption strings favored by the United States and Europe. Yet in most of the countries French travels to, Africans complain about inferior Chinese goods and shoddy infrastructure, like the new roads the Chinese have built. I recently hired a Senegalese carpenter to change the lock of an apartment I was renting in Dakar. He explained the different kinds of locks available at the hardware store. \u201cThere are Chinese locks,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I think you should pay more for the best ones.\u201d In later chapters, Africans \u2014 from government, civil society and ancestral communities \u2014 speak about how public officials, engaged in what French calls \u201cgangster capitalism,\u201d are failing to hold Chinese investors accountable. A pervasive lack of transparency has allowed businessmen to export valuable resources like timber illegally, and to bring in an uncapped number of Chinese immigrants (\u201cThere are too many of them in their own country, and they are doing this to decongest China,\u201d a Zambian politician complains). Meanwhile, investors are seizing land at bargain prices and extracting minerals. China says its relationship with Africa is \u201cwin-win.\u201d The problem is, most African leaders, more interested in profiting from their countries\u2019 resources, haven\u2019t committed to letting their people win, too. When I was in Zambia, the government was passing legislation to tax the earnings of its foreign mining investors more efficiently. Whether current officials will be more responsible with that revenue than their predecessors, some of whom allegedly accepted kickbacks worth millions of dollars from Chinese investors, remains to be seen.French concludes that Chinese migration to the continent falls within a wider tradition of foreign powers establishing spheres of economic influence in Africa, and he doesn\u2019t doubt that China\u2019s political demands on Africa will grow. This is probably true. But if Africa fails to capitalize on its wealth to the benefit of future generations, it won\u2019t be entirely China\u2019s fault.

{"Headline": "New Dimension in Scoreboard Watching", "Date": "2014-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTeams like the N.F.L.\u2019s Jacksonville Jaguars have installed huge video displays in an attempt to lure fans away from their big-screen TVs and into stadiums and arenas.BROOKINGS, S.D. \u2014 The seemingly endless prairie that blankets this part of the United States would seem to be an unlikely place for one of the largest makers of sports video displays, Daktronics. After all, the nearest big-league ballpark is a four-hour drive from this town, which has barely enough residents to fill any of the arenas and stadiums where the high-tech screens are fixtures.Yet in the nearly half-century since its founding, the company has become a global giant in sports entertainment, and though the quiet, tree-lined streets may not show it, business is good.Revenue grew by a healthy 6.5 percent last year, largely because of demand from the N.F.L. For months, hundreds of the 1,600 workers in the sprawling Daktronics complex off the interstate that runs between Omaha and Fargo, N.D., have been building gigantic video displays for N.F.L. teams in cities like Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland; and Jacksonville, Fla., where two screens the length of a football field were installed behind the end zones and will be unveiled this week. Smaller screens will end up in the baseball, basketball and hockey homes of professional and college teams.The new orders are a result of a paradox: As teams reap billions of dollars from television networks that carry their games in increasingly vivid detail, fans are finding more reasons to stay home, especially as the costs of tickets, parking and food escalate.So in a twist that would make Marshall McLuhan proud, teams are trying to recreate the living room experience in stadiums. In recent years, they have installed televisions in suites, boosted Wi-Fi and cellphone signals, and created lounges where fans can track their fantasy football teams.They are also installing high-definition video displays made by Daktronics, Mitsubishi Electric and others, providing a sensory punch that can be appreciated only in person.\u201cWe see the living room as our biggest competitor,\u201d said Al Kurtenbach, a Daktronics co-founder and its chairman. \u201cOur job is to help the venue manager with fresh content. We can give fans a reason to stay.\u201dTeams have always tried to draw fans to stadiums. They have hired mascots, given away merchandise, and put on free concerts and fireworks shows. Fans can run the bases, throw out the first pitch and meet players and coaches.The prevailing wisdom among sports executives now is that younger fans raised on smartphones are less willing to attend live events because they are cut off from the online content they find compelling.Giant scoreboards, they hope, will quench that digital addiction while generating new advertising revenue. They can also become attractions like the enormous video screen in the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 stadium, which opened in 2009.James Ricchiuti, who covers Daktronics for the investment bank Needham & Company, said, \u201cThere\u2019s real pressure on teams to do something, because with large-screen televisions in the home, they have to do something to attract fans to come to the arenas and stadiums.\u201d\u2018The Wow Factor\u2019Shahid Khan had that thought in mind. After buying the Jaguars in 2011, he realized that Jacksonville, one of the smallest N.F.L. markets, was a hard place to sell tickets. The team has not made the playoffs since the 2007 season, and college football is wildly popular there. A transient population and a struggling local economy did not help.So Khan cut ticket prices, added club seats and party zones, and refurbished the locker rooms and training rooms. This year, he and the city have spent $63 million to renovate EverBank Field and add two of the world\u2019s largest video displays, made more than 1,500 miles away by Daktronics.Towering over each end zone, the displays are 362 feet long and 60 feet tall \u2014 taller than almost every building in Brookings. Fans will get their first look at them Saturday when Fulham (also owned by Khan), a prominent English team, and D.C. United of Major League Soccer play an exhibition at EverBank Field.\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is upgrading the experience for our fans,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThis is another step in the arms race to get the fans back into the stadium.\u201dThe Cleveland Browns have not had problems selling tickets, but they felt their 15-year-old stadium needed an upgrade. A big piece of their $120 million renovation of FirstEnergy Stadium was the installation of Daktronics displays, which are three times larger than their predecessors.\u201cWe feel like we had to improve the fan experience,\u201d said Alec Scheiner, the Browns\u2019 president. \u201cAnd when we get better on the field, we feel like it will translate into more revenue, too.\u201dKhan has a keen interest in the displays because his main business, Flex-N-Gate, makes auto parts, including headlamps with light-emitting diodes. He visited Daktronics in May to see the displays being made.In a large showroom in a vast warehouse, Khan and the team\u2019s president, Mark Lamping, saw a display 38 feet long by 14 feet tall that was crammed with about 300,000 red, blue and green diodes, each the size of a pinkie fingernail. A 40th of the size of the displays to be installed in Jacksonville, it showed graphics of the Jaguars\u2019 logo in stunning clarity.The density of the pixels correlates closely with the resolution of a display.Pixels were often 16 millimeters apart a few years ago, but they are now often 8 millimeters apart. Daktronics has also designed modules so displays are easier to read outdoors.\u201cThis display technology really punches through the sun,\u201d said Mike Kempany, a sales manager at Daktronics. \u201cThere are other technologies out there, but they don\u2019t give the wow factor that this does.\u201dIn laboratories near the showroom, Khan and Lamping were shown how the displays were tested to ensure they could withstand strong sunlight, downpours and other extreme weather conditions for at least a decade.A 14.4-inch-square module, the type used for outdoor displays, has sat in a vat of water and blinked for three years. In the Highly Accelerated Life Testing chamber, the temperature ranges from minus 166 degrees to 392 degrees to see if displays can tolerate cold and heat. Other displays sit under banks of infrared lights that simulate the intensity of the sun in Phoenix. Other tests replicate freezing rain and salty mist.\u201cWe have a goal for our products to last the same amount of time regardless of where they are,\u201d said Paul Gilk, who runs the reliability lab.Eric Johns, Gilk\u2019s colleague, put it another way. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to break them to see their weak points,\u201d he said.The heavy lifting of making modules \u2014 the building blocks of the displays \u2014 occurs in an adjacent building. With all the big orders Daktronics had received, the production line was running near capacity in two 10-hour daily shifts.The 13-step process to make a module starts with millions of red, green and blue diodes. When LED displays were introduced about two decades ago, the diodes cost about a dollar each. Now that they cost pennies, sports teams have been able to buy larger and more advanced displays for less.To generate extra revenue, Daktronics and other manufacturers have been developing software for teams to use on their displays. In addition to creating tailor-made graphics, Daktronics hosts seminars for programmers who operate scoreboards in Major League Baseball and N.F.L. stadiums.The scoreboards would not be possible without the hundreds of modules that come off the line every day. The process of making a module starts with a blank circuit board that runs through machines that attach drivers, chips, resistors, capacitors and other components. Three radial machines insert red, green and blue diodes. (The factory uses about 3.9 million of these LEDs in an average week.)After the LEDs are soldered to the circuit board, signal connectors, capacitors, coils and other components are inserted manually, then soldered as well.The boards are washed and dried to remove contaminants and placed in hard plastic casings. Any modules with malfunctioning LEDs are repaired. Silicone is applied to waterproof the modules, which are dried in an oven for six minutes. A robot drives screws into the modules, and power supplies are added.In all, it takes about 30 minutes to build a module, and one module comes off the line every 65 seconds. The precision and speed are results of an overhaul in production that took place in recent years.Neil Andal, who is in charge of improving production processes, said: \u201cOur customers want to do something bigger and better, so if we didn\u2019t improve our manufacturing, we couldn\u2019t keep up. No one ever said, \u2018I want a smaller scoreboard.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBigger Is ... BiggerThe process, which is based on many Japanese techniques, is far more efficient than it was when Kurtenbach and a fellow electrical engineering professor at nearby South Dakota State started the company in 1968.They were more interested in biomedical instrumentation than scoreboards. But an early investor in the company who was active in collegiate wrestling asked Kurtenbach to design a new scoreboard. With help from their students, Kurtenbach and his partner built a four-sided, four-foot-high tower with incandescent bulbs.As orders came in, Kurtenbach realized that there was a market for other scoreboards. Daktronics made voting tally boards for nearly every statehouse in the nation, then scoreboards for high schools and colleges. Later, they created scoreboards with basic video displays made by Sony, Mitsubishi Electric and others.To offset the unpredictable nature of the sports market, Daktronics expanded into traffic signs, commercial displays and other more stable businesses.Daktronics made scoreboards for many of the events at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y., but it did not enter the pro sports market until 1988. That year, Daktronics made a scoreboard for the Buffalo Bisons, a Class AAA baseball club. At a Bisons game, Kurtenbach met Joe Spear, the stadium\u2019s architect, who invited him to work on a new ballpark in Baltimore.Camden Yards opened in 1992 and touched off a frenzy of construction that emphasized throwback designs, better sightlines, fan-friendly concessions and prominently placed scoreboards.Orders poured in, and sales expanded overseas. Daktronics \u2014 an amalgam of the words Dakota and electronics \u2014 was listed on the Nasdaq stock market in 1994. Today, nearly every N.F.L. stadium has some Daktronics equipment, and the company\u2019s scoreboards are in many well-known venues, including Madison Square Garden and Citi Field.College stadiums are a growing opportunity, too, particularly at Division I universities whose wealthy donors are willing to pay for a display.One reason Daktronics has thrived in a town of about 22,000\u00a0has been its proximity to South Dakota State in Brookings. At any time, about 300 students work at the company as engineers, in marketing and sales, and in graphic arts and other departments.Kurtenbach recognized that employing students was crucial to grooming the next generation of workers without having to persuade people elsewhere to move to South Dakota.\u201cThey are a heck of a supplier of talent for us,\u201d Kurtenbach said of the university, where the engineering school is in Daktronics Hall.\u00a0David L. Chicoine, the university president, said: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to give students an option. When I went to school in South Dakota, if you had a tech background, you had to leave.\u201d\u00a0Daktronics\u2019s closest competitor in the roughly $800 million market, Mitsubishi Electric, has focused on marquee locations. With displays designed in Japan and assembled in Pittsburgh, Mitsubishi contends that its advanced technology provides higher resolution and seamless displays. It has displays in Yankee Stadium, AT&T Stadium outside Dallas and elsewhere.\u201cWe are focusing on the higher end of the market,\u201d said Todd Stih, a national sales manager at Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s scoreboard division. \u201cTiffany still has to sell the best.\u201dThe workers at Daktronics would disagree. They fasten modules into metal-frame cabinets that are 8 feet 4 inches tall and 7 feet 2 inches wide. Fans are attached in the back, and the modules are run hard for an hour to ensure that no LEDs burn out. A fully installed cabinet comes off the line about every five minutes.\u201cThe displays are so large,\u201d said Amber Peper, a master scheduler, \u201cit\u2019s not feasible to build them all at once because they\u2019re not going to install them at once.\u201dThe Jacksonville display required 416 cabinets. Crates of eight cabinets were shrink-wrapped and loaded onto flatbed tracks, which were parked at loading docks before their four-day ride to EverBank Field. Each crate, weighing about 2,800 pounds, was numbered to indicate its place in the display\u2019s frame.Before he left, Khan was given a Sharpie and asked to sign a cabinet numbered 53313. On the side, he wrote: \u201cWe were here. A OK.\u201dAn article last Sunday about Daktronics, one of the largest makers of sports video displays, contained an outdated reference to Fulham, the English soccer team that shares an owner with the N.F.L.\u2019s Jacksonville Jaguars, who have two new scoreboards from Daktronics. Fulham was relegated to the Football League Championship after last season; it is no longer in the Premier League.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Just for Rentals Anymore", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the WheelDespite its love affair with trucks and its flirtation with Euro-style subcompacts, the United States is first a nation of family sedans. Of every five new-vehicle buyers, one will drive home in a practical, unpretentious midsize sedan like their parents and grandparents before them. At which point their children will say, \u201cOh, Dad. Another Toyota Camry?\u201d Even with all that midsize showroom action, Chrysler seemed to pay lip service to sedans even while fawning over anything that looked like a truck or wore a Wild West badge, like the Dodge Caliber.Even that defunct compact car looked like a shrunken S.U.V., and it had a name to match. Chrysler\u2019s midsize cupboard also grew bare. Its egregious Sebring sedan and the Sebring\u2019s rental-counter successor, the 200 model of 2011-14, were cars that the post-bankruptcy Chrysler would like to forget. Now merged with Fiat of Italy, Chrysler has cut back on its S.U.V. navel gazing and rejoined the wider world of cars. An actual sedan, the Dodge Dart, has succeeded the Caliber. And on the Dart\u2019s Italian-bred heels comes Chrysler\u2019s best bid at family-car respectability in years: an all-new 200, built on a version of the Alfa Romeo platform that supports the Dart and Jeep Cherokee.After so much time in the sedan wilderness, the Chrysler could hardly expect to rule a class whose leaders include the Honda Accord, Mazda 6 and Ford Fusion. Yet the midsize Chrysler makes a case for inclusion, with a distinctively American design, an especially user-friendly cabin and the most powerful optional V6 in the class. Unlike the coming Jeep Renegade, a small Italian-built S.U.V. destined for international markets, the 200 will be homegrown. It is being produced in a plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., that recently received a $1 billion expansion.True to its Midwest roots, Chrysler\u2019s latest \u201cImported from Detroit\u201d model is a big old softy. If the Mazda 6 and Honda Accord occupy the athletic end of the family-car spectrum, the 200 is safely parked near the center. Comfort is king at the expense of anything resembling sporty handling, at least in the 200C AWD version that I tested.And Chrysler\u2019s ballyhooed 9-speed automatic transmission still seems to be in the teething stage, one toothy gear at a time.12 PhotosStill, as the perennially top-selling Camry proves, many family sedan buyers have no desire to make their tires \u2014 or passengers \u2014 squeal. Drivers who simply want a sharp, ergonomically correct and ultraquiet sedan may cozy up to this Chrysler.The 200 also delivers the sort of styling distinction, inside and out, that often eludes workaday sedans. Chrysler\u2019s new winged logo floats on a dark grille, cupped by a pair of droplet-shaped headlamps. A coupelike roofline dips down to a short rear deck. It\u2019s all nicely proportioned and surfaced, including a strong, extruded shoulder line that traces the car\u2019s length before executing a crisp downward turn.Chrysler was the last of the Big Three to get its interior act together. But from the Dodge Ram to the Jeep Grand Cherokee, and now the 200, the company seems intent on scrubbing shoppers\u2019 memories of cabins so dated that they deserved a VH1 special.The 200\u2019s interior is restrained, softly padded and satisfying, especially in the leather-swaddled 200C and 200S versions, whose niceties include optional open-pore wood inlays that recall the timber inside Audis. Those versions made me think of a dressed-up couple heading out for a big date and how the 200 would fit the stylish occasion.The UConnect infotainment system, part of a $1,395 Navigation and Sound package, is excellent, with notably user-friendly touch controls and voice commands. A banked center console features a Jaguar-style rotary knob to control the transmission. Dispensing with a mechanical shift lever, and the shoebox-size housing beneath it, opens up storage space on par with what you find in big S.U.V.s. The console cover integrates a pair of clever sliding cupholders, and there is a useful cord pass-through to a secondary outlet so that a driver and passenger can simultaneously charge their devices. Another tablet-size storage area beneath the banked controls features one of Chrysler\u2019s hidden \u201cEaster egg\u201d design details: An embossed rendition of the Detroit skyline \u2014 though this one manages to erase the city\u2019s signature skyscraper, the riverfront headquarters of General Motors. Artistic license, I imagine. The back seat does give up one or two inches of legroom to the roomiest competitors, including the Accord, but the trunk is enormous at 16 cubic feet, as is the truck-worthy glovebox. Chrysler\u2019s familiar 2.4-liter Tigershark 4-cylinder, making 184 horsepower, will be the popular engine choice; an LX version with that engine starts at just $22,695. One step up is the high-volume 200 Limited for $24,250, and the sportier 200S is $25,490.My heavily optioned 200C reached $34,675. Its 3.6-liter V6 \u2014 an engine strong enough to motivate some Ram pickups \u2014 delivered a class-topping 295 horsepower, with the sort of throaty sound that Asian rivals seem intent on muffling in their own cars. The all-wheel-drive system kept the big V6 from torturing the front wheels while delivering forceful acceleration. That charismatic V6 is a huge plus for this car, though the 9-speed gearbox is a minus. And the handling is no better than midpack in this class.Combine a softly sprung suspension with the heaviest curb weight in the class, and the roughly 3,900-pound 200C AWD begins to bob and wallow in faster corners. A spongy brake pedal doesn\u2019t help. Steering, however, is nicely weighted, though lacking in driver feedback. I did take a brief run in the 200S, whose sportier suspension did exert slightly more control over body motions. To the credit of the transmission, the many gears are a boon to fuel economy. With the 4-cylinder, the 200 is rated 23 miles per gallon in town, and 36 on the highway. The rating for the V6 is 19/32 with front drive and 18/29 with all-wheel drive.But while one point of a 9-speed is to be smooth and unobtrusive, this unit is anything but. Seventh, eighth and ninth gear are all fuel-sipping overdrives, and that\u2019s at least one too many. The transmission busily hunts for the right gear, and sometimes lurches when it finally makes up its mind. At times, the transmission also denied my commands to select ninth gear, delivered via the shift paddles behind the wheel, while a patronizing \u201cshift not allowed\u201d message flashed on the display. Even the car isn\u2019t fooled, well aware that 7-8-9 is a losing hand for anything but steady cruising, preferably in Florida and other hill-free locales. When your right foot summons actual acceleration, the transmission hesitates, then skips all the way to fifth or even fourth to get the job done. The 200 does ante up with the latest safety and convenience features, including a lane-departure and lane-keeping system, a blind-spot monitor, collision warning and adaptive cruise control. They\u2019re part of a $1,295 Safety Tec package that also lets the 200 automatically park itself in parallel or perpendicular fashion. The system worked great, precisely snugging up to curbs with less than an inch to spare, yet never brushing a wheel. Now, if the 200 could pick up prospects and ferry them to the nearest Chrysler dealership, more people might put this made-in-Motown sedan on their shopping list. When you\u2019ve essentially ceded the sedan game for so long, winning people back is never easy. But the 200 is a good start. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Italy Accuses Germany of Undermining Its Economic Efforts", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s prime minister on Friday accused Germany\u2019s central bank of blocking efforts to stimulate regional growth and putting the interests of financiers before citizens in the European Union.Matteo Renzi, a youthful left-leaning politician who became the Italian prime minister in February, has adopted a muscular stance on the European stage since his party won a strong endorsement in elections to the European Parliament in May. Mr. Renzi has called upon the European authorities to put less emphasis on debt and deficit targets, a position that has provoked a public dispute with some prominent Germans.On Friday, Mr. Renzi appeared to relish the chance to deliver a sharp retort to Jens Weidmann, the president of the German central bank, the Bundesbank. Mr. Weidman has long called for fiscal restraint by the most vulnerable euro zone countries, including Italy.\u201cI don\u2019t expect the Bundesbank to talk about Italian politics,\u201d Mr. Renzi said in a news conference in Rome. \u201cWe should all bear in mind that Europe belongs to European citizens, not to bankers \u2014 neither Italian nor German bankers.\u201dMr. Renzi did not mention Mr. Weidmann by name. But a day earlier Mr. Weidmann suggested that Mr. Renzi should focus on making the Italian economy more competitive, rather than increasing debt. Italy\u2019s national debt stands at about 130 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, the third-largest such ratio in the developed world, after those of Japan and Greece.Mr. Weidmann\u2019s comments, made to politicians from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s party, were carried widely in the Italian news media on Friday morning.Mr. Renzi has a new forum for speaking out, now that Italy is taking its turn in the revolving presidency of the union. While that role is largely ceremonial, rotating every six months among the bloc\u2019s 28 nations, it still gives Mr. Renzi a platform to push the Europe to put less emphasis on austerity than many in Germany, the bloc\u2019s strongest economy, would like. Italy\u2019s term began July 1.Speaking at the same news conference in Rome on Friday, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the departing president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said Mr. Renzi was correct to identify the need to ease austerity policies. But Mr. Barroso suggested that the commission had already shown a sufficient degree of flexibility toward countries like France under the current rule book, and he warned that it would be hazardous to go further.\u201cThe worst thing we could now do is to appear that we don\u2019t respect our own rules,\u201d Mr. Barroso said. The danger is that \u201cthe markets will start again betting against some of our member states,\u201d said Mr. Barroso, who noted there were serious of \u201cthreats against Italy\u201d during the recent European debt crisis.Italian officials say their goal is to buy more time for nations using the euro to meet budget targets when they make painful structural changes in areas like pensions, workers\u2019 rights and health care. That, however, could raise thorny issues for the European Commission, which would have to decide when such changes have been completed and whether they are sufficient to merit leniency.Italy is putting the focus on growth at a time when its economy remains in a precarious state. Analysts say countries including Spain have done far more than Italy to make their economies more internationally competitive in the wake of the European debt crisis.A closely watched purchasing managers\u2019 index for Italy fell to a three-month low in June, according to a report released on Tuesday by Markit, a financial information company. Italian unemployment rose to 12.6 percent in May, compared with 12.1 percent a year earlier, according to Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics agency.Advertisement"}

The danger is that government policy or, rather, lack of policy, will lock in an economy of diminished opportunity and reduced expectations. Take, for example, how long-term unemployment and part-time employment can interact to create a permanently lower standard of living. In June, the share of unemployed people out of work for more than six months continued to tick down, while part-time jobs by those who need full-time work increased. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that some of the long-term unemployed are shifting into part-time work, which may be better than prolonged joblessness but is not a path to sufficiency, let alone prosperity. Worse, the spread of part-time work could be bad news for the 9.5 million people who are unemployed and for the millions who enter the work force every year. It allows employers to add hours, not employees, if things improve.At the same time, hours and wages are not growing for most workers. In addition, average hourly pay, $20.58 in June, has long failed to keep up with growth in productivity. If it had, it would be around $35 an hour. That is not just a raw deal for workers. It is bad for the economy because real wage growth is the basis of economic growth.We have more jobs and more hiring, but lousy pay. What\u2019s needed is economic growth that is broad, strong and sustained enough to employ sidelined workers, restore opportunity and raise wages. Still unanswered, five years into the recovery, is where that growth will come from. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On State Unemployment Rates, It\u2019s Analyst Beware", "Date": "2014-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnical DifficultiesLet\u2019s start with the most obvious issue: There\u2019s no point in analyzing data on the number of people receiving jobless benefits in North Carolina. Kicking the long-term unemployed off benefits will mechanically reduce the number of people receiving benefits. This tells us nothing about the central question, which is whether those people ultimately landed jobs or not.The very fact that the number of people on benefit rolls can fluctuate because of changes in the unemployment insurance system, rather than changes in the economy, largely explains why economists don\u2019t typically measure unemployment by counting the number of beneficiaries. Instead, we tally unemployment through a large-scale survey called the Current Population Survey, which asks people whether they\u2019re working, or looking for work.In order to reliably estimate the national unemployment rate, the Current Population Survey asks 60,000 households nationwide about their employment situation. Even then, the estimated unemployment rate is measured with error. But when you zero in on North Carolina, it\u2019s surveying closer to 1,200 households, which probably includes only around 100 unemployed people, and as few as several dozen long-term unemployed directly affected by the benefit cut.Although the Current Population Survey is sufficiently large that it can somewhat reliably estimate the unemployment rate for the country as a whole, even statisticians at the Bureau of Labor Statistics think it\u2019s wildly insufficient for measuring unemployment or long-term unemployment in any particular state.Therefore, the officially published unemployment rate is not in fact a measure of the unemployment rate. Instead, it\u2019s an amalgam of the household unemployment survey (but conducted on such a small scale at the state level as to yield unreliable estimates), a count of the number of people receiving unemployment benefits (which will be distorted by changes in which subset of the unemployed are eligible), and a survey asking people to report on the number of people on their payrolls (which tells us about employment, rather than unemployment). Moreover, the estimate that this model gives for, say, unemployment in June, reflects not only the results of labor market data from June, but also past and (when available) future data.It\u2019s virtually impossible to say much about what is happening to unemployment from month to month at the state level, particularly following changes to who is egible for unemployment benefits. Similar problems plague the official measures of labor force participation by state.We do have reliable measures of employment, though, which is why I analyze the nonfarm payroll numbers directly, and support that analysis by crunching data from an even more reliable measure of employment drawn from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. (Indeed, that data is sufficiently reliable that in due course, the government statisticians will revise their estimate of nonfarm payrolls to reflect them. )Unfortunately, these statistical limitations of the officially published state unemployment and labor force participation rates are not widely understood. A result is that every analysis I\u2019ve seen of recent developments in North Carolina has focused almost exclusively on this data, despite their deficiencies.The lesson here is that measuring the evolution of state labor markets is a lot harder than you might think.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Republicans Resume Efforts to Reduce Fed\u2019s Power", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans frustrated by the Federal Reserve\u2019s expansive economic stimulus campaign and its growing role as a financial regulator are renewing their efforts to constrain the central bank.The Fed would be required to set monetary policy based on a published formula under legislation introduced this week by leading Republicans on the Financial Services Committee. Other bills would eliminate the Fed\u2019s responsibility to maximize employment, or eliminate the Fed entirely.The bills face uncertain prospects in the House, and have no future in the Senate while it remains under Democratic control. But they highlight ideas that Republicans are likely to revisit if they win a majority in both houses of Congress in the midterm elections.\u201cWe have seen a radical departure from the historic norms of monetary policy conduct,\u201d Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, who is chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said at a hearing on Thursday. \u201cMonetary policy is at its best in maintaining stable, healthy economic growth when it follows a clear, predictable rule or path.\u201dThe most prominent piece of legislation, sponsored by Representatives Bill Huizenga of Michigan and Scott Garrett of New Jersey, is a result of a yearlong series of hearings orchestrated by Mr. Hensarling\u2019s committee to review the Fed\u2019s performance on the occasion of its 100th anniversary.It would require the Fed to set interest rates based on a published rule like the Taylor Rule, a formula written by the Stanford University economist John B. Taylor that specifies the appropriate level of interest rates based on the pace of inflation and the gap between actual and potential economic output. The Fed would be required to explain deviations from its rule, although it could change the rule. It would also be subject to audits by the Government Accountability Office. The Fed has moved in the direction favored by Republicans in recent years, most notably by adopting an explicit inflation target in 2012. But the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and other officials have emphasized the need for flexibility. Professor Taylor, for example, argues that under his formula the Fed should already have raised short-term interest rates above 1 percent, while the Fed has indicated it plans to keep rates near zero into next year to encourage job growth.Professor Taylor said at Thursday\u2019s hearing that the legislation left the Fed \u201cenough flexibility\u201d to deviate from the rule in a crisis. \u201cIt seems to me to be the essence of transparency and accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could someone object to that?\u201dSimon H. Johnson, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, responded that the legislation would not succeed in making monetary policy more predictable, but instead inject politics into the process.\u201cThe experts have to have the ability to make these decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going to get from this is a massive amount of volatility in financial markets.\u201dA second prong of the legislation is focused on the Fed\u2019s regulatory role, requiring the central bank to subject proposed rules to a cost-benefit analysis. Republicans describe this as a common-sense requirement already imposed on most arms of the federal government. Democrats counter that it is an effort to impede the expansion of regulation required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democratic member of the committee, said the requirement would \u201ccripple\u201d the Fed \u201cby making the Fed\u2019s rule-making more tedious, more expensive and subject to endless legal challenges.\u201dHester Peirce, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who testified on Thursday in support of the legislation, said a little trouble was worth it. \u201cIt may take the Fed a little longer to adopt a rule, but these rules are in place for years and years,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ll end up with is higher-quality rules.\u201dThe legislation includes a variety of other measures to increase transparency, including quarterly congressional testimony by the Fed\u2019s chief and disclosure of the salaries of highly paid employees. It would also create a staff for each member of the Fed\u2019s board, increasing the ability to conduct independent research.Republicans unhappy about the Fed\u2019s expansive campaign to stimulate the economy have sought repeatedly in recent years to rein in the central bank. The House in 2012 passed legislation increasing oversight of the Fed\u2019s decision-making process, although the details were different then.Another bill now before the House would require the Fed to focus on controlling inflation, eliminating its legal obligation to seek to maximize employment, a mandate made explicit in the 1970s. Another would eliminate the central bank entirely.\u201cAll anyone cares about is what the Fed is going to do,\u201d said Representative John Campbell, a California Republican who said he favored the relatively modest approach of requiring the Fed to specify and follow a policy rule. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re running the whole show, and to me that\u2019s a distortion of the way that the economy is supposed to work. We\u2019re just saying, please give the market some stability here.\u201dThe Fed has not responded publicly to the latest proposals, but it has objected to similar ideas as impairing its freedom to manage interest rates. Ms. Yellen is likely to face questions on the subject when she appears before House and Senate panels on Tuesday and Wednesday for semiannual testimony.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Darkness Falls on Gaza", "Date": "2014-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorGAZA CITY RAMADAN, when night descends, is usually a joyous time. Friends and family gather to break their fast at the iftar meal. Not this year. Nights are the worst. That is when the bombing escalates. Nowhere is safe. Not a mosque. Not a church. Not a school, or even a hospital. All are potential targets.On Monday, the Israeli military fired artillery rounds at Al Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, claiming to target a cache of anti-tank missiles. Dr. Khalil Khattab, a surgeon, was operating on a patient when the first shell struck. He ran to the floors below to discover at least four dead and dozens of colleagues \u2014 doctors, nurses, orderlies and administrators \u2014 injured. The medical staff had become patients.The Gaza Strip \u2014 a little less than half the size of New York City \u2014 is home to 1.8 million people, mainly Muslims, with a small Christian minority. Its population is cut off from the world, living under the blockade imposed by Egypt and Israel in 2007. For anyone over the age of 7, this is the third time they\u2019ve lived through a sustained attack.In two weeks of bombing and shelling, more than 600 Palestinians have been reported killed. Since the Israeli ground invasion began, 28 Israeli soldiers have died; the conflict has also claimed the lives of two Israeli civilians.Here in Gaza City, the electricity was gone; it was dark everywhere. The water supply was foul, food was rancid, and fear permeated the summer night.On Eighth Street, I visited the al-Baba family. For this family of 15, a corrugated tin roof was all that stood between them and the bombs. Hani al-Baba, 23, heard the hum of a drone. Some are for surveillance, some are weaponized. Which is which, one never knows. The sound was enough to send the children scurrying into corners, trembling and praying. Nervously, Hani scanned the night sky. Suddenly, a bomb exploded in the field behind the al-Babas\u2019 house: a boom followed by a flash of light. Everyone screamed. The ground shook, the air seemed to implode, sucking the breath from lungs.Then it was dark again. Why this area was being bombed was unclear. There were no \u201cterrorists,\u201d no rockets. It was a neighborhood of families, scared and cowering in the dark.The long siege has bled the Gaza Strip dry. There is no money for public services; the majority of the population lives in abject poverty. And now at least 120,000 Gazans have been displaced by the fighting, thousands taking temporary shelter in United Nations schools. Many will return to homes damaged or destroyed, with little or no means to rebuild. Cement is especially severely rationed because Israel suspects it is diverted by Hamas to build tunnels for fighters.In Shifa Hospital, what struck me were the resilience and dignity of the families. Forced to evacuate under gunfire, they had become refugees in their own land. I watched a grandmother who\u2019d fled the east of the city comforting her four grandchildren and two daughters. The family broke their fast with slices of bread, two yogurts, cucumber and tomatoes. This was their iftar.A cease-fire agreement is possible, but all parties need to be at the table; Hamas was not consulted over the one proposed by Egypt last week. Even peace might be possible \u2014 if the international community has the courage to engage in dialogue with Hamas. The terms outlined by Hamas for a cease-fire are the same as those the United Nations has called for repeatedly: open the border crossings; let people work, study and build the economy. A population capable of taking care of its own would enhance Israel\u2019s security. One that cannot leads to desperation. In January 2008, barriers along the Gaza-Egypt border were knocked down. Thousands of Gazans poured into Egypt to acquire much needed supplies. I remember the relief within the Palestinian community. This transient glimpse of freedom was a treat.A neighbor of mine was simply delighted to drink a Coca-Cola. The freedom to move, fresh food and clean water, and the simple pleasure of sipping a soda, this is what Gazans need: the normal life everyone else takes for granted. During the first days the border was open, Hamas suspended rocket attacks from Gaza. Israeli politicians should take note.Whatever its official statements, Israel has no interest in destroying Hamas; it seeks merely to weaken and isolate it. Hamas gives Israel an out, a convenient villain, someone to blame. Yet the siege of Gaza serves no purpose other than to radicalize the next generation. Families like the al-Babas shouldn\u2019t have to move their children around the house in the hope that some may survive. Nor should families in Ashdod, over the border in Israel, have to hide in bomb shelters from the militants\u2019 rockets.Without a process that includes all parties at the negotiating table, though, I fear this cycle of violence, punitive and disproportionate as it is, can lead only to an Islamic State in Iraq and Syria-type extremism among the Palestinians. Only the darkest cynic would wish for that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "World of Our Great-Grandfathers", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack in the days when Jews could travel without having to go anywhere \u2014 one minute a house was in Poland, the next in Russia \u2014 they lived in places called shtetls, defined neither by physical size nor population, possessing mysterious features both urban and rural. Though Christians lived there too, the shtetl tilted spiritually toward Jerusalem, while performing economic services for the Slavic society to which it also belonged, giving it an Eastern European character all its own. Its amorphous nature has made it the subject of easy mythologizing, so that it often pops up in the American imagination as a kind of Jewish Brigadoon where all the villagers are singing, unless they are running from a pogrom.Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern, a professor of Jewish studies at Northwestern University, would like us to view the shtetl as neither the spiritual apotheosis nor the physical nadir of Jewish exile. For this he has to do some digging, because while the giants of Yiddish literature were around to record the shtetl\u2019s gasping decline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, its \u201cgolden age\u201d \u2014 which he puts roughly between the 1790s and the 1840s \u2014 is a tale that lives mainly in the archives.\u201cThe Golden Age Shtetl\u201d focuses on three provinces in central Ukraine. It is populated by \u201cJewish tavernkeepers, international smugglers, members of Slavic gangs, traders in colonial commodities, disloyal husbands and avid readers of books.\u201d Determined to keep these unsung heroes from remaining the pale ink in someone else\u2019s palimpsest, Petrovsky-Shtern is not beyond his own mythologizing impulses. His shtetl-folk possess \u201cthe mental qualities of urban dwellers and the corporeal capabilities of peasants.\u201d He mythologizes himself a little, too, telling us that in order to get his hands on hidden documents, \u201cI sometimes disguised myself as a Ukrainian clerk, a Soviet speleologist and a polar explorer.\u201d One feels the author, who grew up in Ukraine, imagining himself as one of those Jewish smugglers he writes about, men who could \u201chandle a lance to intimidate the mounted border patrol; a sword if they had to engage the guards in a fight and pistols to protect their booty from the Cossack guards.\u201d Smuggling looms large not only in the economy of Petrovsky-Shtern\u2019s shtetl but for its symbolism, too. The author is interested in the way aspects of one world slide inside another. His golden-age shtetl was born when Russia swallowed a giant slice of Poland at the end of the 18th century and went from having few Jews to overseeing vast numbers of them, many of whom lived in privately owned Polish towns. These towns are the essential ingredients of the hybrid world Petrovsky-Shtern is celebrating. Polish nobles had permitted Jews to live there on the condition that they ran the outdoor markets, sold liquor and in general acted as engines of trade. When the towns fell under Russian rule, Jews retained many of their economic privileges while expanding their civil rights, especially after they displayed a willingness to inform on their erstwhile Polish overlords.Shtetl dwellers became adept at playing the declining Polish nobility off against bribable Russian officials. The czar had not yet laid his heavy hand on the trade by which shtetl Jews powered the economic growth of western Russia. Neither had he made nationalism the supreme ideology and Eastern Orthodoxy synonymous with Russian nationalism.That would come, and as the Russian treasury bought up more and more of the private towns and trade died, Russia repurposed shtetl Jews as scapegoats for a restive peasant population. But before that happened in the second half of the 19th century, a rough collaborative spirit prevailed, which Petrovsky-Shtern finds evidence of in everything from the Yiddish slang used by Slavic gangsters to the story of \u201can ambitious and dodgy Eastern Orthodox priest\u201d who teamed up with \u201ca greedy and sleazy Jewish informer\u201d to bring down a pious Jewish printer. The book sets the bar for cross-\u00adcultural collaboration a little low in places, as it does for instances of Jewish physical pride \u2014 not always distinguishing between self-defense, domestic violence and possible mental illness. But if he sometimes works too hard to push over the old straw shtetl in favor of one that \u201cat its height was afraid of nothing,\u201d Petrovsky-Shtern also succeeds in vividly evoking a Jewish world that survived not merely in spite of its neighbors but in complex collaboration with them. There is a reason much of this has been forgotten. The golden-age shtetl lies at the heart of what the historian Timothy Snyder calls \u201cthe bloodlands,\u201d a region that was a central battleground in the war against the Jews. Which makes \u201cThe Golden Age Shtetl\u201d a moving feat of cultural reclamation and even, in its way, an act of quiet heroism.THE GOLDEN AGE SHTETLA New History of Jewish Life in East EuropeBy Yohanan Petrovsky-ShternIllustrated. 431 pp. Princeton University Press. $29.95.Jonathan Rosen is the author of \u201cThe Talmud and the Internet: A Journey Between Worlds,\u201d among other books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Sanctions Pile Up, Russians\u2019 Alarm Grows Over Putin\u2019s Tactics", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia, facing the toughest round of Western sanctions imposed since the Ukraine crisis erupted, has adopted a nonchalant public stance, with President Vladimir V. Putin emphasizing the importance of self-reliance and a new poll released Tuesday indicating a \u201cWhat, me worry?\u201d attitude among the bulk of the population.But beneath that calm facade, there is growing alarm in Russia that the festering turmoil in Ukraine and the new round of far more punitive sanctions \u2014 announced Tuesday by both European nations and the United States \u2014 will have an impact on Russia\u2019s relations with the West for years to come and damage the economy to the extent that ordinary Russians feel it.Until now, Mr. Putin\u2019s tactics seemed to be working. Russia was feeding the separatist insurgency in Ukraine without leaving distinct fingerprints \u2014 able to press Kiev to come to terms while avoiding a rupture with Europe that would alienate Russia\u2019s business elite. But that strategy is beginning to crumble, battered under successive shock waves generated by the crisis.More frequent and prominent critics are saying that Mr. Putin and the hard-line leaders in the Kremlin overreached by suggesting that Russia, far more dependent than the old Soviet Union on international trade and financial markets, could thrive without the West.\u201cThey were not anticipating the West to make radical moves, costly moves,\u201d said Nikolai Petrov, an independent political analyst. \u201cWhat is happening is different from what they wanted and what they expected.\u201dHe and others pointed to the downing of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 over embattled southeastern Ukraine on July 17 as upsetting the balancing act that Mr. Putin had managed to pull off to maintain support from the public, hard-line nationalists, the security services, the oligarchs and the more liberal business community.\u201cUntil this catastrophe, Putin\u2019s calculations were pretty good in terms of being able to win any tactical battle,\u201d Mr. Petrov said.The Kremlin had been counting on its ability to maintain just enough instability in Ukraine to keep the country dependent on Russian good will, while making Europe and the United States cautious about intervening too assertively there.Right after this weekend, when the likelihood of more serious European sanctions materialized, Mr. Putin met with advisers to say that Russia needed to become self-reliant. He was referring to arms production previously done in Ukraine, but the sentiment echoed in other fields.\u201cNo matter what the difficulties we may encounter, and to be honest, I do not really see any big difficulties so far,\u201d he said, according to a transcript on the Kremlin website, \u201cI think that they will ultimately work to our advantage because they will give us the needed incentive to develop our production capability in areas where we had not done so yet.\u201dMap of European energy imports that come from Russia.Domestically, grumbling over the creeping isolationism has grown louder. Roughly 50 percent of the economy is state-run, and the loyalty of those who direct such companies to Mr. Putin remains absolute. But the rest are changing.\u201cIt is still a very polite version: \u2018Maybe something is going wrong,\u2019 \u201d said Sergei Petrov, an opposition member of Parliament and the founder of Rolf, one of the biggest car importers in Russia. \u201cThey would never say it to you, a foreigner, but I hear more and more critics.\u201dA former finance minister and a close Putin ally, Alexei Kudrin, voiced rare public criticism of Kremlin policy in an interview last week with the state-run news agency ITAR-TASS.Mr. Kudrin said he was worried that the Ukraine crisis would drive Russia into a \u201chistoric confrontation\u201d that would retard the country\u2019s development across the board.Business leaders were dismayed by the amount of anti-Western comments on television and radio, he said, indicating a \u201cfundamental\u201d shift that made the West Russia\u2019s adversary again.\u201cThings are different in business,\u201d he said. \u201cBusinessmen want to work, to invest, build factories and develop trade.\u201dSome analysts saw that interview as a sign that Mr. Putin was looking for a way out, preparing to abandon the Ukraine separatists publicly. They linked it to a similar sentiment in a column in the newspaper Kommersant on Tuesday, by a journalist close to the president, suggesting that he had allowed the black boxes from the Malaysian airliner to be sent to the West because he did not fully trust the information he got from his advisers.But there has been no direct indication from Mr. Putin that he wants to change tacks.Officially, Russia tried to play down the airplane disaster, which killed all 298 people on board, although some news outlets raised questions from the start. The front page of the government-owned Rossiyskaya Gazeta the day after the crash put the report on the bottom half \u2014 the top story was that Russians were eating less bread and potatoes.The general sense here was that the West was again piling on Russia without evidence \u2014 that it was a political issue.\u201cIn my opinion, we face a critical situation today,\u201d Lev Gudkov, the director of the Levada Center, an independent polling organization, told a weekend seminar audience. \u201cBut our society does not realize it against a backdrop of patriotic and chauvinistic euphoria.\u201dThat euphoria was rooted in the relatively bloodless, seemingly costless annexation of Crimea in March. The public expected that the rest of the crisis in Ukraine would be resolved with similar ease.\u201cThe situation began changing dramatically after the crash of the Boeing,\u201d Mr. Gudkov said. \u201cAccording to our research, reaction inside the country was quite weak, but the Western European public has drastically changed its attitude towards Russia.\u201dIndeed, poll results released Tuesday by the Levada Center showed the Russian public barely concerned about sanctions. More than 60 percent of respondents thought they would have little or no impact on them. Mr. Putin remains hugely popular.The official attitude was also calm. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore it,\u201d the foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said at a news conference on Monday when asked about the expected sanctions. \u201cBut to fall into hysterics and respond to a blow with a blow is not worthy of a major country.\u201dMr. Lavrov also expressed disappointment that the Ukraine crisis was damaging relations between Russia and the West, but said repeatedly that it was the fault of Western capitals because they had encouraged Ukraine to fight rather than negotiate.\u201cNo one is pleased with the deterioration of relations between the partners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to influence the situation in Ukraine to move it from the military confrontation to political negotiations.\u201dBut others were less sanguine as the sanctions piled up.Beyond sanctions, an arbitration court in The Hague ruled Monday that Russia should pay former Yukos shareholders $50 billion for breaking up the oil and gas company decade ago. The ruling added an element of uncertainty to dealing with Gazprom and Rosneft, the two state-controlled giants of the Russian energy economy that absorbed Yukos holdings.Economic issues are likely to broaden the split between the more liberal economists and the conservative members of the security services, analysts said. Mr. Putin makes all the crucial decisions, however, and no one is likely to challenge him directly.\u201cThere is a split, but the antiwar party lacks the instruments to force Putin into practical action,\u201d said Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister turned opposition politician.Kremlin officials seeking to break with the West believe that whatever financing they lose there, they can regain from China or India, Mr. Milov said, without realizing that neither banking system is geared to provide the billions in long-term credit that Russian companies routinely got from Western banks.Indeed, at a recent dinner party, a Kremlin confidant said that the future would be all about \u201cRussian might and Chinese wealth.\u201d Did the West not worry, he mused aloud, that China would be the big winner?Over all, Mr. Milov said, the outlook seems bleak.\u201cWe are sliding into something which is clearly becoming a long-term standoff, and Putin looks committed and not ready to give up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a bad sign that everything is becoming a long-term problem.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about growing concern in Russia over President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s aggressive stance on Ukraine, which has led to more sanctions and strained relations with the West, misstated part of the name of the government newspaper that published a front-page article about the downing of a Malaysia Airlines flight over Ukraine on July 17. The paper is Rossiyskaya Gazeta, not Gazeta Russkaya.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Crisis Is Testing E.U.\u2019s Resolve", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 As it pushed efforts to coalesce around tougher sanctions against Russia, the European Union on Thursday was preparing to draw up lists of oligarchs close to President Vladimir V. Putin, working out how it could limit Russian access to European financial markets and studying the risk that Russia would respond by limiting Europe\u2019s energy supplies.But hanging over the talks was a bigger question: Can the 28-member bloc reconcile competing national interests, directly confront a conflict on its own borders and prove that it has a meaningful and united role to play in foreign policy?More than any other recent crisis, the Russian incursion into Ukraine and all that has followed, including the downing last week of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over territory in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists, has highlighted the glacial pace of decision making within the European Union. And it has given impatient critics, in the United States and elsewhere, additional reason to complain that the union is unwilling to take strong stands even when confronted with a clear case for action.The European bureaucracy ground forward a bit on Thursday, as ambassadors from the member nations met to draw up a list of Russian individuals, companies and entities to be named on Friday as targets of a new round of sanctions. The entities were likely to include the self-declared republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, and the individuals would probably include additional members of the Security Council of Russia, according to E.U. officials.The ambassadors were also discussing ways of identifying targets of potential sanctions among oligarchs who are members of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle, but officials said those names still needed to be agreed on, a step that could be taken next week.At the same time, officials from the policy-making European Commission sent the bloc\u2019s member governments a road map for even broader sanctions, eagerly awaited by the Obama administration, that could target entire sectors of the Russian economy \u2014 like restricting Europeans from doing business with Russian-controlled banks, limiting sales of technologies and materials needed for its crucial energy industry and restricting the sale of equipment that could have military uses. Such sweeping measures would be available as a response from Europe if Moscow blocks independent inquiries into the downing of the Malaysian plane and fails to prevent arms supplies across its border with Ukraine.The outcome of the effort to marshal a more muscular response is still unclear. With the 28 members having often-divergent economic and diplomatic interests \u2014 and most likely willing to pay different prices for collective action \u2014 even agreement on the ground rules for the sector-wide sanctions could require a further summit meeting of European leaders in Brussels next week.\u201cThe great difficulty for the E.U. acting collectively against Russia is a triple lockout,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the director for Europe of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe Germans don\u2019t want to jeopardize their energy interests, the French don\u2019t want to risk their military sales, and the British don\u2019t want to go too hard on Russian financial interests.\u201dThe bloc\u2019s indecision over the projection of power beyond its borders as it confronts a resurgent Russia has been illustrated by its inability to choose a successor to its foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, whose term expires at the end of October.At a summit meeting on July 16, an attempt by Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, to secure the job for his own foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, foundered on concerns that she may be too conciliatory toward Russia. The leaders handled the deadlock in time-honored European fashion: by scheduling another meeting for Aug. 30.For all that, the United States, which has expressed frustration with the sluggish response from Europe to Russia\u2019s involvement in Ukraine, suggested this week that it perceived a new willingness among its European allies to make hard economic choices. And in a statement on Tuesday, the State Department effectively put the bloc on notice that Washington was expecting tangible results.A State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said in the statement that the sanctions package could be expected to consist of \u201crestrictive measures \u2014 including access to capital markets; defense; dual-use goods; and sensitive technologies, including in the energy sector \u2014 if Russia does not cooperate immediately and in full with the Council\u2019s demands, including stopping the supply of weapons, equipment and militants to Ukraine, and withdrawing its additional troops from the border area.\u201dTensions among the European powers have burst into the open in recent days, with British and French officials trading jibes over whether France should proceed with the sale of warships to Russia and whether Britain would be willing to give up some of the benefits of the vast flow of Russian wealth into London. German officials have signaled growing impatience with Mr. Putin but have yet to show their hand publicly on how aggressive a package of sanctions they would back.European leaders were frequent visitors to Kiev in the tumultuous months preceding the ouster in February of Viktor F. Yanukovych, Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russia president, and they promoted closer ties between Ukraine and the West. But Europe\u2019s leaders appeared to miscalculate the degree of opposition they would provoke from Mr. Putin, who proved intent on keeping Ukraine from moving more fully into the orbit of the West, and only now, after the shooting down of the Malaysia Airline jet, are they seriously deliberating a set of sanctions with real bite to them.Part of the thinking may be that, as in the Cold War when East and West faced off with nuclear arsenals, the costs of the Ukraine crisis would be high for both sides. Some Western European nations, including Germany and Italy, are heavily dependent on Russian gas supplies, while some of the bloc\u2019s newer members in Eastern Europe \u2014 once under Soviet dominance behind the Iron Curtain \u2014 are even more reliant.A web of business deals between European Union nations and Russia, moreover, encompasses everything from German machine tools and autos, to luxury Italian leatherwear and the disputed French commitment to supply the Russian navy with two advanced Mistral-class warships. French and British banks have lent substantial sums to Russian companies. And, as French officials have taken to pointing out in recent days, many superrich Russian oligarchs own homes and even soccer teams in Britain.The interdependence has heightened concerns among some Europeans that punitive measures against Russia could easily boomerang.So even as the Europeans ramp up their stance against the Kremlin, they seem unlikely, analysts said, to adopt measures that would seek to isolate entire sectors of the Russian economy. \u201cYou need to keep the big three on board,\u201d said Mr. Rahman, referring to the preponderant influence of Britain, France and Germany.\u201cThe way you get around their triple lockout is by restricting European business with a number of companies in the energy, defense and financial sectors,\u201d he said. \u201cThis more robust approach may get translated into concrete action by August depending on what happens at the crash site and whether cross-border arms deliveries taper off,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cBut you will almost certainly never get full sanctions on an entire sector of the Russian economy from the Europeans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, New-Home Prices Declined in June", "Date": "2014-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 New-home prices in China fell in June for a second consecutive month and are expected to continue declining \u2014 a challenge for Beijing if prices fall too sharply and put further pressure on the economy.The signs on Friday of a drop in home prices coincided with property data published on Wednesday that showed real estate investment slowed in the first half of 2014, while sales and new construction slipped.Some analysts now expect more price declines in the coming months as developers experience sliding sales and an acute funding shortage \u2014 even though official figures showed home sales improved slightly in June from May.\u201cWe believe prices will drop further in the second half of this year, as more developers will cut prices to boost sales,\u201d said Liu Yuan, head of research at the property consulting firm Centaline in Shanghai.The average prices of new homes in 70 major cities fell 0.5 percent in June from the previous month, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.2 percent monthly drop, according to Reuters calculations based on data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday.Analysts expect the downturn in the property market to continue in the second half of the year, forcing local governments to put extra measures into effect to support the market and safeguard their revenue.\u201cThis could be a turning point. The policy could be accommodative, and lending to first-time home buyers could be relaxed,\u201d said Wee Liat Lee, the Hong Kong-based head of property research at BNP Paribas.Chen Zhenggao, China\u2019s newly appointed housing minister, said that local governments could set policies to stabilize local property markets based on their own needs, The 21st Century Business Herald reported on Friday, suggesting that the local authorities will be given more flexibility to act.Mr. Chen\u2019s comments propelled market expectations of more policy easing in coming months, sending property shares up as much as 3.2 percent Friday morning, the biggest rise in three and a half months.Real estate, which accounts for more than 15 percent of China\u2019s annual economic output and directly affects around 40 other business sectors in the nation, was cited as a brake on economic activity \u2014 even though gross domestic product data for the second quarter showed growth picked up slightly to 7.5 percent.The June housing data showed new-home prices fell in 55 of 70 cities polled, compared with a decline in 35 cities in May.The drop also spread to the country\u2019s wealthiest cities. Shanghai and the southern city of Guangzhou fell 0.6 percent, while Shenzhen dropped 0.4 percent.The worst month-on-month performance was in the eastern city of Hangzhou, where prices fell 1.7 percent in June.Existing-home prices also dropped month-on-month in 52 cities in June, compared with 35 in May.Compared with a year ago, new-home prices rose 4.2 percent in June, slipping from the previous month\u2019s 5.6 percent rise \u2014 the slowest annual growth in 15 months.A mild cooling-off in the housing market will be welcomed by policy makers, who have worked for nearly five years to curb property speculation.Still, Beijing does not want to see the market crash, and efforts have already been made to stop the market from sliding any further.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Job Law Misses the Mark ", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt also makes administrative changes that will allow for a greater focus on services for veterans, the disabled, the long-term unemployed and other groups facing specific job challenges. Just as important, the law requires greater accountability and data-gathering on federal-state job training programs, so job seekers and the public can more reliably ascertain what works and what doesn\u2019t in the search for good jobs at good pay.For all its aims, however, the new law falls short of addressing the larger problem of unemployment and underemployment. Its premise is that jobs are there for the taking and that many unemployed workers would qualify for these jobs if only they could acquire the necessary skills. A corollary is that a skills deficit is at the root of the nation\u2019s current low employment and stagnating wages. Evidence, however, tells a different story, namely that the economy is and has long been too weak to create enough jobs, even for experienced and skilled workers and for young people graduating from college. According to the latest federal labor data, there were still more than twice as many job seekers as job openings in May. That means that if all the job openings were filled tomorrow, more than five million of the nation\u2019s 9.8 million officially unemployed workers would still be out of work, as would an estimated six million nonworking people who are not included in the unemployment statistics but who most likely would be working or looking for work if the labor market were stronger. Furthermore, if employers had business opportunities that could be profitably pursued by hiring more workers, they would hire more workers. If they could not find people with the exact needed skills, they would hire the next-best candidates \u2014 say, college graduates \u2014 and train them. The fact that hiring and on-the-job training are not robust indicates a lack of business opportunity, not a lack of talent. None of this argues against more and better job training, especially for groups hard hit by unemployment and job discrimination. The real challenge, however, is to create more jobs and lift wages. Congress has the means to do so, including providing more fiscal aid, raising the minimum wage and financing better labor-law enforcement But it has failed to focus on those issues.Advertisement"}

Brazil entered the tournament as a favorite.Projects conceived in boom times stand abandoned, visible symbols of waste and the country\u2019s crippling bureaucracy.In a wide-ranging encounter over canap\u00e9s and wine on the ground floor of the modernist presidential palace, Ms. Rousseff, 66, spoke of the sense of national loss in depth.\u201cI suffered through the game as all Brazilians did,\u201d she said, but she praised the humble manner in which Germany\u2019s players described their victory. When discussing how Brazil could learn from what happened, Ms. Rousseff, a leftist guerrilla during the country\u2019s military dictatorship before becoming an economist, uncharacteristically expressed herself in song.\u201cGet up, shake the dust off, get back on your feet,\u201d she said, singing several verses from \u201cPick Yourself Up,\u201d a samba by Paulo Vanzolini.Ms. Rousseff also pointed out that World Cup victories or losses did not influence election outcomes in recent decades, citing the examples of 2002, when Brazil won the tournament but the candidate of the ruling Social Democrats lost the election, and 1998, when the national team lost in the final to France, but the incumbent, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, won re-election.Going further, Ms. Rousseff said the loss should open the way for a more intense debate over how to improve Brazil\u2019s soccer institutions. She said measures were needed to financially strengthen clubs and training structures so that star players did not have to play abroad, as many of Brazil\u2019s top players now do in Europe.Brazilians explain what it feels like to lose really, really badly.While she is still the front-runner in the election scheduled for October, dissatisfaction with a sluggish economy, which is in its fourth consecutive year of slow growth, has opened her to criticism over her insistence on using a sprawling apparatus of state-controlled companies and banks to guide economic policies.Ms. Rousseff defended her economic record, noting that inequality had diminished during her administration and that of Mr. da Silva, while unemployment had fallen to historic lows. \u201cIn concrete terms, this means your maid has the chance to sit in an airplane and travel to see her parents,\u201d she said, pointing to an example of how incomes have climbed in Brazil this century.Even though she was greeted with jeers by some fans at the opening match of the World Cup a month ago in S\u00e3o Paulo, Ms. Rousseff said she was looking forward to attending the final on Sunday, where she expects to sit with Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Argentina\u2019s president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, was expected to miss the game after her government announced that she had a throat ailment.Ms. Rousseff declined to say whether she was rooting for Germany, which eliminated Brazil from the tournament, or Argentina, a neighbor and Brazil\u2019s biggest historical rival in soccer.\u201cI\u2019m the president of the nation,\u201d she said with a smile, explaining that she felt obligated as a host to treat every visiting team fairly. \u201cI can\u2019t move a muscle in my face to indicate how I feel about this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dutch Higher Education Policy Refocuses on Quality", "Date": "2014-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationTHE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 When the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was deputy minister of education, from 2004 to 2006, the government was committed to the so-called Lisbon Strategy, which aimed to make the European Union a competitive knowledge economy. One goal was that half of the union\u2019s labor force should have had higher education by 2010. The plan largely failed, and European leaders set a new, more modest goal that year: 40 percent of people aged 30 to 34 should be educated to tertiary level by 2020 \u2014 up from 36.8 percent unionwide in 2013, according to Eurostat.In the Netherlands that target had already been reached when it was set. Since then the government has stepped away from numerical objectives. In an interview the current education minister, Jet Bussemaker, said quality now has priority over quantity in higher education.In recent years the realization has grown that enrolling more students in universities and higher vocational training brings with it some drawbacks. In the Netherlands, where the government pays most of the cost of tuition, Mrs. Bussemaker has recently announced a reform in the financing model for tertiary education.The government, a pragmatic coalition of center-right and center-left parties, is working on draft legislation that it hopes will become law by September of next year. The parties \u201chave different backgrounds, but we agree that the current system is not fair and not effective,\u201d Mrs. Bussemaker said in an interview. Dutch students now receive a monthly payment known as a performance grant \u2014 a loan that converts into a grant if the recipient graduates within 10 years. All students qualify for the payment regardless of their financial situation. \u201cStudents that don\u2019t need it, also receive the performance grant,\u201d Mrs. Bussemaker said. In 2003, student funding cost the government 1.3 billion euros, or $1.8 billion. By last year that had risen to almost \u20ac2 billion.The proposed change will replace the performance grant with an expanded option to borrow from the government. Mrs. Bussemaker said her ministry had learned from changes implemented or proposed in countries such as Britain and Australia, featuring rises in tuition fees and sharp increases in student debt. She said the Dutch system was different, with tuition kept low, at \u20ac1,835 a year, compared with fees that have been raised as high as 9,000 pounds, or $15,000, in England. \u201cWe are not going to implement the British system,\u201d she said. Graduates will have 35 years to pay off their loans, up from 15 years now. After graduation, repayments will never be higher than four percent of the graduate\u2019s salary, Mrs. Bussemaker said. \u201cThe advance does not create a loan like a mortgage loan,\u201d she said. Since higher education typically translates into higher earning power \u201cit is an investment in your future,\u201d she added.Mrs. Bussemaker said the change would allow the government to invest in quality of education. The percentage of Dutch 18- to 25-year-olds going into higher education has risen from around 17 percent in the 1980s to 42.8 percent in 2013. \u201cInvestments in education have not kept pace\u201d with growth, she said, promising increased spending on \u201cmeasures that directly benefit students.\u201dStill, the Dutch national students\u2019 union opposes the changes, calling them socially divisive: \u201cEveryone who is talented and motivated to follow an education should be given the opportunity to do that,\u201d said Jorien Janssen, the union\u2019s outgoing president. An existing top-up grant for students from low-income families would be increased under the government\u2019s plans, but not enough to compensate for the loss of the performance grant. \u201cStudents whose parents are not well-off will be most affected,\u201d and are most likely to drop out, Ms. Janssen said.It is hard to predict what effect the planned measures may have on total student numbers. In one survey, 10 percent of students polled said that they would not have started or continued studying under the proposed loan program. Other reports, however, suggest the effect is likely to be more limited. Dutch high-school leavers have a choice of three levels of further education: university; higher professional education; and secondary vocational training, known by the acronym MBO. The Netherlands Institute for Social Research has warned that MBO students, typically from lower income groups, are most likely to be deterred from continuing to higher studies if the performance grant is abolished.But Mrs. Bussemaker argued that a stabilization or fall in the number of students would not necessarily be bad. People with a secondary vocational diploma \u201care qualified and can enter the job market and in many respects there is nothing wrong with that, because we badly need skilled professionals at MBO level,\u201d she said.Harm Beertema, a former secondary vocational teacher who is now an opposition member of parliament for the right-wing Party for Freedom, said he agreed that jobs requiring an MBO diploma were \u201cextraordinary respectable.\u201d Though everyone with the ambition to continue studying should be able to do so, it would be good if more people chose a vocational profession, he said.The need for workers with vocational qualifications was recently reaffirmed by the Scientific Council for Government Policy, a government advisory body. In November, it published a report warning that growth in the number of students in higher education was unlikely to be matched by a shift in the labor market from low-skilled to high-skilled job opportunities. Some graduates \u201cwill inevitably find a job that is scaled lower than their diploma justifies,\u201d it said. Yet despite broad political backing for vocational education, it suffers from a bad image and declining standards. \u201cIn my last year I saw students getting a diploma who would not have passed 15 years before,\u201d said Mr. Beertema, the former teacher. \u201cI\u2019ve seen an absolute level reduction of the goals students had to reach.\u201d He blamed the Lisbon Strategy, which he said had distorted education policy and outcomes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Suspension of a Portuguese Bank\u2019s Shares Shakes the Markets", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European markets have been exuberant for months. Propelled by an improving economic climate, investors have been eager to make bold bets on risky assets like Portuguese bonds, Spanish construction companies and Greek banks.But investors received a jolt on Thursday when shares of Portugal\u2019s second-largest bank, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, were suspended from trading, prompting fears that the bank might need to be rescued. The move sent high-flying stocks and bonds in Portugal plummeting, forced two Spanish companies to suspend bond offerings and brought concerns over the health of Europe\u2019s banking system.As markets from Germany to Greece wobbled, the tumult was a reminder to investors as to how quickly bad news can spread in the euro zone. At a time when the European Central Bank is scrutinizing banks, the problems at Esp\u00edrito Santo are raising fears that there may be unpleasant surprises in banking systems in Greece, Spain and Italy.In short, investors had to own up to the economic reality that Europe \u2014 while on the mend \u2014 is still in a precarious place.\u201cThe credit crisis in the euro zone hasn\u2019t gone away,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. \u201cI hope this fires a shot across the bows of all central banks that says you can\u2019t be complacent here.\u201dOver the last few years, the world\u2019s central banks have pursued extraordinary easy money policies that have stoked a huge appetite for financial assets, driving investors to pile into the riskiest stocks and bonds.But some regulators are concerned that unorthodox bond buying by central banks has created very frothy markets, particularly in high-yielding debt in European and emerging markets. And, as these markets tend to be fairly illiquid, when the selling begins en masse, the broader contagion effect can be punitive.\u201cNo market goes straight up, and we\u2019ve been in markets that have gone straight up,\u201d said Timothy M. Ghriskey of Solaris Asset Management. \u201cThere was bound to be a pullback in pricing to more properly reflect the risks, instead of ignoring them.\u201dInvestors first started to reconsider Europe in the summer of 2012, when Mario Draghi, the central bank president, promised to do whatever it took to preserve the euro. Trust in Mr. Draghi, along with a torrent of available cash resulting from loose central bank policies, has precipitated a significant asset boom in Europe as risk starved investors have piled into securities they had once shunned.The improving economic conditions have only bolstered investor sentiment. Growth, though still weak, has returned to large economies like Spain, driven by robust exports and governments eager to stick with economic reform policies. Even Greece has emerged as an investor darling with tough spending cuts and a small improvement in tax revenue producing a budget surplus last year before accounting for the cost of interest on the government\u2019s debt. But the ebullient markets have largely cloaked the current economic and financial strain. Economists have warned that the root causes of Europe\u2019s misery \u2014 high levels of debt and weak growth \u2014 have not gone away. In Greece, for example, a nascent export recovery hailed by policy makers as a sign that the country was finally becoming more competitive seems to have stalled, with exports down 8 percent in May and 20 percent in April compared with similar periods a year earlier. And unemployment remains stuck at 27 percent.Portugal, despite exiting its bailout program this year, remains caught in a vise of slow growth and persistently high debt levels. According to the most recent report from the International Monetary Fund, Portugal\u2019s debt is 125 percent of its overall economy and the fund forecasts growth this year of 0.8 percent and 1.5 percent next year when it expects the debt levels to gradually start to fall. And while many investors feel the country will be able to finance its debt as long as the markets remain favorable, others are betting that once central banks pull back and interest rates start to rise again, dubious borrowers such as Portugal will be cut off again from the markets and forced to restructure their debt.\u201cThere are doubts that Italy is out of the recession, France is going nowhere and Germany is growing at 1 percent,\u201d said Edward Hugh, an independent economist based in Spain. \u201cSo the euro area grows at 1 percent this year if you are lucky and who knows what is going to happen next year.\u201dOn Thursday, the problems were localized.Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo saw its shares plummet nearly 20 percent on Thursday before being suspended from trading by Portuguese regulators. Investors are increasingly worried about the bank\u2019s health after its parent company, Esp\u00edrito Santo International, said that it had missed payments on some of its debt.The bank\u2019s stock has been under pressure since late May after the disclosure that an audit by the Bank of Portugal found that Esp\u00edrito Santo International was in \u201cserious financial condition.\u201d The parent company disclosed that the audit had identified \u201cmaterial irregularities\u201d in its financial statements, including \u201comissions in the accounting of liabilities,\u201d overvaluation of certain assets and inadequate record keeping.While the problems may remain isolated, the fears of more endemic problems were enough to scare markets on Thursday.The Euro Stoxx 50 index of European stocks was off more than 1.6 percent, and Portugal\u2019s main stock index fell 4.2 percent. The weakness spread to the United States, where the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index each closed down less than 1 percent after an early sell-off.In the market turmoil, yields on Portuguese and Greek bonds spiked. Investor appetite for a Greek debt offering was diminished. In Spain, the construction conglomerate Grupo A.C.S., one of Europe\u2019s most indebted corporations, was forced to postpone to a bond sale along with Banco Popular, a midsize Spanish bank. An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the incoming chief executive of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo. He is V\u00edtor Bento, not \u201cV\u00edtor Bento Moreira Rato.\u201d (Moreira Rato is the name of another expected new bank executive.)An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money Greece raised in a sale of three-year bonds.

{"Headline": "Greece Plans Another Bond Offering", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Three months after returning to international bond markets following a long exile, Greece said on Wednesday that it was planning to sell bonds again in an effort to capitalize on the growing demand for short-term euro zone debt.After a successful issue of five-year bonds in April, Greece said it would sell three-year bonds \u201cin the near future.\u201d A statement by Greece\u2019s Finance Ministry provided no details about the size or exact timing of the debt offering, but Greek news media said the sale, which would begin Thursday morning, would try to raise 2.5 billion to 3 billion euros, or $3.4 billion to $4.1 billion, and that the bonds would pay an interest rate of less than 3.5 percent.Greece plans to use the proceeds from the sale, which will adhere to British law, to finance the repayment of \u20ac6 billion of debt maturing next month.The fresh call for funds comes as investors looking for better returns flock to the higher-paying debt of countries like Greece. This month, Portugal and Ireland, both of which recently emerged from their international bailouts, made new forays into capital markets.Analysts said that three-year bonds were not common but that the choice of such debt was in keeping with Greece\u2019s desire to build demand for its short-, medium- and long-term debt. \u201cThe Greeks are trying to build confidence along the yield curve,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, a director at the London-based Eurasia Group. \u201cThe three-year bond issue speaks to that strategy.\u201dBut the new bond offering is not without risks, according to Mr. Rahman, who described it as a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d\u201cIt allows the government to claim the domestic crisis is over, but it will reduce creditor appetite to extend Greece debt relief later this year,\u201d Mr. Rahman said, referring to talks with international creditors over lightening the country\u2019s huge debt burden, which is expected to be about 174 percent of gross domestic product this year.The new Greek offering also comes as inspectors representing the country\u2019s troika of international lenders \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 returned to Athens for a new review of the country\u2019s efforts to overhaul its economy and public administration.Greece\u2019s new finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, who was installed last month as part of a cabinet reassignment by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, is set to hold his first meeting with troika inspectors on Thursday.The talks are expected to focus on the overhauls Greece has agreed to push through in return for more rescue funding, like transforming the country\u2019s dysfunctional tax collection system, and the planned partial privatization of the electricity utility, which has prompted worker strikes, power cuts and calls by the political opposition for the changes to be put to a referendum.Another issue expected to dominate talks is a rash of rulings by Greek courts that overturn measures dictated by the troika, like layoffs of civil servants and cuts to salaries and pensions. A failure to put those measures into effect is expected to punch a hole in Greece\u2019s finances, and inspectors for the international creditors are likely to demand that savings be found elsewhere.But, according to Mr. Rahman, a successful bond issue could be used as \u201ca bargaining chip\u201d by the government to push back on the overhauls sought by the troika.Underlining their opposition to the proposed overhauls, Greek civil servants walked off the job on Wednesday, disrupting public services at hospitals and other institutions.Although Greece is expected to return to growth this year after a crippling six-year recession, the impact of austerity measures has pushed unemployment up to around 27 percent and decimated incomes.International creditors have provided Greece with two bailouts worth a total of \u20ac240 billion since 2010, meting out the loans in installments in exchange for the painful economic measures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strong Growth in G.D.P., but Some Caveats", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe G.D.P. ReportBut there are some caveats. What drove the sharp expansion, and what does it mean for the future? These charts help explain it.First, here\u2019s the overall growth number. As it shows, the 4 percent rate of economic expansion in the April-through-June quarter was the strongest since last summer and the third-strongest quarter in the expansion that began five years ago.But there is an important qualifier. Of the 4 percent reported growth, 1.66 percentage points was attributable to businesses increasing their inventories. But when companies make more goods that end up on store shelves or in warehouses (and not because they\u2019re selling more stuff), that doesn\u2019t tell us much about the future of the economy. So economists often look at \u201cfinal sales,\u201d excluding inventory effects, to get a sense of the true underlying pace of growth.It shows a much less volatile pattern over the last few quarters. By that measure, the first quarter was not quite so gloomy (with the economy shrinking at only a -0.9 percent rate) and the second quarter not nearly so sunny (that big 4 percent growth headline gets cut down to size, to 2.3 percent).So inventories are a major part of the second-quarter story. But where else is the growth in G.D.P. coming from? For that, take a look at what different sectors contributed to overall growth.Aside from inventories, the other major driver of expansion in the spring was from personal consumption expenditures. This accounts for around two-thirds of the economy, so it unsurprisingly accounted for the majority of economic growth.Within personal consumption, the growth was broad, coming both from durable goods (like cars), nondurable goods (like clothing) and services (like health care). Meanwhile, business investment and housing investment were both positive but modest, and trade was a net subtracter from growth, as imports rose faster than exports. Government kicked in a small contribution to growth, as expansion in state and local spending made up for a contraction in federal spending.But sometimes looking at the quarter-to-quarter variations in the G.D.P. numbers can create a misleading view of the underlying trends. Looking at the rate of growth over a full year can provide a more accurate and useful picture of how the economy is doing.By this measure, the expansion of the last few years looks a great deal more steady. The nation\u2019s economic output has expanded by around 2 percent a year, with a high of 3.1 percent in the year that ended in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a low of 1.2 percent in the year that ended in the third quarter of 2011. The latest reading on the spring of this year is squarely within that range, with the expansion clocking in at 2.4 percent over the last 12 months.That growth rate would be just fine in normal times, when the economy is humming along with full employment. But it\u2019s disappointing given that the economy still appears to be functioning below its potential, with unemployment high and businesses still not producing at full capacity.By the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimates, in fact, the level of output reported for the second quarter is still $770 billion below the nation\u2019s current economic potential, or 4.2 percent below. That implies that the nation still has plenty of room to grow if a faster expansion ever kicks in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eni Chief Angers Unions With Plan to Close Refineries", "Date": "2014-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The new chief executive of Eni, the Italian energy giant, has put himself on a collision course with workers and possibly the Italian government with a plan to close much of the company\u2019s unprofitable refinery network in Italy.Claudio Descalzi, who was named chief executive in May, has told union leaders that the refineries most likely to be closed are those at Gela in Sicily, Taranto in the Puglia region, and Livorno in Tuscany, according to local news reports. Together they account for about 40 percent of Eni\u2019s refining capacity in Italy and employ more than 1,500 people.Beside taking on the unions, Mr. Descalzi must secure the approval of the body that appointed him, the Italian government, which owns a 30 percent controlling stake in Eni.Union leaders were quick to condemn Mr. Descalzi\u2019s plans.\u201cEni\u2019s strategy could cripple the refinery sector,\u201d said Luigi Ulgiati, secretary general of the chemical workers\u2019 division of the General Labor Union, known as the U.G.L. for its initials in Italian, according to the Italian news agency ANSA. \u201cThe government must step in because we risk de-industrializing the country and creating mass unemployment in the name of debatable notions of efficiency.\u201dAccording to local news reports, workers at the Gela refinery have staged protests, including the seizure on Wednesday of a terminal that receives natural gas from Libya.But some financial analysts say that Mr. Descalzi\u2019s proposal is long overdue, one that should be emulated by other European energy companies.Mr. Descalzi \u201cmay emerge as a male Italian version of Margaret Thatcher by going up against the unions,\u201d analysts at Bernstein Research wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.Eni\u2019s refineries are an unwanted legacy for a company that over the past few years has been shifting to the more lucrative business of finding and producing oil and natural gas. Mr. Descalzi led Eni\u2019s exploration and production unit under his predecessor as chief executive, Paolo Scaroni, when the company made large discoveries off Mozambique and Norway, among other places.With demand for petroleum products falling, the Eni unit that refines crude oil has lost an average of more than 100 million euros, or about $136 million, each quarter since 2009. The marketing side of the business is profitable, partly offsetting the losses.Those losses are thought to have amounted to \u20ac800 million last year alone and are likely to continue. Demand for refined products in Italy is continuing to fall, and Eni\u2019s refineries are not as efficient as those of rivals, according to Bernstein.Eni\u2019s competitors face many of the same pressures. European refiners are being squeezed by weak economies; competition from United States refiners, which have access to cheaper oil and gas from shale; and new, more efficient refineries in the Middle East and Asia.Industry executives and analysts agree that Europe has too much capacity, but it is politically difficult to shut refineries and lay off workers, often in regions that are already hurting from declines in other industries.So far, the protests against Mr. Descalzi\u2019s plans have been relatively minor. Eni may try to appease the affected workers by offering them jobs elsewhere in the company, and by converting refinery sites to logistics depots or to serve other uses. A refinery at Venice, for example, has already been converted to process biofuels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Road Work Made Possible by Underfunding Pensions", "Date": "2014-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTheir Way or No HighwayThe Federal Highway Trust Fund is expected to run out of money in August. So, naturally, Congress is debating a temporary fix that involves letting corporations underfund their pension systems.Of course, we could replenish the fund by raising the federal gasoline tax, which is its primary source of financing. That\u2019s what Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, want to do. But increasing gas taxes is unpopular, so Congress hasn\u2019t done so since 1993, which means that the tax on gas has actually fallen 39 percent over the last 21 years after you adjust for inflation. Instead, Congress has used a series of gimmicks and shifts to keep the fund solvent as highway construction costs have risen.The latest proposal, which passed the Republican-controlled House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday, works like this: If you change corporate pension funding rules to let companies set aside less money today to pay for future benefits, they will report higher taxable profits. And if they have higher taxable profits, they will pay more in taxes over the 10-year budget window that Congress uses to write laws. Those added taxes can be diverted to the Federal Highway Trust Fund. Unfortunately, this gimmick will also result in corporations paying less in taxes in later years, when they have to make up for the pension payments they\u2019re missing now. But if it happens more than 10 years in the future, it doesn\u2019t count in Congress\u2019s method for calculating budget balance. \u201cFiscal responsibility,\u201d as popularly defined in Washington, ignores anything that happens after 2024.Letting companies underfund pensions so they pay more taxes is a dumb idea, but it\u2019s not a new one: A similar strategy was part of the last bipartisan highway bill, which passed in 2012. The new proposal would simply extend the underfunding that was already allowed in the 2012 bill for a greater number of years.This is wishful math. Low long-term interest rates are not artificial; they reflect an expectation that the Federal Reserve will keep rates unusually low for a long time, and that economic growth will be relatively weak and uncertain. That, in turn, means that returns on safe investments like bonds will continue to be below historical averages, and that corporate pension funds still won\u2019t get the safe, high returns they used to enjoy. If companies are allowed to put less money into their pension funds in that environment, the funds will deplete over time, and the companies will just have to pay more later \u2014 unless they go bankrupt, in which case a federal agency (the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) will be on the hook to pay retirees.But even if my prediction is wrong, a change to corporate pension policy is a bad way to pay for highways. Let\u2019s say the companies are correct \u2014 that low long-term interest rates do not reflect fundamentals, and that interest rates will rise soon, showing that corporate pension plans have really been overfunded all along. If that\u2019s true, adjusting the rules now will simply create tax revenue that would otherwise come in later when interest rates rise, allowing companies to cut their pension contributions naturally. It does nothing to substantively affect the long-term fiscal position of the federal government, or to make more funds available to pay for highways into the distant future. And that\u2019s something everybody in Congress knows: The hunt for \u201cpay-fors\u201d \u2014 deficit-cutting measures to offset things like replenishing the Highway Trust Fund \u2014 is not so much about keeping the economy strong. It\u2019s more about being able to announce that the Congressional Budget Office said your plan wouldn\u2019t raise the deficit over the next 10 years. That works even if, as with the latest Republican proposal, you take all the added corporate tax revenue over the 10-year window to keep the Highway Trust Fund solvent for just five additional months. Yes, even if we run with this gimmick, Congress will be back in January, trying to find a way to claw the fund out of insolvency again.Raising the gas tax and indexing it to inflation would be a fine way to fix the perennial shortfall in the fund without increasing the deficit. But there is another perfectly valid option: replenishing the fund by borrowing money. Interest rates are low, investors are clamoring to lend money to the United States and federal debt is projected to be a stable share of the economy over the next 10 years. This is a good time to borrow money and to spend the proceeds on useful highway construction.Yet instead, Congress is debating whether it should \u2014 again \u2014 let corporations underfund their pension plans, and generate a one-time boost in tax revenue. And Congress would use that revenue to fund a few months of a continuing spending program that it does not have a plan to make permanently solvent, while exposing pension beneficiaries and taxpayers to risk if a corporation goes bankrupt after underfunding its pension plan.If you define \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d solely in terms of whether the federal budget deficit grows or shrinks over a 10-year window, you can reach the conclusion that the foregoing plan serves the goal of \u201cfiscal responsibility.\u201d Which only goes to show that politicians in both parties have settled on an insane definition of \u201cfiscal responsibility.\u201dThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life: nytimes.com/upshot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Sees a Recovery, on Paper", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Ou Chengbi, a butcher at a sweltering open-air market on the outskirts of Guangzhou in southeastern China, can scarcely see signs of recovery in her country\u2019s economy. Dripping with perspiration near unrefrigerated slabs of beef in her stall, she described how as recently as last winter she could still chop up an entire cow each day and sell it all.\u201cNow I can only sell half a cow a day,\u201d she said.Millions of Chinese merchants like Ms. Ou seem to be struggling, even as data suggests growth is stabilizing.The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing announced on Wednesday that economic growth climbed 7.5 percent in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier. But independent surveys of businesses across China show that in sector after sector, sales and confidence are still deteriorating.\u201cAll of them are pointing in the opposite direction from this supposed G.D.P. number,\u201d said Leland Miller, the president of China Beige Book International, a New York data service that surveys 2,200 private businesses across China each quarter to gauge economic activity.One of the biggest engines of Chinese economic growth in recent years \u2014 construction and other investment in the private sector \u2014 is sputtering, while exports have only begun to recover from a weak winter and retail sales growth is leveling off. That leaves government investment and spending, which are running strong, propelled by redoubled lending this spring by the state-controlled banking system to the national railroad system, local governments and state-owned enterprises.The result has been frenzied spending on the construction of railroad lines \u2014 up 32.1 percent in June from a year earlier \u2014 and subsidized housing. Steel output in China is setting records by tonnage as a result, even as the number of housing starts in the private sector is falling steeply.Total lending has now risen faster than economic output, even before adjusting for inflation, in every quarter since late 2011. Lending accelerated further in June, according to figures released on Tuesday by the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China. Yet Mr. Miller\u2019s survey and others show that private businesses are becoming less and less interested in borrowing money because they see few opportunities to invest it profitably.\u201cWe have not felt any improvement in our business since the beginning of the year,\u201d said Wan Yanhong, the business manager at the Nanchang Zerowatt Electric Appliance Company in Nanchang, in south-central China.\u201cGenerally speaking, comparing recent months to the same period last year, business has been very slow and very quiet,\u201d said Kay Lam, the manager of UB Office Systems, an office furniture store in Guangzhou.Chinese officials have repeatedly called for rebalancing the economy, encouraging more spending by households, which save nearly half their incomes, and less dependence on debt-financed investment projects. But each time growth starts to fall below the official target of roughly 7.5 percent \u2014 as it did in the first quarter, when it was 7.4 percent \u2014 the government quickly opens the spigots for further credit.Some economists inside and outside the government contend that China has a choice: Slow down the lending and accept steady declines in economic growth each year, or continue heavy lending and risk a sharp drop in economic growth someday when the financial system begins to teeter. \u201cAlthough there is no way to predict with accuracy and certainty the point at which China will reach the limits of its debt capacity, I believe that current rates of credit expansion can continue at most for another 3-4 years,\u201d Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management, wrote in his newsletter after the release of the data.China\u2019s economic outlook retains pockets of long-term strength. One of them is that tens of millions of Chinese workers have more money to spend each year. The data Wednesday showed that average wages for migrant workers were up 10.6 percent this summer from a year ago. That was nearly five times the increase in consumer prices over the last year, at just 2.3 percent.Xu Hua, a graying, unshaven man wearing shorts and no shirt, strained to carry a succession of enormous white sacks of rice on Wednesday from a delivery van into a Guangzhou restaurant. But he said the task paid better than it did a year ago. He and a co-worker each earned 50 renminbi, or $8.10, for more than two hours of unloading the truck; they earned 40 renminbi for the same job a year ago, Mr. Xu said.\u201cWho is willing to do this anymore?\u201d he added.Consumer retail sales are also growing strongly, up 12.4 percent in June from a year earlier, according to government figures released on Wednesday. That nearly matches a pace of 12.5 percent in May.But that has not been fast enough to offset the effects on the economy of a deceleration in private sector investment, including a 14 percent drop in housing starts in June compared with a year earlier. Prices for new apartments have dropped in some cities, and the number of transactions has slumped.Most economists say Chinese households have the financial strength to step up spending faster than their incomes by reducing their prodigious savings rates. But for revenue, the Chinese government relies heavily on steep value-added taxes that penalize consumption, while a faltering housing market has damaged confidence.\u201cThere are fewer people even coming in to look,\u201d said Deng Weiping, a wholesaler at a fabric market in Guangzhou. \u201cAnd the people who do come in buy less than before.\u201dHilda Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The Partnership for a New American Economy is also placing pro-immigration ads on the CNN channel in terminals and some of the lounges at Dulles International Airport and Ronald Reagan National Airport.Prices can vary. Ms. Senese said that some groups had placed posters in a key Metro station for four weeks for less than $1,000, and that other groups had spent as much as $200,000 in a month.\u201cThe advantage to running the Metro ads in D.C. was we would reach key influencers and we would also reach the general public, who would be motivated to take grass-roots action,\u201d said Michael Robbins, the managing director for government and public affairs at the association.\u201cWe\u2019re bringing our message directly to where the decision makers, to where the influential, are,\u201d said Melinda Pierce, the legislative director of the Sierra Club.So, will the Sierra Club be showing ads in the back of taxis anytime soon?\u201cOf course, we enviros are hoping half of those folks are also taking Metro,\u201d Ms. Pierce joked.Advertisement"}

He was 56.The cause was renal cell cancer, said his brother, Steven.Mr. Stout, an associate in Frank Gehry\u2019s office before establishing his own firm in 1996 in Los Angeles, explored the relationship between architecture and energy in holistic designs that were no less sculptural and humane for being ecologically responsible. Sustainability helped shape form. He started his firm with a series of internationally admired commissions for energy plants, fire stations and sports centers in Germany. The structures \u2014 turbulent forms and canyonesque spaces, with sculptural solids juxtaposed against light-filled voids \u2014 were often built on tight budgets using inexpensive, energy-smart materials. His museums project a strong civic presence, inviting visitors inside with welcoming architectural gestures and quiet, luminous galleries. The designs helped put the museums on the national cultural map, lifted local economies and conserved energy. The complexity of his geysers of space, eruptions of form and collages of disparate materials was not just for the sake of complexity, Mr. Stout made clear. His open system of design reflected the client\u2019s input, the building\u2019s site, the budget Mr. Stout had to work with and the project\u2019s physical and historical context. He also found inspiration in the jagged natural forms and weatherworn walls of the canyons and mountains in which he frequently hiked. His structures could look as natural as the cliffs he climbed. \u201cHe believed, as many great architects do, in architecture as a spiritual calling, not just a profession,\u201d said Marcy Goodwin of M. Goodwin Museum Planning, a Los Angeles consulting firm. Mr. Stout worked with her on a dozen large-scale museum planning projects, including the master plan of the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh. \u201cIn the best of Randall\u2019s work, the parts soar, a combination of solids and glassy forms that fuse into architectural icebergs that seem levitated over the podium of the building,\u201d Ms. Goodwin said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd the mass all seems to flow, to move. But within the drama, he always made the entrance clear. You knew where the front door was.\u201d Randall Paul Stout was born on May 6, 1958, in Knoxville, Tenn. His mother was a high school science teacher in Knoxville; his father worked in wholesale sales for a dairy there. While attending the University of Tennessee, Mr. Stout worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority in the architecture design department. He graduated in 1981 and went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in architecture from Rice University in Houston, where he was hired by the Houston office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. He joined the Gehry firm in Los Angeles in 1989 and as a senior associate worked with Mr. Gehry for seven years on projects that included the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany, and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.At his death Mr. Stout was an associate professor in the architecture school at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.Even after decades in Southern California, he never lost his courtly Southern manner, which served him well professionally, Ms. Goodwin said. \u201cHe was sort of bilingual,\u201d she said, \u201cand could switch back and forth from a straight American accent to a drawl, as necessary.\u201d Besides his brother, he is survived by his wife, Joelle; their children Colton, Logan and Grace; his mother, Gloria Mynatt Stout; and his sister, Marcie Stout Wasson. While being treated for cancer for 2 \u00bd years, Mr. Stout continued to come into the office to complete his last project, a bridge for pedestrians over the Trinity River in Fort Worth.

Despite their often vocal criticism of these behemoths, people in the region are some of the most active and loyal users of American social networks, search engines and e-commerce websites. They are often even more hooked on the services than Americans are.American tech companies operate seven of the 10 most visited websites in Europe, according to comScore statistics. Only Yandex and Mail.ru, a Russian search engine and an email site, and Axel Springer, the German publisher of Die Welt and Bild, make the list.Nonetheless, from Spain to Sweden, many of Europe\u2019s millions of Internet users regularly complain about the dominance of American tech companies, particularly about how their data is used and shared. It also leaves them wondering why so few homegrown tech companies are globally competitive.For many Europeans, the likes of Twitter and Amazon hold too much information about what people do online. That wariness has only grown stronger after the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about American intelligence agencies\u2019 spying activities and perceived easy access to the world\u2019s tech infrastructure.In some ways, Europeans are pushing back.Last month, Google started removing some links to online search results after Europe\u2019s highest court ruled that the company had to give people the right to request that information be taken down.And the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is finishing new rules \u2014 tougher than those currently in force in the United States \u2014 intended to strengthen the region\u2019s privacy protections for online data.But leave the clutches of the services they deride? No.For Stuart Turnbull, 42, a writer who lives two hours north of Edinburgh, a reliance on American tech companies has become the cost of doing business.Mr. Turnbull once tried to shut down his Facebook account after realizing that he was spending too much time sharing posts and comments. Yet as he looked to build contacts with other writers and editors around the world, Mr. Turnbull, who works from a home office in the small town of Crieff, soon changed his mind. He even opened a second Facebook account dedicated to his literary career.While he remains concerned about how tech companies use his online data, the ability to tap into the global networks offered by the likes of Facebook and Twitter is too enticing a prospect to turn down.\u201cI accept that my data may be mined,\u201d said Mr. Turnbull, who says he is more worried about companies\u2019 potentially abusing his information than about governments\u2019 getting access to his online data. \u201cIt\u2019s the price you pay for using these so-called free services.\u201dIn many ways, the American companies face little competition. For example, several regional e-commerce sites like the British fashion company ASOS have challenged Amazon but have yet to compete with the breadth of products \u2014 and discounts \u2014 offered by the American company.European social networks, particularly in Germany, once dominated online communication but gradually fell out of favor as Facebook\u2019s global reach grew.Government efforts, including a French plan to create a state-backed search engine to compete with Google, have also failed to take off.But not every European has succumbed to the dominance of the American tech companies.Six months ago, Russell Albert, a 43-year-old British software engineer, started thinking that the ads displayed next to his Google search results were too closely based on his Internet search history. He switched to using smaller, lesser-known search engines and began looking for alternatives to other Google products, like its popular email service.Surfing the web may not be as easy with these other services, Mr. Albert said, but he is still glad he switched. \u201cI hated being completely Googled up,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided that I didn\u2019t want to have all my eggs in just one basket.\u201dAmong them is Lara Goldsworthy, a 31-year-old marketing manager from Hamburg, Germany.\u201cWhatsApp would have been the first service that I would have left, but I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Ms. Goldsworthy, who added that many of her German friends \u2014 seemingly without irony \u2014 took to Facebook to complain about the social network\u2019s acquisition of the messaging service.\u201cI realized,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I had given up my privacy a long time ago.\u201dAdvertisement"}

First, we said goodbye to imperialism and colonialism and all their methods of controlling territory. Then we said goodbye to the Cold War alliance system, which propped up many weak and newly independent states with money to build infrastructure and to buy weapons to control their borders and people \u2014 because the stability of every square in the global chessboard mattered to Washington and Moscow. And, lately, we\u2019ve been saying goodbye to top-down, iron-fisted monarchies and autocracies, which have been challenged by massively urbanized, technologically empowered citizens.So, today, you have three basic systems: order provided by democratic, inclusive governments; order imposed by autocratic exclusivist governments; and ungoverned, or chaotically governed, spaces, where rickety failed states, militias, tribes, pirates and gangs contest one another for control, but there is no single power center to answer the phone \u2014 or, if they do, it falls off the wall. Look around: Boko Haram in Nigeria kidnaps 250 schoolgirls and then disappears into a dark corner of that country. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, a ragtag jihadist militia, carves out a caliphate inside Syria and Iraq and boasts on Twitter of beheading opponents. NATO decapitates Libya\u2019s regime and sets loose a tribal-militia war of all against all, which, when combined with the crackup of Chad, spills arms and refugees across African borders, threatening Tunisia and Morocco. Israel has been flooded with more than 50,000 Eritreans and Sudanese refugees, who crossed the Sinai Desert by foot, bus or car looking for work and security in Israel\u2019s \u201cisland of order.\u201d And, just since October, the U.S. has been flooded with more than 50,000 unaccompanied children from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. \u201cThey\u2019re fleeing from threats and violence in their home countries,\u201d noted Vox.com, \u201cwhere things have gotten so bad that many families believe that they have no choice but to send their children on the long, dangerous journey north.\u201dYes, we blew up Iraq, but you can\u2019t understand the uprising in Syria unless you understand how a horrendous four-year drought there, coupled with a demographic explosion, undermined its economy. You can\u2019t understand Egypt\u2019s uprising without linking it to the 2010 global wheat crisis and soaring bread prices, which inspired the anti-Hosni Mubarak chant: \u201cBread, Freedom, Dignity.\u201d You also can\u2019t understand Egypt\u2019s stress without understanding the challenge that China\u2019s huge labor pool poses in a globalized world to every other low-wage country.

In a flat world, people can see faster than ever how far behind they are and organize faster than ever to protest.

Representative Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, is a prime current example. But maybe the joke\u2019s on us. After all, such people often dominate policy discourse. And what policy makers don\u2019t know, or worse, what they think they know that isn\u2019t so, can definitely hurt you. This was certainly true of the most recent poll, which asked whether the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \u2014 the Obama \u201cstimulus\u201d \u2014 reduced unemployment. All but one of those who responded said that it did, a vote of 36 to 1. A follow-up question on whether the stimulus was worth it produced a slightly weaker but still overwhelming 25 to 2 consensus.Leave aside for a moment the question of whether the panel is right in this case (although it is). Let me ask, instead, whether you knew that the pro-stimulus consensus among experts was this strong, or whether you even knew that such a consensus existed. More important, over the past several years policy makers across the Western world have pretty much ignored the professional consensus on government spending and everything else, placing their faith instead in doctrines most economists firmly reject. Am I saying that the professional consensus is always right? No. But when politicians pick and choose which experts \u2014 or, in many cases, \u201cexperts\u201d \u2014 to believe, the odds are that they will choose badly. Moreover, experience shows that there is no accountability in such matters. Bear in mind that the American right is still taking its economic advice mainly from people who have spent many years wrongly predicting runaway inflation and a collapsing dollar.All of which raises a troubling question: Are we as societies even capable of taking good policy advice?Economists used to assert confidently that nothing like the Great Depression could happen again. After all, we know far more than our great-grandfathers did about the causes of and cures for slumps, so how could we fail to do better? When crises struck, however, much of what we\u2019ve learned over the past 80 years was simply tossed aside. And macroeconomics, of course, isn\u2019t the only challenge we face. In fact, it should be easy compared with many other issues that need to be addressed with specialized knowledge, above all climate change. So you really have to wonder whether and how we\u2019ll avoid disaster. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Parliament Advances a National Minimum Wage", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The lower house of the German Parliament voted to establish a national minimum wage for the first time on Thursday \u2014 8.50 euros (about $11.60) an hour \u2014 to take effect next year. Some lawmakers hailed the step as historic.Setting a minimum wage was a major element of the agreement Chancellor Angela Merkel, the leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union party, struck last November to assemble a governing coalition and remain in power. The Social Democratic party insisted on the step as one of its conditions for joining the government. Many German businesspeople, who tend to support the Christian Democrats, opposed it, arguing that setting a minimum wage would deter hiring, particularly in struggling areas of the former East Germany.In the end, the measure passed the lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, in the last session before the summer break, on a vote of 535 to 5 with 61 abstentions. Leaders of all parties in the chamber except Die Linke, a far-left party, backed the measure. The upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, which represents Germany\u2019s 16 states, is expected to give its approval next week.Germany was the last major European economy without a national minimum wage. Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the Social Democrats and the deputy chancellor in the coalition government, spoke of a \u201chistoric day.\u201d\u201cFor far too long, the ideas of industrywide wage agreements, fair wages, workers\u2019 involvement in running companies and trade unions were contested,\u201d he said. \u201cToday is a turning point in that development.\u201dHis party said that about 3.7 million people would benefit from a raise as a result of the law. It will eventually cover nearly all workers, but for certain industries with existing wage agreements, it will not apply until 2016. A national commission to be formed by 2017 will decide whether to increase the minimum the following year.There are also some exceptions for those under 18, intended to protect Germany\u2019s vaunted system of apprenticeships, and for people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more, intended to encourage businesses to hire them.Another measure that the Social Democrats insisted upon when joining the coalition government \u2014 lowering the minimum age for retirement on a full pension to 63 \u2014 took effect for some workers this week.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this story referred incorrectly to the lower house of the German Parliament.

{"Headline": "Eurozone Growth Rebounds in July", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The eurozone economy continues its slow recovery, but worries about the Ukraine crisis have begun to cloud the outlook, according to the results of a private-sector survey released on Thursday.After slowing in June, eurozone economic growth rebounded in July to its strongest level in three months, according to a survey of purchasing managers across the 18 nations that share the euro currency, conducted by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm.Markit\u2019s composite index rose to 54.0 from 52.8 in June, remaining comfortably above the level of 50 that signals growth. Separate indexes measuring activity in services and manufacturing also rose.But Markit noted that growth in new orders appeared to have been weighed down by concerns about the standoff in eastern Ukraine, which has raised the possibility of tougher new sanctions on Russia, a major trade partner of the European Union, and thus potentially fewer sales of eurozone goods.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a growing number of companies reporting that their orders are down or that their outlooks for the year have deteriorated because of the Ukraine situation,\u201d Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, said.While \u201cthe numbers are not huge,\u201d he added, it is worth noting that much of the latest survey was completed before the Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down on July 17, and it would not be surprising if the August data are more pessimistic.Volker Treier, deputy head of the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, noted that Russia ranks among Germany\u2019s 10 largest trading partners, and that 300,000 German jobs depend on exports to Russia.\u201cWe had been expecting exports to Russia to rise by around 6 percent this year,\u201d Mr. Treier said, but that was revised down to a 10 percent contraction after the first sanctions against Russia were announced.President Obama imposed a new round of sanctions against Russia on July 16, and the European Union this week began weighing a tougher series of measures that could include restricting Moscow\u2019s ability to use European capital markets and limiting sales of technology for its energy industry.\u201cNow, with a new phase of sanctions,\u201d Mr. Treier said, the export decline \u201cwill be more, maybe 15 percent.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t only affect German exporters, but the whole European economy,\u201d he said.Also Thursday Spain, one of the countries worst hit by the euro debt crisis, got unexpectedly good news from its jobs market, as its unemployment rate fell to 24.5 percent in the second quarter, from 25.9 percent in the first quarter, according to data released by the national statistics institute. The second-quarter data also showed Spain had its highest rate of job creation since the 2008 start of the financial crisis.The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chips gained almost 1 percent in afternoon trading after the report, which is one of the most closely watched \u201creal-time\u201d indicators of the eurozone economy. The euro was little changed against the dollar, trading at $1.3474.The rise in business activity suggests that the eurozone economy is growing at \u201cone of the strongest rates we have seen in the past three years,\u201d Mr. Williamson said in a statement.Still, he said, the survey data suggest that the region\u2019s gross domestic product \u201cis expanding at a modest pace of approximately 0.4 percent per quarter.\u201d\u201cPart of the weakness of growth can be attributed to geopolitical concerns,\u201d Mr. Williamson wrote, \u201cand notably worries about the potential economic impact of the escalating situation in Ukraine.\u201d He added: \u201cThe likelihood is that companies will become increasingly reluctant to commit to making big decisions on purchases, investment and hiring in the face of such economic uncertainty, suggesting growth could weaken again.\u201dConsistent with recent reports, the survey of purchasing managers suggested the French economy was stagnating \u201cat best,\u201d while the German economy, Europe\u2019s biggest, was improving.And there were more signs of life in the so-called \u201cperipheral\u201d eurozone nations, where Markit said business activity appeared to be on the rise at the fastest pace since 2007.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Addicted to Inflation", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first step toward recovery is admitting that you have a problem. That goes for political movements as well as individuals. So I have some advice for so-called reform conservatives trying to rebuild the intellectual vitality of the right: You need to start by facing up to the fact that your movement is in the grip of some uncontrollable urges. In particular, it\u2019s addicted to inflation \u2014 not the thing itself, but the claim that runaway inflation is either happening or about to happen.Rick Santelli, one of the network\u2019s stars, is best known for a rant against debt relief that arguably gave birth to the Tea Party. On this occasion, however, he was ranting about another of his favorite subjects, the allegedly inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve. And his colleague Steve Liesman had had enough. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for you to have been more wrong,\u201d Mr. Liesman declared, and he went on to detail the wrong predictions: \u201cThe higher interest rates never came, the inability of the U.S. to sell bonds never happened, the dollar never crashed, Rick. There isn\u2019t a single one that\u2019s worked for you.\u201dYou could say the same thing about many people. I\u2019ve had conversations with investors bemused by the failure of the dollar to crash and inflation to soar, because \u201call the experts\u201d said that was going to happen. And that is indeed what you might have imagined if your notion of expertise was what you saw on CNBC, on The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page, or in Forbes. And this has been going on for a long time \u2014 at least since early 2009. Yet despite being consistently wrong for more than five years, these \u201cexperts\u201d never consider the possibility that there might be something amiss with their economic framework, let alone that Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen or, for that matter, yours truly might have been right to dismiss their warnings.All of this is very frustrating to those reform conservatives. If you ask what new ideas they have to offer, they often mention \u201cmarket monetarism,\u201d which translates under current circumstances to the notion that the Fed should be doing more, not less. More generally, modern American conservatism is deeply opposed to any form of government activism, and while monetary policy is sometimes treated as a technocratic affair, the truth is that printing dollars to fight a slump, or even to stabilize some broader definition of the money supply, is indeed an activist policy.The point, then, is that inflation addiction is telling us something about the intellectual state of one side of our great national divide. The right\u2019s obsessive focus on a problem we don\u2019t have, its refusal to reconsider its premises despite overwhelming practical failure, tells you that we aren\u2019t actually having any kind of rational debate. And that, in turn, bodes ill not just for would-be reformers, but for the nation. Advertisement"}

On Monday, an international court ordered Russia to pay more than $50 billion to a group of investors for the expropriation of Yukos, the now-defunct oil company. The court ruled as European countries considered imposing sanctions on trade in defense, technology and other goods and restricting access to European capital markets for Russia\u2019s state-owned companies. Later Monday, the United States and Europe agreed to stiffer sanctions.Mr. Pavlik said while most investors had focused on the improving economy, the conflicts had the potential to rattle markets. \u201cI think the market is doing what it should be doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting sucked into all the bad news out there.

The House of Representatives had voted earlier in the week to repeal the unpopular measure, which has been a highly contentious issue in Australian politics for seven years.The tax was devised to penalize hundreds of Australia\u2019s biggest producers of carbon emissions, setting a price of 23 Australian dollars, or $21.50, per metric ton of carbon dioxide when it was put into effect in 2012 under then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard of the Labor Party, which is now in the opposition. The price rose to 25 Australian dollars this month.After the vote Thursday, Mr. Abbott characterized the tax as a \u201cuseless, destructive tax, which damaged jobs, which hurt families\u2019 cost of living and which didn\u2019t actually help the environment.\u201d He called it a \u201c9 percent impost on power prices, a $9 billion handbrake on our economy,\u201d and said the repeal would save the average household 550 dollars a year.Australia is among the world\u2019s biggest producers of carbon emissions on a per capita basis. The government is committed to reducing emissions to 5 percent below levels recorded in 2000 by 2020.Politicians from Labor and the smaller Greens party said the repeal would undermine Australia\u2019s efforts to address climate change.

Many had tried other careers first \u2014 among them were a talent scout, a ballerina, a pianist and an engineer. And some had come tantalizingly close to the prize. The dancer, Corinne Vidulich, described the agony of being on the waiting list at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx for nine months. \u201cThey let me know the week before the term started that I didn\u2019t get in,\u201d said Ms. Vidulich, wearing the telltale all-black of a New Yorker. \u201cIt was crushing.\u201dNow they were all students at St. George\u2019s University School of Medicine, one of dozens of medical schools that have sprung up in the Caribbean over the last four decades to catch the overflow of Americans who cannot find a medical school in their home country willing to take them, who for years have contended with the stigma of not being good enough.Stephen Franco\u2019s lax study habits had earned him C\u2019s in freshman biology and chemistry at Binghamton University, not good enough for the medical schools he applied to in the United States. St. George\u2019s offered him conditional admission, a four-month preview of courses, money back guaranteed if he didn\u2019t pass. He passed. But in his first semester, he regularly woke his mother late at night to tell her he was terrified and might have to drop out. \u201cIf you want to be a science teacher, that\u2019s O.K., too,\u201d she would say to console him. Now 24 and entering his third year as an honors student, he is hoping to take over his father\u2019s internal medicine practice in Brooklyn.Ms. Vidulich is more than 10 years older than Mr. Franco. Her dancer\u2019s frame is growing soft around the edges \u2014 she hasn\u2019t performed for a decade \u2014 but she speaks as if projecting to the back row. As a teenager, she studied on scholarship at the Joffrey Ballet School, but a foot injury sidelined her to dancing \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d with provincial companies. Realizing she would never fulfill her dream to join American Ballet Theater, she stopped at age 25.But she had another interest. An uncle dying of AIDS spent his last days living with her family, \u201cso I had a very early obsession with viruses.\u201d She enrolled at Hunter College, majored in biology and tied with two other students as valedictorian of the class of 2009, with a 3.98 grade-point average. \u201cI thought I was a rock star,\u201d she said. She applied to about 25 medical schools, and \u201cbasically I was wait-listed everywhere.\u201d She blames her age, 33 at the time, and her abysmal score on the verbal section of the entrance exam. \u201cThe interviewer at Einstein asked me, \u2018Are you a native English speaker?\u2019 because my score was so low.\u201dFrom the beginning, her Hunter pre-med adviser had told students to apply to Caribbean safety schools. \u201cI refused because I was too cool,\u201d Ms. Vidulich said. \u201cIt was kind of like with American Ballet Theater. I didn\u2019t want to leave New York. I felt like I deserved the best. I was humbled.\u201dSt. George\u2019s had another asset. It has tried to ensure the success of its students by paying hospitals to take them for their third- and fourth-year clinical rotations, which lead to those all-important residencies. It has entered into a $100 million, 10-year contract with the corporation for 600 spots. Usually rotations are free, causing other medical schools to grumble that they are being squeezed out. Last academic year, St. George\u2019s placed 2,326 students in rotations in 98 American cities.Ms. Vidulich is about to return home for her rotations. She no longer scoffs at Caribbean schools.\u201cNow I am truly proud of it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted it more than anything.\u201dThousands of Caribbean graduates \u2014 roughly 7,700 from St. George\u2019s alone \u2014 are licensed to practice in the United States. They have seeded hospitals and physician practices across the country and are in a position to be mentors to the next generation of Caribbean attendees.\u201cI have sons and daughters of graduates coming down now,\u201d said Charles R. Modica, St. George\u2019s chancellor.There are more than 70 medical schools across the Caribbean, about half of them catering to Americans. A handful \u2014 including St. George\u2019s, Saba University, Ross University in Dominica and American University of the Caribbean in St. Maarten, all of which are for-profit \u2014 have qualified for federal financial aid programs by demonstrating that their standards are comparable to those in the United States. And they report that high numbers of their test-takers \u2014 95 percent or more \u2014 pass the United States Medical Licensing Exam Step 1, a basic science test.The schools say that the match rate does not tell the full story, that many of their students find residencies outside the process, by going to hospitals directly. John R. Boulet, a co-author of both studies and a researcher at the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research, said that more than 90 percent of American graduates of foreign medical schools who have passed the requisite tests find a residency position. \u201cThrough persistence they eventually get in,\u201d he said.Like St. George\u2019s, Ross and American University have leveraged residencies by paying hospitals to accept their students for clinical clerkships in their third and fourth years of medical school. Those students get to know the residency directors, who may then favor them for residency positions.At St. George\u2019s, which has the largest network of clerkships, only 43 of its 672 American students applying for a residency last year did not receive one within a year. Students from foreign medical schools, however, are less likely to receive the most prestigious residencies, and many end up in rural or poor urban hospitals, and in less lucrative primary care specialties.For those who do not obtain residencies, the economic consequences can be devastating. Caribbean students are typically saddled with higher debt than medical students in the United States, in part because tuition is generally higher.Tuition and fees at St. George\u2019s come to $246,400 for four years, compared with $190,500 at Albert Einstein, the highly selective school Ms. Vidulich had hoped to attend. Average federal loan debt in 2012 was $220,000 for St. George\u2019s students, $191,500 for Ross\u2019s and $234,600 for American University\u2019s, according to the Education Department. But their federal loan default rates \u2014 1 percent or less \u2014 are about the same as for graduates in the United States, whose debt was closer to $170,000.With no centralized databank of information, or even a single accrediting body, it\u2019s hard for consumers to judge the schools.\u201cLike anything else, you pays your money and you takes your chances,\u201d Dr. Boulet said. \u201cIt would be nice to have, like, a U.S. News & World Report on foreign medical schools. It doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dThe only schools for which statistical comparisons can be easily made are those participating in financial aid programs with the Department of Education, which posts debt burden, exam passage rates and completion rates of American students. The statistics show that about half of Ross\u2019s 2012 graduates failed to graduate on time; at American University it was almost a third, and at St. George\u2019s just under a fifth. But the federal methodology doesn\u2019t follow a cohort, or take into account those who leave a program. If it did, results would look much different. Of students who entered St. George\u2019s program in fall 2009, 10 percent dropped out, 1 percent transferred and 65 percent made it to graduation in four years. Twenty percent more took five years and an additional 4 percent took six or more years.All three of these schools have tutoring and remedial programs to help students adjust to the workload and improve their study habits.Admission criteria at Caribbean schools are also more lenient, even at the top schools. The average undergraduate G.P.A. at St. George\u2019s is 3.4, compared with 3.69 stateside. The average score on the M.C.A.T. is 26, compared with 31 for schools in the United States. St. George\u2019s accepts about one of four applicants.College advisers are wary. Julie Chanatry, president of the National Association of Advisors for the Health Professions, and director of premedical advising at Colgate University, worries about the low-tier Caribbean schools where the profit-oriented business model is to \u201creject no one,\u201d regardless of a person\u2019s chances of practicing medicine. She advises students to try an osteopathic school or to strengthen their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with a post-baccalaureate degree and extracurricular experiences. She might also suggest becoming a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant. But this is not what they want to hear.\u201cMost of the kids that don\u2019t get in are pretty darn good, too,\u201d Ms. Chanatry said, \u201cand that\u2019s why we have those schools in the Caribbean that say, \u2018Hey, these kids are still good doctors.\u2019 \u201dToday, young people stroll the grounds in shorts and backpacks, play basketball and do homework at picnic tables.The campus is so self-sufficient that it has its own water desalinization plant. And the facilities are \u201cstate of the art,\u201d or so Dr. Eric Manheimer, an emissary from New York\u2019s public hospital system, reported back to his bosses after visiting in 2007.The campus may be grand, but the opportunities to practice medicine in Grenada are, at best, old-fashioned, at worst, primitive. Near the end of their second year, students go once a week for 10 weeks to Grenada General Hospital, 200 beds housed in a small cluster of yellow buildings just below a stone fort.The hospital is as quaint as a picture postcard. The wards are segregated by sex. Inside the entrance, a sign reads \u201cFemale Medical.\u201d Metal-frame beds are separated by flowered cloth curtains. Ceiling fans spin languidly overhead, and a cool breeze wafts in from Carenage harbor below. The sheets are mismatched \u2014 some patients have brought theirs from home. Most striking, though, is the tranquillity. The ubiquitous monitors, the beeping and blinking lights of American hospitals, are not there. But there is an in-house neurosurgeon for head injuries, said Dr. Dolland Noel, an associate dean, adding with a sly smile: \u201cWe are the only trauma center. We are the Level 1, 2 and 3.\u201dUncontrolled diabetes is a typical complaint. One day last spring, a clutch of interns could be found examining a diabetic woman with an abscess on her foot. Working at Grenada General has taught them medicine at the most primal level, students say.\u201cThere may not be enough insulin bags, but it\u2019s very patient-oriented,\u201d Ervand Kristosturyan, a pianist from Washington, D.C., said. He recalled seeing a woman who had been losing weight and feeling weak. When she was found to have metastatic cancer, he realized that she was a textbook case. \u201cI thought, God, this is what cancer looks like.\u201dChelsey Burke, who rejected her family\u2019s dry cleaning business in favor of St. George\u2019s, thinks the simplicity has its benefits. \u201cThe patients, they\u2019re so patient with us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey let us examine them and ask them questions for, like, two hours.\u201dClinical skills are a big part of the curriculum. The department chairman, Dr. Winston Mitchell, is a retired surgeon from SUNY Downstate Medical Center in New York. A slim bantam of a man with white hair and walnut skin, he returned to his homeland to cultivate organic cherry, passion fruit, mango and lime trees. But after Hurricane Ivan decimated his farm in 2004, he turned to teaching.In one lesson, he taught a small group of students how to conduct a chest examination, a skill they will need to demonstrate on their licensing exam. As he watched, a student playing the doctor asked the student pretending to be the patient to whisper \u201c99,\u201d and listened to the vibration in his chest. \u201cThis is what you need to practice when you go to the middle of Timbuktu and you don\u2019t have an X-ray,\u201d Dr. Mitchell told them.The largest academic department, with 80 staff and faculty members, is anatomical sciences, headed by Dr. Marios Loukas, a Greek national who trained in Poland and taught anatomy at Harvard Medical School. Wearing Hawaiian-print scrubs, he hovered protectively over a female cadaver as students teased out the sciatic nerve. Dr. Loukas tries to keep them from becoming inured to death by holding a ceremony of prayer, poetry and music at the end of the course, to honor the people who have donated their bodies.He finds that St. George\u2019s students feel less entitled than others he has taught. \u201cWe don\u2019t see attitude,\u201d Dr. Loukas said. Some would say their mood reflects their circumstances, but he disagrees. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to change the character of someone.\u201dChancellor Modica, who founded the university with three investors, understands his students\u2019 predicament firsthand. He wanted to be a doctor but was forced to attend medical school in Spain when the home schools he applied to rejected him. He dropped out after a year, and published a slender guide to getting into foreign medical schools. It sold for $8.95, and helped pay his way through law school. When he hawked the book, the most common question was how to find a foreign medical school in an English-speaking country.Sensing an opportunity, Mr. Modica sent proposals to \u201cevery English-speaking country in the world.\u201d Grenada bit, he says, in the euphoria of having just attained its independence from Britain.St. George\u2019s, named for the capital city, opened nearly three years later, in 1977.One of his first hires was C.V. Rao, a Ph.D. who is now dean of students, through a classified ad for an anatomy teacher. They met in New York. \u201cHe offered me the job on the spot,\u201d Dr. Rao recalled. \u201cHe had a contract and an airplane ticket. He was very upfront about it. He said, \u2018If you don\u2019t like it, I have a return ticket.\u2019 He didn\u2019t paint a rosy picture of this place.\u201dWhen Dr. Rao interviews prospective students, he tries to make sure they will not have a chip on their shoulder. \u201cI ask them, \u2018How will you take it when somebody says you are one of the Caribbean medical school students?\u2019 Most of them say, \u2018I want to be as good or better than them.\u2019 That\u2019s the spirit.\u201dDr. Rao, a dapper man with a droopy mustache, keeps thumb shots of all the students tacked to a wall in his office. \u201cThese are mug shots,\u201d he said in all seriousness. If a student shows disrespect to a worker or groundskeeper or maid, the student can be identified.It\u2019s a sign of the social divide here.Pretty houses on stilts decorate the hillsides, and luxury hotels in groomed gardens flank white-sand beaches. The university dominates the island, and is deeply entwined in the local economy, vying with tourism and remittances from Grenadians working abroad as a leading source of gross domestic product.But the campus is a gated community. A short stroll outside the automatic gates finds children in raggedy clothing and, on one evening, a little girl squatting to urinate in a drainage ditch. Students have been warned not to walk alone at night because of the danger of being mugged at machete point, or worse. Shuttle buses take students to off-campus housing and to the supermarket.Immersion in island life breeds a certain cynicism.The IGA market that caters to foreigners is overpriced and sometimes runs out of milk and vegetables. \u201cTomatoes are more expensive than beer,\u201d Iana Gueorguieva, an Ohioan who just finished her first year, said disgustedly.\u201cCigarettes are cheap,\u201d said her friend, Rachel Lewis, from Colorado.\u201cRum is cheaper than cereal,\u201d Ms. Gueorguieva said.Rent near campus is high; Ms. Lewis pays $950 for a studio. But those who live farther away, in the same buildings as the locals, pay less. Mr. Franco\u2019s rent is $300 a month, including $18 a week for mandatory maid service, which apartments routinely come with because labor is so cheap.The culture shock can be hard.\u201cYou kind of have to survive,\u201d Ms. Vidulich said. \u201cYou\u2019re so far from everyone and you\u2019re dealing with a lot of island antics.\u201d For instance, the Internet goes down when demand is high, typically during finals week. \u201cOur first term, we didn\u2019t have anatomy books for a while. They were lost on a boat in St. Lucia. They gave us PDFs. It was kind of a weird adjustment.\u201dThat first year was an academic hazing. By her third term, Ms. Vidulich said, her ability to master the material had grown so much that it seemed like \u201ca joke\u201d by comparison.Many students hole up in the library and never explore the island. Some find more balance. Ms. Gueorguieva dashes around on a blue Hussar scooter, and proudly wears a scar from a fall. She parties at Bananas, a bar that lives up to its name. She is proud of having eaten iguana at a local restaurant, though once was enough. She has rented a catamaran and hiked to the Seven Sisters falls. She is active in the Women in Medicine club, performing community service like helping pregnant girls continue their education.They are here, the students say, because American medical schools do not see beyond G.P.A.s and test scores to underlying attributes like intellectual curiosity. To get into one, they say, it is better to go to an easy college and not risk mistakes.Ms. Lewis, poised, athletic and casual in a \u201cLove\u201d pendant and flip-flops, graduated from Amherst College as a political science major. Sipping Stag beer one evening with two friends at Options, an outdoor food court near campus, she said that she originally resisted going into medicine, like her father, and wanted to be a lawyer, like her mother. But she changed her mind after working as a paralegal after college.To meet the science requirements, she took a premedical post-baccalaureate program at New York University, where she was a B student, and then at the University of Colorado, Denver, where she got straight A\u2019s. She applied to more than a dozen medical schools. None of the admissions officers seemed to care very much that she had gone to a highly selective college, she said, or had been captain of the lacrosse team or had worked at a clinic for homeless families.She was invited for only two interviews, at George Washington University and St. George\u2019s, which she applied to after noticing an ad on the New York City subway. St. George\u2019s was her only acceptance.\u201cIf you get B\u2019s in half your coursework, like me, that\u2019s an easy way for them to cut out all those people,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough spots.\u201d Now 29, she has finished her first semester and is \u201cincredibly grateful\u201d for the chance to become a doctor. \u201cYou have to have a burning, unending desire, to put yourself through something like this,\u201d she said.Ms. Lewis would like to be an eye surgeon like her father, but her ambition is tempered by the reality that the most competitive specialties are often closed to Caribbean graduates. Still, she believes that once she has clawed her way through and is a full-fledged doctor, no one will care where she went to medical school. It will have been just one step along the road. She will hang her diploma next to her residency, perhaps a fellowship and board certification. But, she says, she will not hide it.Anemona Hartocollis is a metropolitan reporter for The Times covering health care.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Says Former Security Chief Is Being Investigated for Corruption", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 President Xi Jinping\u2019s campaign against corruption among the Chinese elite took public aim on Tuesday at its biggest target so far, when the Communist Party announced an investigation of Zhou Yongkang, the former chief of domestic security.The news was reported almost immediately on Chinese state news media and delivered by a grim-faced anchor on the main evening news broadcast. The reports gave no details about the allegations, but they pointedly omitted the word \u201ccomrade\u201d in referring to Mr. Zhou, a sign that an official has been severed from the party and faces punishment.Mr. Zhou is the first member, sitting or retired, of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party\u2019s inner ring of power, to face an inquest by the commission for corruption and abuses of power.In an online commentary Tuesday evening, People\u2019s Daily, the party\u2019s main newspaper, portrayed Mr. Zhou\u2019s downfall as an object lesson.\u201cZhou Yongkang was a big tiger, and if even he can be brought down, any corrupt elements nursing delusions will understand: If they stretch out their hands, they will get caught,\u201d the commentary said.Deng Yuwen, formerly an editor at The Study Times, a weekly newspaper issued by the Central Party School in Beijing, described Mr. Xi\u2019s decision to take down Mr. Zhou as a bid to cement his authority.Although the official announcement about Mr. Zhou did not mention criminal charges, the opening of a party investigation greatly increases the chances that Mr. Zhou will be indicted, tried and sentenced to prison, according to Mr. Deng, who is now a freelance commentator on Chinese politics.Several members of Zhou Yongkang\u2019s family have made investments in companies with ties to the China National Petroleum Corp., the state oil company formerly run by Mr. Zhou.That estimate was based on publicly available records and a limited assessment of their companies\u2019 value; it did not include real estate or overseas assets, which are more difficult to identify and value.The investigation could send tremors through the Chinese political landscape because of Mr. Zhou\u2019s seniority, and because Mr. Xi and his colleagues have now broken an unspoken compact among China\u2019s elite that leaders who ascended to the summit of power \u2014 the Politburo Standing Committee \u2014 would be immune from formal investigations, even in retirement.Mr. Zhou, 71, retired at the same party congress that elevated Mr. Xi, but he remained a potentially dangerous adversary, with ties to other senior retired figures and to officials who rose under him. Still, earlier graft investigations have shaken his bases of influence \u2014 in Sichuan Province in China\u2019s southwest; in the nation\u2019s biggest oil and gas conglomerate, the China National Petroleum Corporation; and in the country\u2019s police and civilian intelligence services.At the zenith of his power, few Chinese politicians were more intimidating than Mr. Zhou. For the five years that he sat on the Standing Committee, he was also in charge of the party committee overseeing the police, the domestic security forces and the civilian intelligence service, as well as courts, prosecutors and prisons. He proved willing to apply police power with little regard for China\u2019s already weak legal fetters.The party leadership had decided late last year to pursue Mr. Zhou, but there was no public confirmation until now, people close to senior officials have said. The news coincided with an announcement that the party\u2019s Central Committee would meet in October and that \u201cpromoting governing the country according to law and other major issues\u201d would be on the agenda.People close to senior officials have said that Mr. Zhou\u2019s son, Zhou Bin, is central to the party investigation and has also been detained, as have other members of Mr. Zhou\u2019s extended family, including his wife, Jia Xiaoye; a brother, Zhou Yuanqing; and a sister-in-law, Zhou Lingying.One political consultant in Beijing who meets with senior and mid-ranking officials said he had been told that Zhou Bin recently gave new direct evidence against his father, who, according to the consultant and other party insiders, had strongly denied any personal wrongdoing during months of detention. The new evidence helped solidify a consensus among top leaders to announce the investigation publicly, said the consultant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing his access to officials.\u201cIn fact, the party wanted to make it public earlier, but they couldn\u2019t,\u201d the consultant said. \u201cSo now they\u2019re finally able to make it public, and can breathe a sigh of relief.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of traceable assets held by Zhou Yongkang\u2019s son, his sister-in-law and his son\u2019s mother-in-law, according to an investigation by The New York Times. It is a billion renminbi, about $160 million, not $1 billion.Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Leaning on Thailand\u2019s Junta", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorKYOTO, Japan \u2014 Over the past two months, Thailand has been wrenched backward into a dark age. In May, partisan judges forced Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra out of office, and then royalist generals seized power from the caretaker government. It was the 13th military coup since the end of the absolute monarchy eight decades ago.Once again the generals were claiming to step into a political mess simply to restore order. But this time the stakes are especially high, particularly for the traditional elite \u2014 the military, conservative royalists, many judges and senior bureaucrats and big businesses. King Bhumibol Adulyadej is 86 years old, and the crown prince is not as popular. The military, wary of any uncertainties in the approaching succession battle, which it sees as a zero-sum game, is trying to silence critics of the old-time elite, including members of the Red Shirt movement backed by Thaksin Shinawatra, Ms. Yingluck\u2019s brother and a former prime minister himself.It seemed at first that the Shinawatras\u2019 supporters would be the best counterforce against the military. But the coup makers promptly went after the Red Shirts\u2019 networks in far-flung provinces, arresting some local leaders. As a result, official condemnation of the coup by the international community has been more important than it might otherwise have been, and still more pressure on the generals could prove surprisingly effective.Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha \u2014 the army chief, coup leader and now self-appointed interim prime minister \u2014 has made vague promises about an eventual return to democracy. Meanwhile, the junta has been trying to bolster its popularity with crude populism and by promoting a program under the banner \u201cReturning Happiness to Thais.\u201d It has showered the population with expensive short-term treats, like free broadcasts of the World Cup on national TV and free tickets to patriotic movies.Despite the official facade of national unity, the junta has tried to suppress even the mildest expressions of dissent, harassing and detaining critics, and in some cases charging them under an archaic l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law that forbids criticism of the royal family. (On May 24, I was summoned to appear before the army for speaking out against the coup. I live in Kyoto and refused to go, and on June 13 an arrest warrant was issued against me.)And vulnerable it is. The Thai military\u2019s last coup in 2006 proved a failure because Mr. Thaksin\u2019s political influence endured even after he was deposed, and the next election brought another pro-Thaksin party to power. The generals are busy cracking down on Thaksin supporters because they are wary of repeating the same mistake, even though that undermines the claim that their latest putsch was a coup for democracy.The junta seems to think its survival depends on its popular appeal. That in turn may depend on the junta\u2019s ability to deliver economic benefits \u2014 which in turn may depend on how much Western countries are willing to tolerate the suspension of democratic freedoms.Thailand is particularly vulnerable to sanctions because the country is an essential link in the global supply chains of crucial commodities like rice and automobiles. Buyers are also dependent on these supply chains, but they can more readily turn to, say, Vietnam and Myanmar to buy rice than Thailand can diversify the goods it produces. This is one reason the junta is making overtures to Beijing: Just two weeks after the coup, General Prayuth was shaking hands with Chinese business leaders, with an eye to offsetting the effects of sanctions from the West.These are silly reactions, of course, but like the generals\u2019 turn to Beijing, they reveal a deep anxiety about the damage that pressure from the West may do to the Thai economy and the junta\u2019s popularity. Sanctions are often derided as symbolic and ineffectual, but they are proving useful against the coup leaders in Bangkok.The West should broaden its reach. Increasing the economic costs of the junta\u2019s illegitimate hold on power would loosen the generals\u2019 grip, and help the Red Shirts and other anti-junta activists restore democracy in Thailand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Major Indexes Fall on Concern Over Ukraine and Gaza", "Date": "2014-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market slipped on Monday as investors remained cautious about instability in Ukraine and Gaza, though the three major indexes ended well above their lows, a sign that some appetite for riskier assets remained.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell as much as 0.6 percent, though it recovered most of those losses and closed right above its 14-day moving average, suggesting buyers were using weakness to return to the market. Still, losses were broad, and nine of the 10 primary S.&P. 500 sector indexes fell, with only the S.&P. energy sector index rising modestly.Violence escalated in the Gaza Strip despite growing international calls for a cease-fire. The Palestinian death toll exceeded 500, while Israel\u2019s losses also mounted. While the impact on the American economy is seen as minimal, investors are concerned about the fallout from a long period of increased violence and the prospect that it could spread to other parts of the Middle East.Investors also kept watch on the uncertain situation in Ukraine, where fighting flared in Donetsk, an eastern city. Last week a Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down over Ukraine, adding to an already tense situation between the country and Russia.\u201cWe\u2019re certainly paying attention to the issues abroad, but right now, they don\u2019t seem like the kind of events that will have anything beyond a short-term impact,\u201d said John Chisholm, chief investment officer at Acadian Asset Management. \u201cWe expect these uncertainties to be reversed in two or three weeks.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.45 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 17,051.73. The S.&P. 500 declined 4.59 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,973.63. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 7.44 points, or 0.17 percent, to 4,424.70. Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index, climbed 6.2 percent to 12.81, a level that is well below its historical average of 20. Some analysts have suggested that the low volatility has left the market \u2014 which has not had a correction, defined as a 10 percent pullback, since October 2011 \u2014 vulnerable to a shock.\u201cMarkets aren\u2019t particularly attractive, and it seems likely that we\u2019ll see a correction of 10 to 15 percent, though the timing on that is very difficult to say,\u201d Mr. Chisholm said.In after-hours trading, Netflix rose $5.10, or 1.1 percent, to $457.05 after it reported a quarterly profit that more than doubled from a year earlier. Chipotle Mexican Grill jumped $57.56, or 9.8 percent, to $647.49 in after-hours training after it reported second-quarter revenue that sharply exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations.Texas Instruments also reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations after the market closed, but its shares slipped 36 cent, or 0.7 percent, to $48.81 in after-hours trading.During the regular trading session, Herbalife plunged $6.82, or 11.2 percent, to $54.02 after the activist hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, who is short the stock and runs Pershing Square Capital Management, told CNBC that he would present evidence on Tuesday that the company was an \u201cincredible fraud.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s slid $1.44, or 1.5 percent, to $97.55 and Yum Brands fell $3.29, or 4.2 percent, to $74.13 as the fast-food restaurant chains face a new food safety scare in China, hurting efforts to shore up reputations damaged by a 2012 safety scandal in one of their biggest markets.In the bond market, interest rates were slightly lower. The yield on the Treasury\u2019s 10-year note dipped to 2.47 percent, from 2.48 percent late Friday, while its price rose 4/32, to 100 9/32.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Carbon Tax\u2019s Ignoble End", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 It will be remembered as one of the most ignoble moments in our history: On July 17, Australia became the first country to repeal a carbon tax.The tax, or carbon-pricing mechanism, had defined three elections, destabilized three prime ministers and dominated public debate in this country for eight toxic years. Finally, the leader of the center-right Liberal Party, Tony Abbott, won the last election in part by promising to \u201cax the tax.\u201dMr. Abbott is famous for his fitness and muscular approach. As a student at Oxford, he won a \u201cblue\u201d at boxing for the university and was known for his all-out, flailing attacks. When the carbon-pricing scheme became law in 2011, he vowed to lead a \u201cpeople\u2019s revolt\u201d and \u201cfight this tax every second of every minute of every day.\u201dHis political success was not, in fact, a result of the failure of the policy. The scheme was, in at least the most important sense, working, since emissions were declining. The initial public opposition was fading, but the Labor government that introduced the policy failed to sell it. Critics portrayed it as a burden that would hurt businesses and cost households, instead of one that would cut pollution and ensure a more secure future for our children.It was the misleading old clich\u00e9 \u2014 the economy versus the environment \u2014 but politicians staked their careers on it, and won.In 2010, the Labor prime minister, Julia Gillard, said she would look at carbon-pricing proposals, but also promised, \u201cThere will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.\u201d Then, under pressure to form a minority government, she made a deal with the Greens and agreed to legislate a carbon price: a tax by any other name.The heat, anger and vitriol directed at her as a leader \u2014 and as Australia\u2019s first woman to be prime minister \u2014 coalesced around the promise and the tax. It grew strangely nasty: She was branded by a right-wing shockjock as \u201cJu-Liar,\u201d a moniker she struggled to shake. The political cynicism surrounding the carbon tax certainly reduced Ms. Gillard\u2019s political capital, but it was a perceived lack of conviction in the policy itself that damaged the pricing scheme\u2019s credibility.Business leaders opposed what Mr. Abbott called a \u201cuseless, destructive tax,\u201d even though just 0.02 percent of Australia\u2019s three million businesses were affected (the top 500 polluters). But Australia is one of the world\u2019s biggest producers of coal, and the industry is worth about $60 billion and supports an estimated 200,000 jobs.A powerful triumvirate campaigned against the law: mining companies, the conservative coalition parties and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s newspapers. A study found that 82 percent of articles on the carbon tax in News Corporation\u2019s Australian papers were negative.Ms. Gillard now believes she made a crucial error in framing. After losing office in June 2013, she wrote: \u201cI erred by not contesting the label \u2018tax\u2019 for the fixed price period of the emissions trading scheme I introduced. I feared the media would end up playing constant silly word games with me, trying to get me to say the word \u2018tax.\u201d\u2019George Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, agreed that \u201cwas a disaster.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just the T-word; even the term \u201ccarbon price\u201d was a problem, too abstract and technical: \u201cIt does not evoke in the minds of the public the real human horrors and economic costs of climate disasters.\u201d\u201cI made the wrong choice,\u201d Ms. Gillard conceded, \u201cand, politically, it hurt me terribly.\u201d With Labor plummeting in the polls, her leadership was challenged and she lost the vote to the party\u2019s previous leader, Kevin Rudd. (Mr. Rudd\u2019s victory was shortlived; less than three months later, he was defeated general election by Mr. Abbott.)Opposition to the carbon tax trailed away after Ms. Gillard\u2019s ouster, and public concern about climate change has only grown. A recent poll found that almost two-thirds of Australians believe there should be carbon pricing for major emitters, but 42 percent agreed with the repeal of the tax (against 36 percent who did not). We did, after all, elect a government that promised to ax it. So we\u2019re a hot mess of contradictions.If carbon pricing was working, you might well ask why the law was repealed. The result is that Australia has no clear climate policy, though Mr. Abbott says he now believes climate change is occurring and he takes it \u201cvery seriously.\u201dThe prime minister\u2019s paramount concern, though, is still that taxing emissions should not \u201cclobber the economy.\u201d His government has proposed an alternative to the carbon tax, the Direct Action Scheme, that would provide incentives for businesses to cut emissions. But it faces fierce criticism \u2014 even from within Mr. Abbott\u2019s own administration \u2014 because of loopholes, a lack of consequences for nonparticipants and its unfunded targets.What\u2019s clear is that Australia has proved again that politicians rarely choose to take the lead on tackling climate change. When the public is conflicted, our leaders too often whip up fear, and reason and evidence go out the window. The shame is that when the tax was axed, so were the facts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fauna, Flora and Freighters in the Danube Delta", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExplorerI once heard an unusual tale about an Indian investment broker working in Bucharest, Romania, who had become enchanted by the Danube River Delta region, with its lonely canals, floating reed beds and silver onion-domed monasteries alongside quaint blue cottages in fishing villages one could only reach by boat. The resort, which has since changed hands, was opened against the backdrop of an Eastern Europe that was making significant economic strides. And the story of it lingered with me, for many reasons. Like Mr. Singh, I have a fondness for Eastern Europe. My father was born in Budapest, and I was an exchange student there in 1991. I toured western Romania at the end of my year abroad. Two years later, I served with the Peace Corps in Poland. Back then, Romania was still redefining itself after the overthrow and assassination of the Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. It seemed a hopeful gesture to open an eco-resort in a historically neglected region, to employ locals in order to create a robust economic engine. Last summer, I returned to Romania to see what had become of the country, and that dream. The great Danube River, the Continent\u2019s longest after the Volga, originates deep in the Black Forest in Germany and meanders southeastward through 10 countries and four capitals before finally emptying into the Black Sea. There, touching the borders of Romania and Ukraine, it disintegrates into a wild labyrinth of channels, swamps, lakes and countless corridors of reeds. I got to the delta region via road. Upon arriving in Bucharest, a resort bus and driver were waiting for me. It would be a three-and-a-half-hour drive. We passed prairies and groves of dried sunflowers, miles of apple orchards and, along the roadsides, makeshift wooden tables with bushels of gladiolas and mountains of red and green grapes for the honest taking. We sometimes shared the road with horse-drawn carriages sinking beneath loads of humongous watermelons or bright yellow corn and had to occasionally make way for gaggles of geese or shepherds and their flocks crossing the road. I saw, too, abandoned factories immersed in weeds and bleak prefabricated tenement housing with laundry fluttering from balconies, legacies of Communist urban planning. It seemed as if little had changed since my last visit to the country, almost a quarter century ago.The Delta Nature Resort, with its 30 bungalows, overlooks the western edge of the delta, just outside the town of Tulcea. While I checked in, I went over my two-day itinerary with the resort\u2019s tourism director, who told me she had arranged for a speedboat to take me along one of the three main delta canals. When we looked at the map, however, and she showed me which canal, I told her I was intrigued by another one because I\u2019d read the area around it had served as hunting grounds for Ceaucescu. The director laughed and, sweeping her hand across the delta map, said, \u201cBut this was all his!\u201d I ended up taking the tour she suggested. My bungalow was comfortable and spacious, with whitewashed walls, a sitting room and colorful rugs across the wooden floor. After unpacking, I sat on the veranda for a privileged view of the sun setting across the desolate steppes. It was silent, until I heard \u2014 and then turned to see \u2014 hundreds of egrets among the reed beds erupt into flight toward the setting sun, and then suddenly swerve en masse toward the Black Sea, a spectacular image, as if in a dream. The moment of stillness was but a memory the next day, when I headed out from Tulcea\u2019s harbor on a speedboat with Vasile, a burly, stoic man who chain-smoked and spoke no English but, I was told, was a delta native who\u2019d fished the area since he was a boy. We zipped by deserted, rusty barges and houseboats until Vasile took us north into quieter canals and slowed down to point out to me whenever he saw an egret or stork or falcon, sometimes a cormorant, in the distance, standing motionless. We cruised by fishermen and women in track suits with their poles amid weeping willows and black poplars, and by grazing cows and goats.At one point, Vasile abruptly slowed the motor and jerked the boat around. He\u2019d seen something. \u201cProblem?\u201d I asked, but he only put his finger to his lips as he veered into a narrow, heavily wooded channel. I was alone with this stranger, and my imagination started to get the best of me until we reached the mouth of what I saw on my map was Lake Furtuna, one of the delta\u2019s largest. And as we entered, I was greeted by a stunning vista: a vast carpet of pelicans covering almost every inch of water, clucking and paddling and flapping their wings among clusters of white and yellow waterlilies. I ambled to the bow, marveling at the scene and snapping photos, so engrossed that I barely noticed Vasile had turned off the motor. When I looked back at him, I saw his boyish half-smile, and that he was every bit as transfixed as I was.At Sulina, the delta\u2019s biggest town, Vasile motioned that he would nap while I went ashore to have lunch on the esplanade. My meal was fatty swordfish and French fries, but also a tasty house white wine, accompanied by stray dogs circling my table. When I returned to the boat, Vasile was still asleep, so I continued along the esplanade, looking up at iron-lattice balconies hanging at rakish angles and buildings in various stages of arrested decline, all covered in chipped paint. I saw snoozing mutts in front of boarded-up houses, and I tried to imagine the prosperous port Sulina had once been in the early 1900s, when it was the seat of the European Danube Commission. As we sped back toward Tulcea, in almost every direction I looked, electrical power cables stretched toward the horizon. There were hollowed-out warehouses and crumbling smokestacks, and giant freighters plying the canals. In Tulcea, a Soviet-era factory still used for manufacturing aluminum juts out to the shore. On my map, I saw how the waters had been dammed and rerouted over the centuries to make it easier to navigate. Never before had I seen the industrial so close to the pastoral, and moreover, where the pastoral is supposed to be protected. While the resort offered a way into this idyll, staying there was a reminder that it was not the well-oiled machine you\u2019d find in a busier tourist destination. Among the things that went wrong: My meal orders in the restaurant got consistently mixed up, a television there blared nonstop, the pool was dirty, the Jacuzzi was out of order, the safe in my room was broken. The staff, though well intentioned, was young and inexperienced, as command of English was seemingly the sole requirement for employment. The frustration slid off me the next day, when I took an excursion on a small fishing boat across the brackish Lake Samova toward the 19th-century Saon Monastery. My guide was Ross, a 20-something who spoke English and was working as a chef and tour guide at the resort. Homesick for the delta, where he was born, he\u2019d recently moved back from a six-year stay in Italy. His passion for the delta was evident throughout his tour, when he pointed out a true silver pheasant at the monastery aviary, and the glowing icons and exquisite paintings inside the church, as well as a wooden pagoda sheltering five copper bells. Later on the boat, he plucked marsh thistles, and happily described how he spices his cooking with them. If everyone who spent time in the region was entranced, why was it still a sleepy backwater, I wondered. I talked about this one morning with a French couple at the resort, and they referred me to an independent tour guide in Tulcea. I caught up with Iuliana Stanescu via email a few days later, told her my impressions of the delta and asked her for hers.\u201cI like my job, and most of all I love this beautiful spot called the Danube Delta,\u201d she wrote me. \u201cThe authorities don\u2019t apply the law as they should in order to keep this spot clean, they don\u2019t implement a development program.\u201dEdward Bratfanof, governor of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority, acknowledged that it could be better preserved. While there are no \u201cindustrial activities\u201d inside the reserve, he said, fishing, reed harvesting, cattle breeding, small-scale agriculture, tourism and \u201cservices for people\u2019s day-to-day life\u201d are allowed. He acknowledged, however, that the speed at which freighters travel there remains a problem. A new law is under consideration \u201cin view to protect the fauna and flora and to reduce bank erosion.\u201d It was a delicate balance, he added, to encourage tourism and revenue for the region and yet \u201cdecrease the pressure on natural resources, especially on fish populations.\u201dI left the delta dazed by its utopian landscape but, like Iuliana, concerned for its vulnerable beauty. This was nearly a year ago, and I thought recently to track down Diwaker Singh, curious as to what had happened to him and how it was that the delta region had so beguiled him. Now living in London, Mr. Singh quickly responded to my email, telling me he still visits the delta at least once a year. \u201cRomania is resplendent with natural assets which can be exploited for sustainable tourism,\u201d he wrote me, describing how he and his wife were personally invested in the resort, ensuring its quality for guests. \u201cHowever, the country has found little interest with tour operators because of lack of adequate, targeted and sustained marketing.\u201dHe told me of Ceausescu\u2019s industrialization of the delta region, how the deposed dictator had converted it to farmland with a focus on exports, in light of proximity to the Black Sea. \u201cThe current generation of Romanians love their nature and are keen to preserve it,\u201d Mr. Singh wrote. \u201cI strongly believe that in time, as the economy of the country improves, the delta will come back to its full glory.\u201dHOW EXTREME?Rankings are from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very).Remoteness: 3The delta is a three-hour drive from Bucharest, and the Delta Nature Resort offers shuttle service. It\u2019s mostly freeway from Bucharest to the delta region, but the last few dozen miles are country roads. The resort is several miles from the nearest town, Tulcea.Creature Discomforts: 3Rooms at the Delta Nature Resort are spacious and nicely furnished, but there\u2019s room for improvement with the service. All rooms have nice porch views of the delta.Physical Difficulty: 2You should feel comfortable being on the water because you see the delta on speedboats. Tours usually last several hours.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Far From Home, an Arab Summer", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt Review\u201cQalandia 2087,\u201d by the Palestinian artist Wafa Hourani, part of a new exhibition,\u00a0titled \u201cHere and Elsewhere,\u201d at the New Museum featuring contemporary art from and about the Arab world. More images from the show, which runs through Sept. 28, are on the following slides.Most of our New York museums give us gussied-up versions of what we already know. The New Museum was created almost 35 years ago to do the opposite, to give us art we barely knew existed. With \u201cHere and Elsewhere,\u201d it thrillingly fulfills that mandate.Hidden behind that noncommittal title is a potentially volatile subject: what the museum advertises as contemporary art \u201cfrom and about the Arab world.\u201d I winced at the description. After decades of postcolonial consciousness raising, we\u2019ve grown leery of shows that lump sundry unalike cultures together, as this one does with artists from Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates, not to mention Europe and the United States.Is it possible, under such circumstances, to avoid stereotypes? Where, within an all-purpose \u201cArab\u201d theme, should emphasis fall? Should a show play up newsy politics or thwart expectations and play them down? Emphasize individual sensibilities or define overarching trends? To what degree should the market dictate the choice of participants? (A few artists in \u201cHere and Elsewhere\u201d \u2014 Kader Attia, Yto Barrada, Susan Hefuna, Wael Shawky \u2014 have shown in New York, though most are making local debuts. Several others declined the invitation to appear in an \u201cArab\u201d context.)In reality, there\u2019s no right way to go. But if shows like this are the only way, given the provincial nature of the New York art world, that we get to learn about what\u2019s happening across the globe, so be it. And let it be the New Museum doing the job.It had already shaped a cogent model in its 2011 \u201cOstalgia,\u201d a survey of art from Eastern Europe. \u201cHere and Elsewhere\u201d is in that league, thanks to having the same curator, Massimiliano Gioni, who was named artistic director of the museum on Thursday, and an in-house team: Natalie Bell, Gary Carrion-Murayari, Helga Christoffersen and Margot Norton. It\u2019s a big show, intricately pieced together on all five floors of the museum, and starts on the street-level facade with a large-scale photograph of an ultra-plush Abu Dhabi hotel. The image was installed by the cosmopolitan collective called GCC, made up of eight artists scattered from Dubai to London and New York who make it their business to focus on the preposterous wealth concentrated in a few hands in a few oil-rich countries on the Persian Gulf. (Portraits of the collective\u2019s members dressed as sheikhs are visible above the ticket desk.)The works in the lobby galleries introduce themes that will echo on floors above. Surely, pilgrimage is the correct word for the arduous and illegal treks to Europe by the African and South Asian immigrants who appear in videos by Bouchra Khalili on the fourth floor. We never see their faces, only their hands tracing on a map the impossibly tangled routes they took in search of jobs, freedom and families.And in various pieces throughout the show, public architecture and politics are inseparable.In 2008, the Syrian artist Hrair Sarkissian shot empty plazas in Damascus where, until the revolt against Bashar al-Assad began, criminals were hanged. Photographs by Ziad Antar and Fouad Elkoury depict a war-strafed Beirut as a city of ruins, while Marwan Rechmaoui replicates, in sculptural miniature, the high-rise he once lived in there. In a fantastically detailed architectural model, Wafa Hourani gives the overcrowded Palestinian refugee camp Qalandia a utopian spin, imagining it in the future as a place of order and peace, with lamp-lit homes and sweet music wafting through the night. That future, of course, is a fantasy. Today, Qalandia is at a contested checkpoint between Jerusalem and Ramallah where violent clashes flare.Suha Traboulsi\u2019s cool minimalist-before-Minimalism abstract paintings from the 1940s predate her turbulent career as a performance artist. The Moroccan artist Mohamed Larbi Rahali attended art school in Morocco in the late 1960s but dropped out, preferring to work as a boat mechanic and fisherman. In 1984, after doing some doodles on the interior of a discarded matchbox, he decided that art might be for him after all. In the past 30 years, he\u2019s produced thousands of matchbook pictures and assemblages, which he refers to collectively as \u201cOmri\u201d (\u201cMy Life\u201d).The exhibition\u2019s title, \u201cHere and Elsewhere,\u201d is lifted from a 1976 film, by Jean-Luc Godard and collaborators, which was initiated as a pro-Palestinian political tract but ended up questioning the truth-telling role of images and acknowledging the role of fiction in shaping history. Artists have always understood this dynamic. Fakhri El Ghezal, born in Tunisia in 1981, photographs generations-old family mementos to create a wry and probing \u201cwho am I?\u201d self-portrait. And a professional photographic portraitist Hashem El Madani, who opened his studio in Lebanon in 1947, chronicled the illusions of an entire era: In his day, conservative morals prohibited men and women from kissing on camera, but same-sex smooches were allowed, and that\u2019s what we see in his poignant double portraits.The history of that someplace \u2014 even of any small part of it \u2014 is immensely complicated and its art still little seen here. (This may change. The Metropolitan Museum recently posted a notice that it was seeking a curator specializing in 20th- and 21st-century art of the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey.) To appreciate this show fully, a little homework can\u2019t hurt. But really all you need to do is be willing to linger, read labels and let not-knowing be a form of bliss. In return, you\u2019ll get wonderful artists, deep ideas, fabulous stories and the chance, still too seldom offered by our museums, to be a global citizen. Don\u2019t pass it up.\u00a0\u00a0An art review on July 18 about \u201cHere and Elsewhere\u201d at the New Museum in Manhattan, an exhibition of contemporary art from and about the Arab world, misidentified the youngest participant in the show. He is Abdullah al-Mutairi, a member of the GCC collective, not Fakhri El Ghezal. The review, using information from the exhibition catalog, erroneously included one artist among the founders of the Arab Image Foundation and omitted another. Besides Akram Zaatari and Fouad Elkoury, Samer Mohdad founded the group. While Walid Raad was a member, he was not a founder.\u201cHere and Elsewhere\u201d runs through Sept. 28 at the New Museum, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side; 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Parent Answering a Call for Pre-K Teachers Goes Back to Work (and School)", "Date": "2014-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Working LifeLong before her campers tumble out of bed for breakfast, Lisa Martino is huddled over her kitchen table, poring over her graduate school textbooks and clack-clack-clacking on her laptop as she absorbs lessons on literacy and curriculum development.By the time the children arrive at camp around 8 a.m., she has been up for three or four hours. And her day is just getting started.This summer, Ms. Martino is guiding a phalanx of 4-year-olds as they dash through sprinklers and navigate the complex social universe that is summer camp in Glendale, Queens. To the children and parents, she is simply Miss Lisa, a group leader who tames the unruly buckles of wayward water shoes and tells engrossing stories about sharks and giants.But she is not just a camp counselor. She is a 48-year-old career changer, soon to be in the vanguard of New York City\u2019s sweeping expansion of early childhood education.In the fall, Ms. Martino will join the army of new teachers \u2014 as many as 1,000 in all \u2014 who will lead classrooms across the city as Mayor Bill de Blasio rolls out the first phase of his universal prekindergarten program.Will she be ready?Some days, she\u2019s certain. Some days, she\u2019s not.\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d Ms. Martino said, taking a rare break. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so excited about work in my life. But I\u2019m still learning the lay of the land.\u201dThis will be Ms. Martino\u2019s first preschool classroom and her first full-time job after a decade as a stay-at-home mother. (Her children are now 6 and 9 years old.). She is working on her second graduate degree, having earned a master\u2019s degree to become a guidance counselor in her 20s.The program \u2014 which offers a fully funded master\u2019s degree in early childhood education from the City University of New York, along with a full-time prekindergarten teaching position \u2014 was aimed at people who were new to teaching but had a bachelor\u2019s degree in liberal arts, a 3.0 grade-point average and a passion for working with young children.One can imagine the kind of interest the promise of free graduate studies and a full-time job with benefits generated in this unsettled economy. About 1,200 people applied for the roughly 100 slots.Many of those chosen were career changers like Ms. Martino, who had worked as a director of student activities at a local college and then in accounting and legal compliance for a corporate political action committee before deciding to stay home to raise her children.Over the years, she began to think that working with young children might be her calling. She volunteered for the PTA and for her local Girl Scout troop. After she and her husband split, her search took on greater urgency. In January, she started working as a substitute teacher. But without state certification in teaching, she couldn\u2019t find a full-time job.When she found out in May that she had been selected for the fellowship, she felt as if she had won the jackpot.Ms. Martino\u2019s job at Little Stars will pay $44,000 a year.She still weeps sometimes when she talks about it.\u201cSome people never get to do what they dream about,\u201d said Ms. Martino, who will receive state certification once she completes the fellowship program.This summer, she helps to lead the camp classroom, singing days-of-the-week songs, teaching new vocabulary and leading discussions about kindness and respect.Then, four nights a week, she typically heads to Queens College for her graduate courses, where she and her fellow teachers-in-training are currently working on developing curriculums for the coming year.The workload won\u2019t ease up after school starts. Ms. Martino and her colleagues will work toward earning nine to 12 credits per semester, in addition to holding their full-time jobs, to ensure that they can get their degrees and certification next summer. A program liaison will help them juggle their multiple responsibilities, offering advice and support in their classrooms.\u201cI\u2019m a little nervous that it might be a little overwhelming,\u201d said Janine Mahon, the director of program operations for the Greater Ridgewood Youth Council, who hired Ms. Martino.Several people have dropped out of the program. But Ms. Martino said she is determined to see it through. She owes it to herself, she said, and to the children who will be counting on her in September.Email: swarns@nytimes.com\nTwitter: @rachelswarnsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "About Those Presidential Polls", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerhaps you\u2019ve heard that Barack Obama was named the worst president since World War II in a recent poll. It isn\u2019t all that surprising. Given the current mood of the country, it\u2019s likely that if St. Francis of Assisi were in the White House, he would be getting terrible ratings, too. Opinions about presidents change. I am pointing this out mainly because it gives me an opening to bring up Warren Harding.July is going to be Warren Harding\u2019s month. It\u2019s really exciting, given the fact that Harding hasn\u2019t had a month, or even a day, since around 1928. \u201cWarren Harding is best known as America\u2019s worst president,\u201d wrote John Dean at the beginning of his Harding biography.Yes! This is the same John Dean who was White House counsel in the Nixon administration. He knows about terrible presidents, and he is totally on Harding\u2019s side.Later this month the Library of Congress is going to open up a huge cache of love letters that Harding wrote to one of his neighbors in Marion, Ohio. The Times Magazine will be publishing some of the most interesting missives next week. They were sent to Carrie Phillips, who was his wife\u2019s best friend and might conceivably have been a German spy.If that\u2019s not enough of a draw, I will feel forced to reveal that Harding refers to his most private part as \u201cJerry.\u201d\u201cHe was a very funny guy. Just a nice sense of humor,\u201d said James Robenalt, who discovered copies of the letters and wrote about them in \u201cThe Harding Affair.\u201d Robenalt, like Dean, thinks Harding is a vastly underestimated president. Not everyone agrees that he\u2019s due for a renaissance. \u201cIf you had to reach for a great revisionist mountain to climb, that would be it,\u201d said the presidential historian Michael Beschloss dryly.When it comes to the long view of presidential achievement, you have to turn to the historians \u2014 people who have managed to acquire strong opinions about Millard Fillmore and Benjamin Harrison. We obviously can\u2019t tell yet where Obama will rank. If the Affordable Care Act works out over the long run, he could do very well. Certainly nothing that\u2019s happened so far in his presidency would put him anywhere near the bottom. Most of the chief executives who dwell there came from the Civil War era \u2014 like Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, who sided with the slave owners on the way in, or Andrew Johnson, who screwed things up on the way out. It doesn\u2019t seem fair that Warren Harding is stuck with them. His appointees presided over several really juicy political scandals, including Teapot Dome, which was both one of the worst corruption cases in American history as well as the one with the most interesting name. That was definitely bad, but not really in the same ballpark. His defenders, like Robenalt and Dean, point out that Harding was, for his time, extremely progressive when it came to racial issues. Plus he got the Senate to approve an international disarmament agreement, which seems impressive when viewed from an era in which the Senate is incapable of rubber-stamping the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities. Harding\u2019s longtime lover and correspondent, Carrie Phillips, was a German sympathizer during World War I and Robenalt thinks she was actually a German spy. Her family disagrees. Either way, it\u2019s pretty clear from the letters that, while Harding loved her \u201cpillowing breasts,\u201d he had very little appreciation for her theories about foreign affairs. Nothing nearly that interesting appears to be going on in the current White House. Maybe the public is just bored. \u201cThe sixth year is tough for everybody,\u201d said Tim Malloy, a spokesman for the Quinnipiac University poll, which recently announced that it had surveyed 1,446 registered voters, about a third of whom thought Obama is the worst president since 1945. George W. Bush came in second at 28 percent. This isn\u2019t all that wide a margin, until you ask yourself who was running the show when the economy crashed and Iraq got invaded. After the results came in, Malloy said, the researchers looked back at recent two-term presidents and concluded that all of them bottomed out in the middle of their second term. It makes sense that in a world of incessant communication, there\u2019s just so much you can take of any chief executive. The guy we\u2019ve been stuck with for a long time seems awful, because he\u2019s the guy we\u2019ve been stuck with for a long time. Our attitude toward him doesn\u2019t improve until we\u2019ve been reminded that things could be much worse.

{"Headline": "In a First Since the 1990s, a Large Bulgarian Bank Goes Bankrupt", "Date": "2014-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a tumultuous month for the Bulgarian financial sector during which thousands of fearful depositors lined up to pull their savings out of two banks, the country\u2019s central bank has said it will start bankruptcy proceedings against one of the lenders.The failure of Corporate Commercial Bank, the country\u2019s fourth-largest lender, will be the first banking collapse in the East European country since the 1990s.The decision to fold Corporate Commercial Bank, known as K.T.B., came after an audit showed that records relating to most of the bank\u2019s loan portfolio were missing, the central bank said on Friday. The central bank, the Bulgarian National Bank, also accused the lender\u2019s biggest shareholder of taking more than $136 million in cash from the bank\u2019s vaults before the run last month.The central bank, which assumed control of K.T.B. on June 20, after more than 20 percent of its deposits were withdrawn in a week, said it was planning to move the bank\u2019s healthy assets to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Bulgaria, which K.T.B. acquired from the French banking giant Cr\u00e9dit Agricole just a week before the run. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Bulgaria, which is in the process of changing its name, will be nationalized and reopened on July 21, the central bank said.\u201cWe cannot continue to fill a barrel without a bottom, as the wise Bulgarian people say,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. \u201cThe Bulgarian National Bank together with the government will concentrate on the restructuring and rehabilitation of the \u2018good part\u2019 of Corporate Commercial Bank to protect the interest of all its depositors.\u201dThe rescue, though, will come with a hefty price tag: Bulgaria will spend up to 2 billion leva, or $1.4 billion, potentially doubling the country\u2019s deficit this year to more than 3 percent of gross domestic product, Finance Minister Petar Chobanov said on Friday.The banking crisis coincides with a period of political instability in Bulgaria, a country of 7.3 million. The Socialist-led government of Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski is expected to resign soon, after an agreement among the country\u2019s main political parties to hold early elections on Oct. 5.Convoluted political intrigue is believed to be behind the run on K.T.B., which later spread to First Investment Bank, or F.I.B., the country\u2019s third-largest financial institution.Panicked depositors withdrew the equivalent of $276 million in a matter of hours from First Investment Bank on June 27, but the bank kept its doors open after assurances of support from the government.The run on K.T.B. began after the local news outlets reported on a feud between Tsvetan Vassilev, the bank\u2019s biggest shareholder, and Delyan Peevski, a media mogul and member of Parliament. Mr. Peevski accused Mr. Vassilev of hiring people to kill him, and Mr. Vassilev has made similar accusations against Mr. Peevski.On Friday, the Bulgarian National Bank accused Mr. Vassilev of taking more than 200 million leva from K.T.B.\u2019s vaults in sacks containing euros, leva and dollars.In an open letter to the news media, Mr. Vassilev denied the allegations against him.Orlin Rusev, chairman of K.T.B.\u2019s management board, was detained in Bulgaria\u2019s Black Sea resort of Sozopol on Friday in relation to Mr. Vassilev\u2019s withdrawal of funds, state prosecutors said. Three more people were arrested over the weekend, news media reported.The runs on the two banks increased concerns of a repeat of Bulgaria\u2019s devastating banking crisis of 1996. Caused by government mismanagement of the economy, the crisis led to the bankruptcy of more than a dozen Bulgarian banks and months of hyperinflation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "College Debt and Home Buying", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMortgagesSwelling student loan debt is commonly cited as a primary factor in the declining homeownership rate among 25- to 34-year-olds. But are the two really related?Over the same period, student debt soared by more than 400 percent to top $1 trillion \u2014 a run-up that dwarfs the surge in mortgage debt during the housing bubble, said John Dyer, the lending practice lead for the Carlisle & Gallagher Consulting Group, which serves the financial services industry. He predicts the debt level will be a drag on home buying for years to come.The so-called millennial generation born after 1980 has proved more reliant on student loans, Mr. Dyer said, in part because of rising education costs, a prolonged weak economy and higher unemployment. And a high debt burden makes it difficult to afford a home or qualify for a mortgage.\u201cWhat seems to be happening is you have a pause in your housing pipeline,\u201d Mr. Dyer said. \u201cWhere a younger generation would normally be buying homes, it\u2019s just not happening.\u201dShe said she has looked at young-adult homeownership rates over a longer period, and found that the reversal cited by the Fed is \u201ca return to a longstanding trend that existed prior to 2004.\u201d For most of the last 20 years, homeownership rates among young households with student loan debt have been lower, not higher, than rates among households with no debt, she said.Extremely high burdens are still rare. In 2010, about 75 percent of households with people ages 20 to 40 who have education debt owed $20,000 or less, Ms. Akers said. Only 2 percent were carrying more than $100,000.Perhaps the declining number of young homeowners has more to do with the weak economy and tight lending conditions. Mr. Dyer predicts that mortgage lenders will gradually ease credit standards over the next five years to open up the \u201cbuy box\u201d to more young adults. But what and when they will buy will likely be different from the choices of generations past. \u201cThis generation has what some would label a fear of debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThey try to be very conscious and pragmatic about what they buy and how much they agree to borrow.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama, on Texas Trip, Will Face Immigration Critics", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 President Obama is traveling to Texas on Wednesday and will come face-to-face with liberal and conservative critics of his government\u2019s handling of a humanitarian crisis on the southern border, including Gov. Rick Perry.Just a day after Mr. Obama asked Congress for nearly $4 billion to address the influx of unaccompanied children, aides continue to say the president will not travel the extra distance to the Texas-Mexico border to see the detention centers where thousands of Central American immigrants have been held. He will, however, attend a previously planned immigration meeting in Dallas, as well as Democratic fund-raisers there and later in Austin.Before leaving for Texas, Mr. Obama spoke to an audience of invited officials in Denver about an economy showing some renewed strength \u2013 his intended message before the border crisis built in recent days.\u201cSo far this year Republicans in Congress have blocked or voted down every serious idea to strengthen the middle class,\u201d Mr. Obama said, citing their opposition to measures for a higher minimum wage, pay equity, unemployment insurance and an immigration overhaul. He mentioned the House Republican leaders\u2019 lawsuit against him for taking executive actions, saying that instead of \u201cpolitical stunts\u201d they should work together.Mr. Obama also attended the first of three fund-raisers on his three-day Western swing, this one for Senator Mark Udall of Colorado. Mr. Udall, who like a number of Democrats is struggling for re-election against the headwinds of Mr. Obama\u2019s low poll ratings, did not attend; he stayed in Washington for a vote. Mr. Udall\u2019s race is among those that will determine whether Democrats retain control of the Senate.Mr. Obama will reach Dallas by late afternoon and meet with local officials and representatives of faith groups concerned, like many Democrats, that the children \u2013 mostly from Guatemala and Honduras \u2013 are handled humanely at a time when many on the right, including congressional Republicans, are calling for immediate deportations.Mr. Perry, a potential aspirant for the Republicans\u2019 2016 presidential nomination, has emerged as one of the president\u2019s loudest critics. He has accused Mr. Obama\u2019s administration of not securing the borders, even as Latino groups assail the president for his administration\u2019s record of deporting nearly 2 million people who are in the United States illegally.Mr. Perry is trying to overcome an image among some Republicans that he is too soft on immigration. His presidential campaign in 2012 failed in part because of criticism of his policies, like tuition benefits for Latinos brought into Texas as children.On Tuesday, before Mr. Obama left Washington, Josh Earnest, the press secretary, said that \u201cthere should be a level at which we can agree that it\u2019s important for this humanitarian situation to be addressed.\u201d He dismissed Mr. Perry\u2019s remarks that Mr. Obama had caused the crisis, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that any fair appraisal of the president\u2019s record when it comes to border security would allow that criticism to withstand any scrutiny at all.\u201dAt the Capitol, however, House Republican leaders refused to commit to passing the president\u2019s request for emergency funds. They expressed skepticism not only about the components he seeks \u2013 additional money for immigration courts, detention centers, border surveillance, action against criminal networks transporting migrants and care of detainees \u2013 but also about a separate 2012 executive order of Mr. Obama\u2019s.That order deferred deportation of young illegal residents who were brought to this country as infants or children, many of them in college and the military and known among advocates as Dreamers.\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to take a serious look at what needs to happen,\u201d House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t secure the border, nothing\u2019s going to change. If you look at the president\u2019s request, it\u2019s all more not continuing to deal with the problem.\u201dRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California, soon to be the House majority leader, said in a brief interview that the executive order had sent a message to Central American countries: \u201cYou can send your children here.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop the flow,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think of the challenges these children have going through the desert. How many are dying? How many are being taken for human trafficking? What\u2019s the safety? If you really want to protect these children, we need them back with their families.\u201dWhite House officials said that the 2012 executive order for illegal residents who have been in the country for years had nothing to do with encouraging the more recent stream of children from strife-torn and impoverished Central American countries. Officials say crime networks are much to blame, enticing families to send their children to the United States.Until the influx reached crisis proportions this summer, many congressional Republicans otherwise opposed to a comprehensive overhaul of immigration, like a bipartisan bill the Senate passed a year ago, were open to some accommodation for the so-called Dreamers, especially those who enlisted in the military. The issue has been prominently used against Representative Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, who is seeking Mr. Udall\u2019s Senate seat, and also Representative Mike Coffman, another Colorado Republican who seeks re-election in a Denver-area district with significant numbers of Latino voters.But now national Republican leaders see an opening to further weaken Mr. Obama and, by extension, his party\u2019s candidates, by blaming him for the problem. Instead of compromising on the issues behind the 2012 executive order, Republicans talk of blocking the deferrals. The House has voted in the past to do so, but the Democratic-controlled Senate has not.An earlier version of this article misstated the year of Governor Rick Perry\u2019s presidential campaign. It was 2012, not 2008.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Build We Won\u2019t", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd the appropriate policy response was simple, too: Fill that hole in demand. In particular, the aftermath of the bursting bubble was (and still is) a very good time to invest in infrastructure. In prosperous times, public spending on roads, bridges and so on competes with the private sector for resources. Since 2008, however, our economy has been awash in unemployed workers (especially construction workers) and capital with no place to go (which is why government borrowing costs are at historic lows). Putting those idle resources to work building useful stuff should have been a no-brainer.How did things go so wrong? As with so many of our problems, the answer is the combined effect of rigid ideology and scorched-earth political tactics. The highway fund crisis is just one example of a much broader problem.But no. We can\u2019t simply write a check to the highway fund, we\u2019re told, because that would increase the deficit. And deficits are evil, at least when there\u2019s a Democrat in the White House, even if the government can borrow at incredibly low interest rates. And we can\u2019t raise gas taxes because that would be a tax increase, and tax increases are even more evil than deficits. So our roads must be allowed to fall into disrepair.If this sounds crazy, that\u2019s because it is. But similar logic lies behind the overall plunge in public investment. Most such investment is carried out by state and local governments, which generally must run balanced budgets and saw revenue decline after the housing bust. But the federal government could have supported public investment through deficit-financed grants, and states themselves could have raised more revenue (which some but not all did). The collapse of public investment was, therefore, a political choice.What\u2019s useful about the looming highway crisis is that it illustrates just how self-destructive that political choice has become. It\u2019s one thing to block green investment, or high-speed rail, or even school construction. I\u2019m for such things, but many on the right aren\u2019t. But everyone from progressive think tanks to the United States Chamber of Commerce thinks we need good roads. Yet the combination of anti-tax ideology and deficit hysteria (itself mostly whipped up in an attempt to bully President Obama into spending cuts) means that we\u2019re letting our highways, and our future, erode away.

{"Headline": "BlaBlaCar, a Ride-Sharing Start-Up in Europe, Looks to Expand Its Map", "Date": "2014-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In France, Charlotte Jurdieu has become part of the millions in the sharing economy.Twice a month, Ms. Jurdieu, 26, drives her Vauxhall Astra from Paris to her hometown in the Alsace region of eastern France to visit her family and boyfriend. And in the passenger seats of her small car come fellow customers of a French start-up company, BlaBlaCar, which has created an online ride-sharing service to match drivers like her with passengers in need of a ride.Founded in Paris in 2006, the company aims to connect people who want to share long-distance journeys. It is also active in Russia, Germany, Poland and eight other European countries.BlaBlaCar plans to announce on Wednesday that it has raised $100 million in new investment from a group of European and American venture firms, including Accel Partners and Index Ventures.While sharing start-ups like Uber and Airbnb have met regulatory resistance with their business plans, BlaBlaCar operates differently, forbidding participants to profit from the ride-sharing service. Instead, drivers share the costs of their trips and riders often pay less than they would have using public transportation.\u201cI\u2019m a lot cheaper than the train,\u201d said Ms. Jurdieu, one of more than eight million Europeans who now use BlaBlaCar. One-way train tickets from Paris to Alsace can cost more than a third more than what she charges for the same route. \u201cAs it\u2019s a long time to spend in a car, traveling with people also makes the time go faster.\u201dThe company\u2019s English name, which it uses regardless of the country where it operates, comes from how chatty people are when sharing journeys. If passengers do not want to talk during the trip, they can mark in their profiles that they are only \u201cBla,\u201d to denote that they are not looking for much conversation. Or they can go a full \u201cBlaBlaBla\u201d when they are happy to chatter throughout the trip.Users like Ms. Jurdieu complete online profiles that tell others whether they have a vehicle or are looking for a ride. People can post when and where they are going, and others can then sign up to share rides.The driver posts a price per seat, people pay up front \u2014 online, in some cases \u2014 and BlaBlaCar takes a 12 percent cut of each trip.The typical journey \u2014 mostly between large European cities like Munich and Hamburg, Germany \u2014 is less than 200 miles, and the company says that more than a million people use the service each month. The largest markets, each with more than a million users, are France, Germany and Spain.\u201cThe need we\u2019re trying to address is universal, and the market is massive,\u201d said Nicolas Brusson, a founder of BlaBlaCar. He said the company planned to use the new investment to expand across Europe and into emerging markets like Brazil and India where transport infrastructure is poor. \u201cCountries like Turkey have many similar features to where we operate in Europe and Russia.\u201dThe rise of BlaBlaCar, which does not yet have plans to offer its service in the United States, is part of a growing trend of companies that are tapping into the so-called sharing economy.American companies like the apartment-sharing service Airbnb and the ride-sharing company Lyft have quickly spread across the United States and overseas, as more people look for alternatives to traditional services from the likes of hotels and taxis.In response, Uber says it is offering greater choice for consumers in a heavily regulated industry that has seen little technological innovation for decades.As BlaBlaCar does not allow drivers to profit from the ride-sharing service, the company says it does not face the same regulatory and tax problems that companies like Uber are facing in the United States and Europe.The company caps how much drivers can charge passengers per route to ensure they cannot overcharge to make a profit from each journey. Instead, the company says, users can break even only on journeys by splitting the cost with other travelers, after BlaBlaCar takes its percentage.Passengers are covered under the driver\u2019s existing insurance policy, which the company says does not need to be changed to take part in the ride-sharing service.\u201cIt\u2019s a model where people aren\u2019t participating to make money, but to save money,\u201d said Dominique Vidal, a partner at Index Ventures. \u201cThat\u2019s fundamentally different to other sharing-economy companies.\u201dThe company also had to try to address customer concerns about safety, particularly among female passengers worried about getting into a car with a stranger.\u201cWe take safety extremely seriously,\u201d said Mr. Brusson, who added that women can choose to share vehicles only with other women. \u201cPeople rely a lot on peer reviews. It\u2019s the first thing people check when they want to find a car.\u201dAs it looks to expand into new markets, BlaBlaCar says it is drawing lessons from Russia, where despite the geopolitical tensions, it has attracted about 250,000 users since its debut in February and expects to hit one million subscribers by the end of the year. To aid that growth, the company acquired a local Russian rival \u2014 an approach it is likely to follow in other countries it enters, according to Mr. Brusson. When one customer, Dzmitry Bazhko, signed up with BlaBlaCar, he was looking for a cheap way to travel from Moscow to his hometown, Minsk, the capital of Belarus. After previously spending 12 hours on that train journey, Mr. Bazhko said he was surprised that the shared car trip took less than half the time \u2014 and was almost a third of what the train ticket would have cost.\u201cI don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license, and the train can be really expensive,\u201d said Mr. Bazhko, 27, who works for Airbnb in Moscow. \u201cSo far, it\u2019s the cheapest way I\u2019ve found to get back home.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bouncing Back, Economy Grew 4% for Quarter", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States economy rebounded strongly in the second quarter of the year, shaking off the negative effects of an unusually harsh winter and stirring hopes that it might finally be establishing a solid enough footing to put the lingering effects of the recession squarely in the past.The Commerce Department, in its initial estimate for April, May and June, reported on Wednesday that the economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 percent, surpassing expectations. During the first quarter, output shrank at a rate of 2.1 percent, less than had been reported. The department had earlier said that first-quarter output fell 2.9 percent.Some experts, citing a range of indicators including an improving job market, were encouraged by the signs of healthy business investment and consumer spending, but others cautioned that the economy had yet to break out of an underlying pattern of steady but relatively sluggish growth that has plagued the nation since the Great Recession officially ended in mid-2009.President Obama heralded the positive economic news on a visit to Kansas City, Mo. Federal Reserve policy makers, meeting this week in Washington, said they were taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the latest data, emphasizing concern about the millions of Americans who still cannot find jobs.In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, the Fed acknowledged that growth had \u201crebounded,\u201d but its tone was measured and it made clear that it had no plans to raise interest rates anytime soon. It described the chances of faster growth as roughly even with the chances that the expansion would slow down. \u201cThe recovery so far has been unspectacular,\u201d said Ben Herzon, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm based in St. Louis. \u201cWith the exception of a few wiggles here and there, it\u2019s been on this steady growth path, which is not great but it\u2019s been good enough.\u201dDemocrats are hoping to use the signs of an improving economy as a selling point in the run-up to midterm elections as proof their policies are working. Mr. Obama seemed energized by the report, though even his take was muted. He said a healthy jobs market was the real measure of whether the economy was working.\u201cI\u2019m glad that G.D.P. is growing, and I\u2019m glad that corporate profits are high, and I\u2019m glad that the stock market is booming,\u201d the president told a boisterous crowd in Kansas City. \u201cBut what I really want to see is a guy working 9 to 5, and then working some overtime. I want that guy making more than the minimum wage.\u201dConsumer spending on automobiles, furniture and recreational goods helped bolster G.D.P. for the second quarter, as did an increase in state and local government expenditures that offset a modest decline in federal spending. But the biggest factor in the quarterly expansion was a sharp increase in the stocks of goods in warehouses and on store shelves as businesses anticipated that consumers were developing a greater urge to shop.The rate at which businesses stock their shelves can be volatile, and the second-quarter gains could falter if consumers do not continue to spend freely in the second half of the year. For all the exuberance over Wednesday\u2019s news, at least one economist chalked up the latest numbers mostly to \u201cpayback\u201d for the poor showing in the first quarter. Looking back over the last 12 months, the overall inflation-adjusted output of goods and services for the second quarter was 2.4 percent higher than the same quarter a year earlier, barely ahead of the average pace of 2.2 percent growth since the recession ended.Still, most economists say that \u2014 little by little \u2014 the economy is returning to a healthier state.\u201cIt isn\u2019t something people are going to get excited about, but it does represent honest, real progress,\u201d said Michael Gapen, a senior economist for Barclays, which predicted more of the same for the rest of the year. Perhaps the biggest factor holding back the economy has been slow wage growth, as the high number of people out of work means that businesses see little need to pay much more to attract new employees. Housing has partly recovered from the depths it fell to during the recession but has not significantly helped power the economy forward as it did in the early stages of past expansions. Second-quarter earnings for many companies have been mixed. Labor conditions continue to be underwhelming, contributing to the belief of many jobless Americans that the economy is leaving them behind.Bob Baur, chief global economist for Principal Global Investors, made up a name for what he thinks has been holding back both consumers and businesses from the more exuberant kind of spending that would help close the gap of as much as $1 trillion between the economy\u2019s current level and its larger capacity for generating goods and services without setting off a significant rise in inflation. He called it \u201cpost-crisis relapse disorder,\u201d which he defined as behavior based on the expectation that the economic outlook will be grim merely because it has been so grim for months before.But the company\u2019s figures cover only private businesses and often do not track with the government\u2019s jobs report, which will be released Friday morning.

The current crisis has been developing for years and was entirely predictable.Even if the drought eventually ends, California and its cities and towns should pass laws and implement regulations eliminating lawns or restricting them to a small portion of a residential lot. Laws requiring low-flow toilets, showers, faucets and appliances have been effective in reducing indoor residential water use.

{"Headline": "Marijuana Clubs Rise Out of Decades-Old Spanish Laws", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBarcelona JournalBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 On a recent evening, two vacationing German college students, armed with addresses they had gotten off the Internet, were trying to get into one of Barcelona\u2019s new marijuana clubs.They were not members. But no matter. They quickly found a club near the city\u2019s central boulevard, La Rambla, that was willing to ignore the rules, helping them choose from a dozen strains of marijuana for sale in plastic bins before letting them settle into the cushy lounge area to light up.Forty-five minutes later, they were back on the street, smiling. \u201cIt was very nice,\u201d said one of the students, who had researched cannabis clubs before choosing Barcelona as a holiday destination. \u201cWe will go back tomorrow.\u201dThe number of cannabis clubs that have opened in Barcelona recently has some experts saying this city will soon challenge Amsterdam as the go-to destination for vacationers who want to get high in peace.It is not that Barcelona officials have given their blessing to this new phenomenon. The clubs are operating under decades-old Spanish laws that allow anyone to grow and smoke marijuana in private or to band together with others to form a cannabis club, as long as it is a nonprofit organization for members only, something like a chess or a cooking club.But in the last three years, new clubs have opened, particularly in tourist areas like La Rambla, in many cases circumventing the spirit, if not the letter, of the law. While some clubs refuse walk-in customers like the German college students, many of them offer membership (about 20 euros, or about $27) over the Internet or by phone.The clubs vary enormously, from basement rooms equipped with foosball tables and huge television sets, to more elegant settings with designer chandeliers and fresh fruit drink bars. Some give marijuana away to those who use it for medical purposes and see a business in this area. Others cater only to recreational users. Few of the clubs are noticeable from the street.The Rambla Dragon Club, for instance, which opened last year, is on the ground floor of an apartment building. Only a small sign over the doorbell (as well as the constant presence of young people squinting to read it) indicates its presence. It has the feel of a Starbucks without windows, its high ceilings and a mighty ventilation system keeping the air fresh. Some of the smokers sit at tables with their laptops open. Others sit in on sofas, watching movies on a giant screen.Some cannabis advocates say the clubs are a bright spot in the economy. Though they are nonprofits, advocates say the clubs are generating thousands of jobs and tax revenues for the state. In addition to selling a wide array of cannabis products and hashish, many of the clubs also sell food and drinks and offer extras to their members, like live music nights and Pilates classes.Albert Ti\u00f3, the president of Fedcac, an association of cannabis clubs in the region of Catalonia that includes Barcelona, said the clubs now had 165,000 members, up from virtually none five years ago. His association was formed in 2011, with only a handful of clubs in existence, he said.One reason for the growth, he said, was that young people saw the clubs as a way to make a living. Another factor, he said, was Barcelona\u2019s new antismoking laws, which went into effect in bars and restaurants in January 2011 and sent cannabis smokers, who are often also tobacco smokers, looking for new places to congregate.\u201cThe reality is this,\u201d Mr. Ti\u00f3 said. \u201cConsumers think this is better than buying drugs on the street.\u201dRegional officials say that many of the clubs do cater mostly to Spaniards, including one club in which all the members are women in their 80s. But Barcelona officials are so concerned about the rapid increase in such establishments and this city\u2019s growing reputation as a place to get a legal high that they decided in June to put a one-year moratorium on new licenses while they consider issues such as proximity to schools.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Joan Delort, the head of prevention, security and mobility for Barcelona. \u201cIn a very few years, you have a huge registration of cannabis users. It is very hard to determine what is really going on. But in 18 months, you have clubs that are in a very small location, that have registered 4,000 members. It\u2019s just impossible that they could have that many.\u201dSome of the biggest names in the marijuana world are here. The Strain Hunters, for instance, a Dutch group that makes documentaries about the hunt for native strains of marijuana around the world, opened a club here in March, on a charming side street not far from La Rambla.With one-way windows that give the space an open and airy feel, but prevents passers-by from looking in, it has the look and the feel of an upscale bar. For those who want to get an early start, coffee and fresh croissants are available for breakfast, and members can opt for rarer cannabis products, such as pure cannabis resin in the shape of a butterfly.Websites that review the clubs, such as MarijuanaGames.org and WeBeHigh.org, are giving Barcelona clubs high marks for both the quality and the variety of cannabis products they sell, as well as for offering a far more pleasant atmosphere than most Amsterdam coffee shops, which they say usually offer stale marijuana.On a recent morning, Olivier Vervaet, a 21-year-old nightclub worker, was at the Strain Hunters Club looking over the cannabis menu while having a coffee. \u201cI joined because this was just a great place to relax,\u201d he said. \u201cI can sit down, and someone will bring me a drink and a joint, and I don\u2019t have to worry about the police.\u201dA few times a month, the police have stepped in, taking action against clubs caught leafleting on the street, for instance. But Edward Sallent, the inspector general of community policing for the Catalan regional police, said it was difficult to move against the clubs. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex situation because a lot of the acts and behaviors are not forbidden,\u201d he said. \u201cSelling and trafficking are illegal, but consumption, no.\u201dMany advocates say they believe the clubs are cutting down on street sales. But Mr. Sallent says he doubts that. He says the clubs are too new to know exactly what impact they will have. \u201cThere may be all kinds of costs,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it will affect the value of property. Who knows?\u201dSome of those involved in managing the clubs in Barcelona hope that Spain will go further in legalizing marijuana soon. Though the clubs are run as nonprofit entities, some clearly represent big investments. One such club, RMD, has set up an area for members who use marijuana to soothe the effects of chemotherapy or for other medical purposes.It even hired a doctor to discuss their marijuana use and to help them with any issues that might arise. Tony Levi, who coordinates this aspect of the club, said he became interested in the medical benefits of cannabis when his father had cancer.He says he believes that eventually Spain will recognize cannabis for medical use and that the services the club is providing will be covered by insurance. \u201cI do see a business model here,\u201d he said.Rachel Chaundler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Global Slowdown in Medical Costs", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthWe tend to think of health care as a local good. Most people use the doctor or hospital in their neighborhood. China does not export medical care. Health and life spans differ from country to country, even county to county.But when it comes to health care spending, the picture is starting to look more global. After decades when health spending in the United States grew much faster than it did in other Western countries, a new pattern has emerged in the last two decades. And it has become particularly pronounced since the economic crisis. The rate of health cost growth has slowed substantially since 2000 in every high-income country, including the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\u201cWe used to be different,\u201d said Louise Sheiner, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve. \u201cSince about 1990, we\u2019ve looked about the same.\u201dWhat\u2019s behind the pattern? Economic growth around the industrialized world has been slow for much of the last decade, and the aging of the population in much of the world has also created fiscal pressures to rein in health spending. But these economic and political forces \u2014 which in turn leave governments and households with less money to purchase medical care \u2014 do not appear to be the only causes.The world\u2019s health-care systems are also converging in important ways. New drugs and medical advances, which were once adopted locally and spread more slowly, are now experiencing international launches. Medical technology companies are increasingly global, and seeing regulatory approval in many markets at once. Strategies that can reduce the need for expensive hospital stays, such as performing surgeries in outpatient clinics, are expanding around the world.Findings from medical research and the ways that doctors practice are also spreading faster and wider. \u201cWe\u2019re learning from other countries, and the best practices take a year or two to diffuse, whereas in the past they might have taken five or 10 years,\u201d said Gerard Anderson, a public health professor at Johns Hopkins. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a convergence because of a more rapid diffusion of information.\u201dIn the United States, the health spending slowdown has eased workers\u2019 insurance rate increases and taken the pressure off the federal budget deficit. Health economists here are puzzling over the precise causes of the current slowdown. But they largely agree on a few factors.The economic crisis drove down demand for new medical services, as people lost their jobs and coverage, or simply decided to put off elective procedures like knee replacements. Tougher times also led to policy tightening by federal and state officials \u2014 and employers, who have increasingly moved from generous health insurance plans to those that expose their workers to more out-of-pocket costs.The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, expands coverage to new people, but over the last few years, it has also cut back on spending in Medicare, much of it from lower reimbursements to hospitals and insurers. The law also includes attempts to make the medical system more efficient by reducing forms of care that do not make people healthier.At the same time, the development of new expensive medical technologies has slowed for a decade or so. That trend has been most pronounced in the pharmaceutical market. Many big blockbuster drugs lost their patent protection, including Lipitor, the best-selling drug in history. Few expensive, mass-market medications have come to replace them.Many of these same forces affect other countries. They also had fewer new drugs, devices and procedures to adopt. And their economies were slammed by the global recession.Other countries also have political mechanisms to reduce spending. With great political controversy, the Affordable Care Act tries to mimic some of these mechanisms, such as a board of experts that will consider whether treatments are effective. Most other countries have aggressive regulatory systems that allow government officials to tamp down health spending directly when times get tough.Still, the similarities among countries are not the same thing as destiny. \u201cHealth care slowed down here and it slowed down there, and that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all entirely cyclical,\u201d said Peter Orszag, a vice chairman at Citibank and a former top official at the federal Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office, at a meeting of health economists this week.Mr. Orszag, an architect of the Affordable Care Act, says the American spending slowdown has been caused in part by changes in the practice of medicine that go deeper than economic and technological trends. He hopes the United States will be able to sustain those changes and keep spending growth low far into the future, whatever the rest of the world does.But the growing globalization of health spending means it may be hard for the United States to pull away from whatever international trend comes next. And that means policy makers here should shy away from declaring victory just yet.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aid From Massachusetts in New Hampshire Race", "Date": "2014-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTRATHAM, N.H. \u2014 It was a bit of an odd tableau: a former Massachusetts governor endorsing a former Massachusetts senator to represent the people of New Hampshire in the United States Senate.On a day so hot that Mr. Romney began talking about global warming, Mr. Brown, who just declared New Hampshire his official residence seven months ago, told the former governor: \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you back in New Hampshire. You have a lot of friends in our state, and I\u2019m proud to be one of them.\u201dMr. Romney, in endorsing his fellow Republican\u2019s candidacy, bemoaned the state of the economy and America\u2019s place in the world during the Obama presidency, and praised Mr. Brown as \u201csomeone who I know well, a terrific American, an independent voice, an independent thinker.\u201dThe rally, held at Scamman\u2019s Bittersweet Farm just days before the Fourth of July, was staged in front of a picturesque white barn draped with an enormous American flag. Mr. Brown was played in and out with a song, \u201cPride of America,\u201d recorded by his daughter, Ayla, a onetime \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d contestant. A Boy Scout troop grilled hot dogs; a veteran led the Pledge of Allegiance; and voters donned 2012 Romney/Ryan gear, as well as 2014 Brown stickers, for the festivities. At one point during the rally, a plane flew overhead towing a banner that read \u201cGo Scott Go,\u201d prompting the crowd to chant those words.Mr. Brown\u2019s supporters repeatedly praised him as independent \u2014 a treasured trait in a swing state whose motto is \u201cLive Free or Die.\u201d In interviews, several people at the rally expressed hostility toward Mr. Obama, and said they wished Mr. Romney had won the 2012 election; they said they were not concerned about Mr. Brown\u2019s recent move to the state, noting the porousness of the Massachusetts-New Hampshire border and the many people who move from one state to the other.\u201cHe has an aptitude to work with the opposition \u2014 he\u2019s not a strident Tea Party politician,\u201d said Paul Clark, 80, of Nashua, a Brown campaign volunteer. And Rory Pelley of Auburn said: \u201cI\u2019m a moderate Republican, so I think moderate Republicans are great. I\u2019m tired of the extremes.\u201dMr. Brown, with sweat dripping off his brow and soaking through his button-down shirt, used the 91-degree weather as a symbol, saying \u201cthe heat is nothing like Senator Shaheen is going to feel in November.\u201dHe and his supporters made it clear that their main line of attack would be to tie Ms. Shaheen to Mr. Obama. Mr. Brown said, \u201cShe\u2019s a very nice person, she is just not the independent voice that she promised to be.\u201dA former New Hampshire governor, John Sununu, who attended the rally, made the point more sharply, saying in an interview, \u201cShe has bought completely into the Obama agenda.\u201dMs. Shaheen\u2019s campaign spokesman, Harrell Kirstein, defended her voting record, saying, \u201cJeanne Shaheen puts New Hampshire first, and she does what she thinks is right for people here.\u201d\u201cMitt Romney was a very popular candidate among Republicans in the presidential primary here, and he drew across a wide range of Republicans,\u201d Mr. Scala said. \u201cHis endorsement is a symbol of the party establishment\u2019s blessing of Brown\u2019s candidacy.\u201dBut Mr. Scala said the endorsement was not likely to be as influential in the general election, and noted that Ms. Shaheen, a former governor who is probably the best-known politician in the state, has been looking strong. \u201cShaheen is a Democrat who, so far, is proving to hold steady,\u201d he said, \u201cdespite the fact that the environment for Democrats nationally has deteriorated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nonetheless, debt and deficits have faded from the news. And there\u2019s a good reason for that disappearing act: The whole thing turns out to have been a false alarm.About those projections: The budget office predicts that this year\u2019s federal deficit will be just 2.8 percent of G.D.P., down from 9.8 percent in 2009. It\u2019s true that the fact that we\u2019re still running a deficit means federal debt in dollar terms continues to grow \u2014 but the economy is growing too, so the budget office expects the crucial ratio of debt to G.D.P. to remain more or less flat for the next decade.In short, the debt apocalypse has been called off.But that was more than four years ago, and both inflation and interest rates remain low. Maybe the United States, which among other things borrows in its own currency and therefore can\u2019t run out of cash, isn\u2019t much like Greece after all.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Plan to Limit Coal Use Could Spur Consumption for Years", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Under pressure to reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions, the Chinese government is considering a mandatory cap on coal use, the main source of carbon pollution from fossil fuels. But it would be an adjustable ceiling that would allow coal consumption to grow for years, and policy makers are at odds on how long the nation\u2019s emissions will rise.Senior officials are debating these issues as they formulate a new five-year development plan, to be finalized by the end of next year. China emits more carbon dioxide than any other country, so what President Xi Jinping and his colleagues decide will have far-reaching consequences for efforts to contain climate change.\u201cI think there\u2019s a broad consensus on this, and it\u2019s a question of how to implement it,\u201d said Professor Wang, who is a senior member of China\u2019s legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress. \u201cIf we can have a cap on coal, that would almost be equivalent to a cap on carbon, because coal is such a dominant source of pollution and emissions.\u201dThe coal cap would be stricter than current limits, which are not mandatory and are only loosely enforced. But it would be pegged to expected economic growth and energy demand, so coal use could keep rising for years.Chinese policy advisers remain divided about how quickly the country should move to cut coal consumption. Some officials fear stricter limits would drag down the economy. They cite the prospect of mine closings, job losses and energy shortfalls if alternative sources of energy, such as nuclear, hydroelectric and solar power, fail to deliver in time.\u201cThe real debate is about how to engage the big state-owned fossil-fuel companies, and also the big provinces whose economies are very, very dependent on these industries,\u201d Ms. Yang said.On the other side, some economists argue that bold efforts to reduce coal consumption would be an economic and environmental boon in the long term by encouraging new, clean modes of growth.And, experts say, there is new pressure on the government from rising domestic anger over smog. Coal burned in power plants, boilers and furnaces is a main source of the grimy pollution that swamps Beijing and other cities, and many steps to cut smog would also cut carbon emissions.\u201cThe whole air pollution situation has changed the debate dramatically,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more political space to argue for control measures.\u201dA dozen provinces and major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have already set firm limits on coal use or goals to reduce consumption.\u201cWithout a national cap, there is a real danger that coal production and air pollution will simply move to other parts of China,\u201d Ms. Finamore said.China\u2019s National Energy Administration called this year for research proposals for \u201ccaps for total energy and coal consumption for 2020, and a practical path for implementing caps on energy and coal consumption.\u201dA parallel debate is whether China should set a date for a peak in its carbon emissions, and if so, what that date should be. Other governments have pressed China to set a date so they can better map out how global greenhouse gas levels could rise.Governments negotiating a new climate change treaty have agreed to propose national contributions to emissions reduction as part of efforts to reach an agreement in Paris next year. Previous efforts have foundered in part because China and other large developing countries have refused to accept calls from rich nations to take on binding emission targets.Just how long they will rise is a question that divides experts, even those close to the government.At international talks in Copenhagen in 2009, governments agreed to try to hold greenhouse gas concentrations below levels likely to cause the average global temperature to rise 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the preindustrial average during this century.\u201cIf a coal cap can help us reach a peak in coal in 2020, we can be confident that the CO2 peak will be about 2025,\u201d said Yang Fuqiang, a former energy researcher for the Chinese government and now a senior adviser for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Beijing, referring to carbon dioxide.But several experts at Chinese government institutes said it would be too economically perilous to peak so soon, and two recent Chinese studies have said that any attempt to do so before 2030 would be impractical.\u201cIf you wanted a peak right now, China could do it by stopping economic growth,\u201d said Professor Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \u201cBut the price would be that the ordinary people would go out onto the streets.\u201dKiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Thank heavens, because there\u2019s a crisis at the border, and the Highway Trust Fund is about to expire. Plus, the Export-Import Bank is teetering on the brink of disaster. (Days ago, we had no idea there was an Export-Import Bank, let alone what it did. Now we\u2019re just getting acquainted, and they want to rip it away.)And, of course, a huge pile of normal stuff has piled up: hearings, meetings, appropriations bills, plots to destroy Obamacare. It\u2019s all a rush, given that Congress is scheduled to go on another five-week vacation beginning Aug. 1.So the House speaker, John Boehner, wants to get cracking on the matter of suing the president.I believe I speak for us all when I respond \u2014 say what? According to Boehner\u2019s memo to Republican troops, the crisis that calls out for formal litigation involves \u201cmatters ranging from health care and energy to foreign policy and education.\u201d Also, the president acting with \u201cking-like authority.\u201dFeel free to rant.\u201cSo sue me,\u201d said the president, when news of Boehner\u2019s alleged plan reached the White House. Remember when he first won the nomination by promising to end partisan gridlock? Do you think Hillary Clinton watches this stuff and laughs bitterly? On Wednesday, the president arrived in Texas, the epicenter of the humanitarian crisis involving a flood of Central American children crossing the Mexican border. He was there for some previously scheduled fund-raisers. Also feel free to rant about fund-raisers. The situation is terrible. More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have crossed the border since last fall. The administration is supposed to provide them with access to counsel and supervision by the Department of Health and Human Services while they\u2019re taken through the required legal channels. There\u2019s a two-year waiting list to see an immigration judge.Part of the backlog is because of a law passed at the end of the George W. Bush administration. We are not going to complain about this law, since it was aimed at combating child sex trafficking. If you\u2019re going to rant about George W. Bush, you should really focus on the invasion of Iraq and the ruining of the economy.President Obama has asked for $3.7 billion to take care of the children and hire more people to process the cases. Speaker Boehner countered that the president should call out the National Guard. That should be extremely helpful in discouraging the flood of young, desperate immigrants, who almost invariably throw themselves into the arms of the first American uniform they see.The House chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, called the president\u2019s request for money a \u201cslap in the face to the taxpayers of the United States.\u201d However, he did suggest that he might be able to maybe perhaps do something about fixing the current law. This was during a brief interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, in which Goodlatte used the word \u201ctweak\u201d three times.Boehner and the House Republicans do not appear to feel any compunction to revisit the Senate\u2019s bipartisan immigration reform bill. Or to take any responsibility for the current crisis. Since, you know, Obama has plenty of power and he should just use it and leave Congress alone.In Texas, the president met with Gov. Rick Perry, who has complained about the issue of children at the border. He has also suggested that the whole thing might be an Obama plot. (\u201c... I hate to be conspiratorial, but, I mean, how do you move that many people from Central America, across Mexico, into the United States without there being a fairly coordinated effort?\u201d)Feel free to rant about Rick Perry.Meanwhile, Sarah Palin announced that Congress should respond to the desperate humanitarian situation by \u2014 yes! \u2014 impeaching Obama. Boehner, she said dismissively, was trying to bring a \u201clawsuit to a gunfight.\u201d Always charming the way Palin brings guns into the political debate. Actually, if the impeachment idea caught on it would be the best possible thing for the White House. Modern history suggests there is nothing the American public hates more than Congress trying to impeach the president. Except maybe a Congress trying to sue the president.

Comcast\u2019s bold strategy of acquisition kicked off a wave of defensive consolidation, fueled by a combination of fear and abundant capital in the media realm. I talked to the head of one company that creates television and movies, who expressed a common sentiment. \u201cWhen Comcast decided to get bigger,\u201d he said, \u201cwe all had to ask ourselves, Are we big enough? We all have to think about getting bigger.\u201dAnd why not? No one is stopping them.For the most part, the current government has passed on regulating potential monopolies, and as citizens, we have become inured to the consequences of bigness. With technology behemoths like Facebook and Google owning part of our everyday lives, we can\u2019t get too wound up about which media outfit owns Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s show.The giant market capitalizations and market power residing in Silicon Valley have rippled into the rest of the economy. The people behind this sudden surge of proposed media mergers say they are only going on steroids to avoid getting sand kicked in their face by even bigger bullies in the technology world. Comcast will contend that it is not just competing with Cablevision and Charter Communications, but also with Google, Amazon and Apple. And people who make programming will assert that they are trying to grow just so they do not get pushed around by Comcast. Like the dragons in HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d big new digital players are hovering over the media landscape. You don\u2019t want to be wandering around with a tiny sword if your adversaries are airborne and fire-breathing. Many suggest that the only hedge in a consolidating world is high-quality content. \u201cRupert did not try to buy Time Warner because he wants to get to own a bunch of cable networks,\u201d Richard Greenfield of BTIG Research said. \u201cHe clearly feels that as other players try to enter the media business, content will be more valuable and he wants to get his hands on as much content as possible.\u201dBeyond bigness, there is no compelling logic driving a merger of Time Warner and 21st Century Fox. They are about the same size and neither would be filling strategic holes in the other\u2019s portfolio. But at 83, Mr. Murdoch continues to be a man in a hurry, and he likes to stir the pot. But that has left a company once thought of as a behemoth as takeover bait. The same things that make it attractive to Wall Street \u2014 a pure-play television and movie company \u2014 make it attractive to buyers as well. When you are not actively building a business, there\u2019s a pretty good chance you will end up as a brick in someone else\u2019s. And who is to say whether sometime soon, perhaps if Time Warner stays up for grabs, one of the Silicon Valley players will simply buy its own content factory instead of negotiating for rights with those already in the business? As silly and inefficient as the Hollywood system is \u2014 pilot season anyone? \u2014 no one else has determined how to make mass entertainment, other than the N.F.L. If you can\u2019t render them irrelevant, why not buy them? Of course, the execution risks are considerable. When I first started covering this beat at the turn of the century, it was clear that paradigms were shifting and the existing players had to respond, to do something, anything, to meet the coming challenge. That\u2019s when AOL and Time Warner decided to merge. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article contained outdated information.

You know the story.But here\u2019s the thing: While everyone has been shouting about the above (Ms. Mastromonaco has written an editorial in her defense), the very same issue, which is to say, a major public figure\u2019s relationship to fashion, has actually become something of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in France. But in this case, the public figure is a man.I offer as proof positive that these days sartorial politics is an equal opportunity arena (and taken equally seriously for both sexes) the recent hoo-ha over President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s new ... eyeglasses. Truth is, when it comes to image, male leaders are under scrutiny just as much as women are. Perhaps even more, as they have fewer options for self-expression, resulting in greater attention to every detail.A few weeks ago, Mr. Hollande swapped his clear rimless glasses for a geekier, horn-rimmed style. They are not as extreme as stereotypical black-framed architect\u2019s numbers, but they come close. And this started a vociferous debate among the French.The glasses, made by Lindberg, a Danish company whose glasses are also worn by Queen Elizabeth II, Bill Gates, Miuccia Prada and Brad Pitt, have been condemned by French businesses for being both unpatriotic and hypocritical. The glasses prove, Mr. Hollande\u2019s critics said, that he does not practice what he preaches: that is, supporting local industry. (The president made the somewhat ill-considered decision to do the glasses swap as his government embarked on a heightened Made in France push.)Instead, they continued, \u201cYou could have been an ambassador for French glasses and witness to the dynamism of our sector in France and beyond.\u201d They invited him to meet them at the Salon Mondiale de l\u2019Optique at the end of September to check out their wares.Another optician, Sabine B\u00e9gault-Vagner, stepped in and gave Mr. Hollande a model from her brand, Sabine Be, in the colors of the republic (red and blue) with a slightly more diplomatic note saying, \u201cI modestly propose you try a pair \u2018hand made in France\u2019 with much love.\u201dFor their part, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace-ologists have been speculating on the potential symbolism of the glasses swap. Is it about \u201crose-tinted nostalgia\u201d? asked the news channel France24, apropos of the retro style. Bruno Roger-Petit, a columnist in the weekly newsmagazine Le Nouvel Observateur, posited that the specs were a clear nod to the style of the politician Jacques Chirac in the golden years of French prosperity during the 1960s-70s, and thus \u201can object that embodies a clear relationship to a past perceived as positive, the nostalgia for an era of fun both prohibited and conquered.\u201d (This despite the fact that the last French leader to actually wear Lindberg glasses, albeit a different style, was Mr. Hollande\u2019s fellow socialist, Lionel Jospin, who was prime minister from 1997 to 2002; Mr. Chirac was the founder of the Gaullist party, Rally for the Republic.)What has not come up in all the discussions is the price of the glasses: $1,300, according to Peter Warrer, Lindberg\u2019s director of sales and marketing. That seems like a fair amount to spend on frames for a president who ran on the idea of a 75 percent \u201cmillionaires tax.\u201dSince the brouhaha began, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace has been engaged in some damage control, hinting to the disgruntled local manufacturers that the president would try out their brands as well, which leads to the somewhat unsettling picture of Mr. Hollande changing glasses daily, simply to prove his evenhandedness. This might work to satisfy his various constituencies, but if I were his adviser, I would argue against it, as it seems to open the door to all sort of potential flip-flopping charges. Better, really, to demonstrate a consistent point of view through dress.(The sheer existence of l\u2019affair lunettes suggests that perhaps Mr. Hollande\u2019s advisers are not as canny when it comes to image as they might be, and maybe the French should take a cue from the British, and start luring American spin doctors like David Axelrod and Jim Messina across the channel, because they are already across the Atlantic.)Possibly the fact that Mr. Hollande has actually been wearing Lindberg glasses for the last four years according to the company (those rimless numbers were theirs) might have led everyone involved to conclude the change of glasses would make no difference. My guess, however, is that they were a pre-existing condition on his election, and therefore not up for debate ... until he decided to change. At which point the manufacturers felt free to point out that he should have seized the day, and decision, to support French business.Indeed, I\u2019m surprised he hadn\u2019t considered it. I mean, it\u2019s not as if Mr. Hollande is a stranger to issues of sartorial spin, or the importance of the right pair of eyeglasses.He ran on an election platform of \u201cMr. Normal,\u201d after all: his blandness and slightly rumpled suits the visual counterpoint to the Nicolas Sarkozy \u201cPresident Bling-Bling\u201d schtick. And to get there Mr. Hollande nevertheless underwent his own pre-campaign makeover under the tutelage of his former partner, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, who helped him lose weight and settle on those rimless, rectangular Lindbergs. (Previously he had worn rounder, more goggly- eyed styles.)This suggests that the most recent glasses flipper-roo may actually have had to do with shedding some emotional baggage when Mr. Hollande\u2019s relationship with Ms. Trierweiler went south, a motivating factor that thus far has not been raised in the discussion. We have all been there, after all: dumping T-shirts or even shoes that remind us unhappily of a former lover. Indeed, Mr. Warrer seems to think this may be the case, seeing Mr. Hollande\u2019s switch as a sign \u201che wanted to renew himself.\u201dBut in the end, and whatever the motivation and the mistakes involved, the kerfuffle shows that it\u2019s not just first ladies who are seen as potential billboards for local industry (remember the outcry in the United States when Michelle Obama wore Alexander McQueen to the China state dinner?), but first executives, too.At a time when the global economy dictates that every possible tool in a national arsenal be used to increase employment and promote industry, it\u2019s a part of the job (admittedly unwritten) that should be taken seriously. Fact is, unlike Freud\u2019s supposed remark that sometimes a cigar is only a cigar, in politics a new accessory is never just a new accessory. It\u2019s always a symbol. No matter which gender it\u2019s on.The Unbuttoned column last Thursday, about the new eyeglasses worn by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, quoted incorrectly from a column by Bruno Roger-Petit in the magazine Nouvel Observateur in which he suggested that the glasses are meant to evoke positive memories of Jacques Chirac in the 1960s and \u201970s and the prosperity of the era. Mr. Roger-Petit referred to Mr. Chirac\u2019s leadership during that era; he did not say the prosperity of that era coincided with Mr. Chirac\u2019s presidency. (He was not elected to that position until 1995, and held it to May 2007.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Calm British Fears Over Immigrants", "Date": "2014-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyIf Britain leaves the European Union, the main reason will probably be because people fear immigrants are overrunning the country. The best way of assuaging these concerns is to show how the free movement of people within the European Union benefits the economy and society over all, while acknowledging that some groups may be harmed and working hard to improve their lot.So far, David Cameron\u2019s Conservative-led coalition has not done this effectively. The field has therefore been left open to the U.K. Independence Party, which wants to pull Britain out of the European Union, and which has cleverly fanned and exploited the native population\u2019s fears about immigration.There are multiple concerns. One is that immigrants are taking British jobs. Another is that they are \u201cscroungers,\u201d coming to live off benefits. Yet more fears are that they are depressing wages (especially among the low-skilled), responsible for a crime wave, making it harder for the native population to find homes to live in and overloading schools, hospitals and other public services.Most of these concerns are untrue or exaggerated when looking at the country as a whole, as the government\u2019s Migration Advisory Committee made clear in a report published last week. It focused on low-skilled immigration because that has been much more controversial than high-skilled migration.Take jobs. The number of British-born people in low-skilled employment fell by 1.1 million from 1997 to 2013. That is matched by a 1.1 million rise in the number of people in low-skilled employment born outside Britain (not just in other European Union countries).If one looked at just those statistics, one might think foreigners are taking British jobs. But the number of jobs is not fixed. In fact, it has grown sharply, by 3.3 million, in that period \u2014 mainly because a higher population generates more demand for goods and services.What is more, the growth has occurred in high-skilled jobs. Although the number of native people in low-skilled work fell by 1.1 million, the number in high-skilled positions rose by 2.2 million. That is generally a good thing.The committee\u2019s report judged that Britain\u2019s \u201cflexible labor market has mainly served us well.\u201d It also concluded that nationwide there was little impact from immigration on welfare claims, crime or use of education or health services.This complements other studies, which have shown among other things that the number of so-called welfare tourists is vanishingly small and that European Union immigrants pay more in taxes than the value of public goods and services they receive, unlike the native population.However, while the overall picture is positive, the new report highlights four specific problems.First, Britain is not equipping its less academically gifted young adults well to compete in the job market. That is partly because of government educational targets, which focus on pushing up average attainments at the expense of those at the bottom of the class, where basic math and literacy skills are low.It is also because many young Britons do not score well on \u201csoft skills\u201d such as flexibility, reliability, teamwork, a desire for continuous improvement and confidence. Employers often prefer foreign migrants.And the welfare system discourages Britons from taking temporary or seasonal work as well as from moving around the country.For all these reasons, there are too many young people who are \u201cNEETs\u201d \u2014 not in education, employment or training \u2014 and who are otherwise available for work (as opposed to looking after their own children, for example). Britain has around 600,000 of these, the vast majority of whom have low educational attainments.Second, Britain is not doing nearly enough to enforce its employment legislation. Since 2007, there have been only nine prosecutions for not paying the minimum wage. At that rate, an average employer would have to wait one million years to face prosecution.Immigrant workers, who are often brought into the country by \u201cgangmasters\u201d and sometimes do not know their rights, are the main victims of this enforcement failure. But low-skilled natives also suffer indirectly because employers are more willing to turn to immigrants on the grounds that they are easier to exploit.Third, Britain is not building enough new homes. The shortage is particularly acute at the bottom of the market. Although European Union immigrants do not use publicly funded housing nearly as intensively as natives, they still make it harder for locals to find such homes.Finally, migrants are not evenly spread around the country. They are concentrated in a few areas, especially London, and this can create pinch points in the provision of local services like education and health care.What is striking about this list of problems is that the government could go a long way toward solving these issues if it applied itself effectively. If Britain continues to fail to fix these problems, the backlash against immigration in parts of the country may continue to rise. And the government will be partly to blame if the people ultimately vote to quit the European Union.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Break With Peace", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMedia outlets opposed the move, hundreds of thousands of citizens protested outside the prime minister\u2019s official residence and a man set himself on fire in front of Shinjuku Station \u2014 all to no effect. Mr. Abe decided he could afford to go ahead. And it appears he was right: Postwar Japan\u2019s pacifist spirit is finally dying.In each case, the media focused on popular opposition to these actions, emphasizing dips in Mr. Abe\u2019s popularity. But the crucial point is that even with these dips, the prime minister has consistently drawn more support than opposition. If this had not been the case, he would almost certainly have decided not to rush ahead with his overbearing plan to alter the interpretation of Article 9.The Liberal Democratic Party, which Mr. Abe leads, has promoted a nationalist agenda ever since its establishment in 1955. For decades, L.D.P. cabinets were itching to revise the \u201cpeace constitution\u201d imposed by the United States following Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II.L.D.P. politicians also looked for ways to instill nationalist feelings in Japan\u2019s schoolchildren \u2014 and, to some degree, they were successful in using the government\u2019s system for approving textbooks to accomplish that goal. Until now, though, the party failed to make much headway on the constitutional issue.Popular distrust of the state ran so deep and an abhorrence of memories of wartime militarism was so strong that Article 9 became a third rail in Japanese politics. All these years, a widespread pacifism kept the L.D.P. in check.Seven decades after the 1945 defeat, anti-militarist sentiment in Japan is running out of steam. It is estimated that as many as three million Japanese, soldiers and civilians, died in World War II, or 4 percent of the population. Compare this with the national trauma of the 620,000 who died in the American Civil War \u2014 close to 2 percent of the population \u2014 and you get a sense of how deeply Japan\u2019s survivors must have been affected.This troublesome development becomes downright frightening when one considers relations among East Asian nations today. In 1980, the South Korean and Chinese economies were just starting to grow, while Japan had climbed to an entirely different level: Japan\u2019s gross domestic product was $1.1 trillion; South Korea\u2019s was $64.4 billion; and China\u2019s was $303.4 billion. Now, Japan\u2019s G.D.P. stands at $4.7 trillion; South Korea\u2019s is at $1.7 trillion; and China\u2019s has reached $13.4 trillion.Decades of rapid growth in Korea and China have transformed the three countries into more or less equal players in one of the most important regions in the world. While this is undoubtedly a good thing in many ways, it has also heightened tensions among them.One might note a parallel between the positions England, Germany and France occupied a century ago \u2014 a great power, a rising power and a fading power \u2014 and those that America, China and Japan occupy today. We see similar disputes over territory, the same rising tides of nationalism.With Communist ideals waning in China and pacifism, which we might think of as a sort of restraining ideology in its own right, losing effectiveness in Japan, there is a growing risk of a Sarajevo-type incident somewhere in the ocean between the two countries.After all, the new interpretation of the peace clause became possible only because so few Japanese people remember what the last war was like. It is hard to see how such forgetfulness will contribute to peace and security.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meeting Fails to Forestall Catalonia Secession Vote", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 The leader of Catalonia, the region that accounts for one-fifth of Spain\u2019s economy, told Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy during a meeting on Wednesday that he would go ahead with a vote on independence in November that the central government in Madrid has vowed to block.The meeting, in Madrid, was the first between Mr. Rajoy and Artur Mas, the head of the Catalan regional government, since Catalonia\u2019s governing coalition agreed in December on the timing and format of an independence vote.For that reason alone, the meeting was considered something of a breakthrough. But afterward, Mr. Mas told reporters that his secessionist plans remained on track and that there was \u201cno proposal on the part of the state to resolve this political conflict.\u201dMr. Mas said that the meeting had been characterized by \u201ca climate of open dialogue\u201d and that he had presented Mr. Rajoy with a set of economic proposals, including plans to increase infrastructure spending in Catalonia, which the prime minister agreed to study. But the outcome did little to decrease the sense of crisis looming before the country if no agreement can be reached to head off the vote.Mr. Mas started his secessionist push in 2012, after a huge pro-independence march in Barcelona, the Catalan capital. Another giant protest march is expected on Sept. 11, which Catalans celebrate as their national day. The date falls a week before an independence referendum in Scotland that is seen as a bellwether for Catalonia\u2019s prospects.Mr. Rajoy reiterated on Wednesday his opposition to any Catalan vote that violates Spain\u2019s Constitution. His veto of any such vote also received backing this week from Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the newly elected secretary general of the main Socialist opposition party.The legal problems of Mr. Pujol, 84, and his family threaten to discredit Catalonia\u2019s governing party, Convergence \u2014 which Mr. Pujol founded and ran for more than two decades, until 2003, and which Mr. Mas now leads.Mr. Mas has argued that the Pujol scandal is a personal issue that affects neither his government nor his secessionist push. But some politicians and Madrid newspapers have jumped on Mr. Pujol\u2019s confession to question why Catalans would want to secede when their own politicians are caught in the same kind of fraud scandal that has surfaced in Madrid and other regions since 2008 and the bursting of Spain\u2019s property bubble.Mr. Mas started his secessionist drive in September 2012 after Mr. Rajoy refused to grant Catalonia better financial treatment as part of a tax redistribution system that means Catalonia and other large and powerful regions help maintain poorer regions of Spain. Catalonia has 7.5 million citizens and contributes about 19 percent of Spain\u2019s gross domestic product through sectors including car production and tourism.\u201cTo seek independence from Spain is a simulacrum in order not to have to admit that what we want to escape from is from ourselves,\u201d wrote Salvador Sostres, a columnist at El Mundo.Another columnist, Xavier Vidal-Folch, suggested on Tuesday in El Pa\u00eds that the fiscal crimes of Mr. Pujol and his family should help debunk the separatist argument that Catalonia was a victim of an \u201ceconomic plunder\u201d by the central government.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Head of New York Tourism, 55 Million Visitors Isn\u2019t Enough", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFred Dixon is not replacing Neil Patrick Harris in \u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch\u201d on Broadway, but he still has one of the hardest acts to follow in New York City.The tourism boom, and the spending and tax revenue that come with it, was one of the biggest successes of the administration of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg took control of NYC & Company, installed George A. Fertitta as its chief executive, and laid out one audacious goal after another.In 2006, Mr. Bloomberg set a target of 50 million annual visitors by 2015, an increase of 6 million, or nearly 15 percent. That goal was reached four years ahead of schedule, so Mr. Bloomberg raised it to 55 million. He set another goal of having tourism\u2019s impact on the city\u2019s economy \u2014 a more complicated gauge \u2014 rise to $70 billion annually by 2015.Mr. Dixon is off to a promising start: He told the executive committee of NYC & Company last week that the latest projection is for 55.8 million visitors this year, an increase of 1.5 million from 2013.But he had some less cheerful news: Those visitors were not shopping, dining and entertaining themselves as prodigiously as hoped. Their spending this year is now expected to rise about 7 percent, to $41.3 billion.\u201cWhile they\u2019re still traveling, everyone\u2019s pocketbook is a little strained,\u201d Mr. Dixon said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re just spending a little bit less.\u201dNYC & Company estimates that each dollar a visitor spends translates into about $1.50 in economic activity, with that money changing hands repeatedly from merchant to employee to shopkeeper and so on. The agency\u2019s current estimate for tourism\u2019s economic impact this year is $61.1 billion, almost $9 billion shy of the goal for next year.To close that gap will require attracting even more overseas travelers, who tend to stay in hotels longer and shop more. Australia, Brazil and China have been sources of abundance, sending more tourists to the city in the last few years than Germany or Italy have. The 11.9 million international visitors expected this year would account for more than one-fifth of the total, according to NYC & Company.Native New Yorkers may enjoy complaining about out-of-towners clogging the sidewalks and hogging restaurant tables, but Mr. Dixon, a transplant himself, argues that the city will benefit from plenty more tourists. The leisure and hospitality sector of the economy, led by restaurants and bars, has added jobs at a faster pace than any other since the recession, statistics from the federal Department of Labor show.\u201cOur city would not be as robust and vibrant as it is if it were not for the infusion of cash\u201d from visitors, Mr. Dixon said. And that cash is spreading farther and farther from Times Square these days because, he said, tourists are \u201cexploring every corner of our city.\u201dThe ripple effect is clear from the list of hotels that have recently opened or will open soon in places like Williamsburg in Brooklyn, Long Island City in Queens and the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx. Before the end of the year, the number of hotel rooms in the city is expected to surpass 100,000 for the first time, up more than 30,000 since 2006.Despite all the construction, hotel operators have managed to keep filling their rooms at higher prices. The average rate paid for a hotel room in the city so far this year has been $266 a night, up more than 2 percent from the first five months of 2013, according to NYC & Company.That gain has come despite the proliferation of unregulated lodging services, such as Airbnb, that visitors use to find less expensive or less commercial accommodations. Mayor Bill de Blasio has voiced concerns about Airbnb, which the hotel industry fiercely opposes. But Mr. Dixon reserved judgment. If the service is deemed legal and can be properly regulated, he said, it could help fulfill the growing demand for \u201cexperiential travel.\u201d\u201cPeople want to live like a local and experience neighborhoods like a local,\u201d Mr. Dixon said. That is why NYC & Company has devoted substantial resources to promoting areas far from the bright lights, including Tompkinsville on Staten Island and the Gowanus section of Brooklyn.That effort is a favorite of Mr. de Blasio, who announced in mid-March that Mr. Dixon would fill the void left by Mr. Fertitta\u2019s departure last year. \u201cYou know when I see the tour buses go through Brooklyn, it gives me a thrill,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said then.Mr. Dixon, 44, has been with NYC & Company for nearly a decade, but he faced some competition for the top job. Marty Markowitz, the former Brooklyn borough president, was briefly considered, but he accepted a role as the agency\u2019s chief promoter of the boroughs outside of Manhattan.Among the 60 members of the board of NYC & Company, which receives much of its funding from hotels, restaurants and attractions, the support for Mr. Dixon to ascend was practically unanimous, said Emily K. Rafferty, the chairwoman of the board and president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\u201cHe\u2019s been boots-on-the-ground in terms of developing our presence in 18 countries,\u201d Ms. Rafferty said, referring to the network of offices the agency has set up around the globe. \u201cHe has this very unique personal style of engaging people and also managing the situation.\u201dOn a steamy July day, Mr. Dixon appeared utterly unruffled by the challenge of luring millions of additional visitors to the city. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Fred sweat,\u201d said Cristyne Nicholas, who hired Mr. Dixon when she ran NYC & Company. \u201cHe\u2019s a rock star.\u201dMr. Dixon has come a long way from his boyhood chore of cleaning the pool at the Gillette Motel in Gatlinburg, Tenn., which his family owns and his 65-year-old mother still manages. Last week, Mr. Dixon said he was preparing to dash down to Gatlinburg to spend the holiday weekend with his family, and he launched right into a rhapsody about the charms of the Smoky Mountains.\u201cHospitality is literally in my blood,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It is the first time the group has managed to cause restrictions on travel to Ben-Gurion airport; the last time foreign airlines suspended service to Israel was in 1991, when Iraq fired Scud missiles at the country.The three United States carriers with scheduled service to Israel \u2014 Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways \u2014 quickly canceled their flights, and were later joined by Air Canada and a number of Western European airlines, including Air France, Lufthansa and KLM. Turkish Airlines and the Russian carrier Aeroflot also suspended flights.British Airways said it \u201ccontinues to operate as normal\u201d for the moment, though a spokeswoman said the airline would monitor the situation closely. And El Al, the Israeli national carrier, kept flying as usual.The F.A.A. said it would provide updated instructions to the airlines \u201cas soon as conditions permit.\u201d The European Aviation and Safety Agency also warned airlines to avoid Israeli airspace.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday to seek his help in reversing the decision to suspend flights, Obama administration officials said. They did not comment on the substance of the call, which was first reported by the Israeli new media, nor did they say how Mr. Kerry responded to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s request.Ben-Gurion airport, the country\u2019s main international gateway, handled 14 million visitors last year and is critical to Israel\u2019s economy. It is about 40 miles from the Gaza border, closer than either of Israel\u2019s other international airports, at Eilat and Haifa. Those airports are much smaller than Ben-Gurion and handle mostly domestic and European flights; no American carrier serves either one.The decision to suspend service reflects a turn to greater caution by the airline industry, which appears to be much more sensitive to the risks of flying over conflict areas after the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner over eastern Ukraine last week.Delta suspended its service between Kennedy International Airport and Tel Aviv \u201cuntil further notice,\u201d and did not indicate when it might resume flights. US Airways said that it canceled Tuesday\u2019s flight from Philadelphia and that it was in contact with federal authorities. United canceled its two daily flights from Newark Liberty International Airport.The daily tally of rocket attacks, airstrikes and deaths in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.European airlines following suit included Air France, Brussels Airlines and KLM. Airlines of the Lufthansa Group, including the flagship, Austrian, Germanwings and Swiss, ordinarily operate seven to 10 flights daily from Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin, Zurich and Vienna, but the group canceled them all for Tuesday and Wednesday.Delta had a flight in the air on its way to Israel when the decision to restrict flights into Israeli airspace was made. Flight 468, a Boeing 747 with 273 passengers and 17 crew members aboard, was diverted to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris after the rocket fell in Yehud, a Tel Aviv suburb just north of the airport. According to Flightradar24.com, the plane was flying over Greece, about two hours from its destination, when it turned around and headed for France.An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said that Israel had had no advance notification by the airlines of their intention to cancel flights. The official insisted that it was safe to fly to Israel.\u201cIf they wanted to hand the terrorists a prize, they couldn\u2019t have chosen a better way,\u201d the official said, adding, \u201cIf it was safe so far, why would it not be safe now? Nothing has changed. The airport has been there since Day 1.\u201dThe police said that the rocket that struck Yehud on Tuesday badly damaged two houses. But the Israeli official noted that most of the rockets fired at the Tel Aviv area by militants had been intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome antimissile system.Ephraim Sneh, a retired general and deputy defense minister of Israel, was sharply critical of the decision to suspend flights. It was a dream of the militant Hamas leadership \u201cto disconnect Israel from the outer world,\u201d he told reporters on a conference call sponsored by the New York-based Israel Policy Forum.Michael R.

For that matter, how many people in the news media are following the positive developments?I suspect that the answer to the first question is \u201cNot many,\u201d while the answer to the second is \u201cPossibly even fewer,\u201d for reasons I\u2019ll get to later. And if I\u2019m right, it\u2019s a remarkable thing \u2014 an immense policy success is improving the lives of millions of Americans, but it\u2019s largely slipping under the radar.How is that possible? Think relentless negativity without accountability. The Affordable Care Act has faced nonstop attacks from partisans and right-wing media, with mainstream news also tending to harp on the act\u2019s troubles. Many of the attacks have involved predictions of disaster, none of which have come true. But absence of disaster doesn\u2019t make a compelling headline, and the people who falsely predicted doom just keep coming back with dire new warnings.I\u2019ve been seeing some claims on the right that the dramatic reduction in the number of uninsured was caused by economic recovery, not health reform (so now conservatives are praising the Obama economy?). But that\u2019s pretty lame, and also demonstrably wrong. For one thing, the decline is too sharp to be explained by what is at best a modest improvement in the employment picture. For another, that Urban Institute survey shows a striking difference between the experience in states that expanded Medicaid \u2014 which are also, in general, states that have done their best to make health care reform work \u2014 and those that refused to let the federal government cover their poor. Sure enough, the decline in uninsured residents has been three times as large in Medicaid-expansion states as in Medicaid-expansion rejecters. It\u2019s not the economy; it\u2019s the policy, stupid.Yes, there are losers from Obamacare. If you\u2019re young, healthy, and affluent enough that you don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy (and don\u2019t get insurance from your employer), your premium probably did rise. And if you\u2019re rich enough to pay the extra taxes that finance those subsidies, you have taken a financial hit. But it\u2019s telling that even reform\u2019s opponents aren\u2019t trying to highlight these stories. Instead, they keep looking for older, sicker, middle-class victims, and keep failing to find them.Oh, and according to Commonwealth, the overwhelming majority of the newly insured, including 74 percent of Republicans, are satisfied with their coverage.You might ask why, if health reform is going so well, it continues to poll badly. It\u2019s crucial, I\u2019d argue, to realize that Obamacare, by design, by and large doesn\u2019t affect Americans who already have good insurance. As a result, many peoples\u2019 views are shaped by the mainly negative coverage in the news media. Still, the latest tracking survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that a rising number of Americans are hearing about reform from family and friends, which means that they\u2019re starting to hear from the program\u2019s beneficiaries.And as I suggested earlier, people in the media \u2014 especially elite pundits \u2014 may be the last to hear the good news, simply because they\u2019re in a socioeconomic bracket in which people generally have good coverage.For the less fortunate, however, the Affordable Care Act has already made a big positive difference. The usual suspects will keep crying failure, but the truth is that health reform is \u2014 gasp! \u2014 working. Advertisement"}

Or are we forever smaller, stingier, dumber, less ambitious and more cynical? Have we lost control of our not-so-manifest destiny?Once we had Howard Baker, who went against self-interest for the common good. Now we have Ted Cruz. Once we had Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner whose fortitude in a Japanese P.O.W. camp was chronicled in Laura Hillenbrand\u2019s book \u201cUnbroken.\u201d Now we\u2019ve broken Iraq, liberating it to be a draconian state run on Sharia law, full of America-hating jihadists who were too brutal even for Al Qaeda. We\u2019re a little bit scared of our own shadow. And, sadly, we see ourselves as a people who can never understand one another. We\u2019ve given up on the notion that we can cohere, even though the founders forged America by holding together people with deep differences.A nation of immigrants watched over by the Statue of Liberty \u2014 with a government unable to pass immigration reform despite majority support \u2014 sees protesters take to the streets to keep Hispanic children trying to cross the border from being housed in their communities. Andrew Kohut, who has polled for Gallup and the Pew Research Center for over four decades, calls the mood \u201cchronic disillusionment.\u201d He said that in this century we have had only three brief moments when a majority of Americans said they were satisfied with the way things were going: the month W. took office, right after the 9/11 attacks and the month we invaded Iraq.The old verities seem quaint. If you work hard and play by the rules, you\u2019ll lose out to those guys who can wire computers to make bets on Wall Street faster than the next guy to become instant multimillionaires. Our quiet traditional virtues bow to our noisy visceral divisions, while churning technology is swiftly remolding the national character in ways that are still a blur. Boldness is often chased away by distraction, confusion, hesitation and fragmentation.Barack Obama vowed to make government cool again, but young people, put off by the dysfunction in our political, financial, military and social institutions, are eschewing government jobs. Idealism is swamped by special interests. The middle class is learning to do more with less. The president, sort of the opposite.\u201cThe world sees us as having gone from a president who did too much to a president who does too little,\u201d said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. David Axelrod, the president\u2019s Pygmalion, mused: \u201cReagan significantly changed the trajectory of the country for better and worse. But he restored a sense of clarity. Bush and Cheney were black and white, and after them, Americans wanted someone smart enough to get the nuances and deal with complexities. Now I think people are tired of complexity and they\u2019re hungering for clarity, a simpler time. But that\u2019s going to be hard to restore in the world today.\u201dYoung people are more optimistic than their rueful elders, especially those in the technology world.

The people we hold up as paragons did not always act nobly but would then later be portrayed as always acting nobly.

We\u2019re not destined for greatness. We have to earn that greatness. What George Washington did right was to realize how much of what he thought was right was wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feeble Inflation and Lending Persist in Euro Zone", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Dangerously low inflation in the euro zone persists while lending to the private sector continues to shrink, official data showed on Monday, problems that will confront European Central Bank officials as they meet this week to plot monetary policy.The \u201ccore\u201d rate, which strips out food and energy prices, rose 0.8 percent. The data are preliminary and subject to revision over the next month.The central bank also cut interest rates closer to zero and announced more low-cost loans to encourage banks to lend to the real economy.The need for such measures was underscored by a separate report by the central bank on Monday that showed lending to the private sector contracted again in May, shrinking 2 percent from a year earlier. Loan growth has been shrinking since March 2012.\u201cWhat the E.C.B. has done is to provide some help in a situation that needs other elements to fall into place,\u201d said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. Notably, he added, \u201cThey\u2019ve kept the euro from shooting higher.\u201dThe central bank would like to see the euro, which currently trades at around $1.36, decline, because that would help to push up the prices of imported goods that are priced in other currencies.Mr. Halpenny noted that with the central bank carrying out detailed analyses of banks\u2019 books and subjecting their portfolios to stress tests, a fully fledged recovery in lending would probably come about only if those tests helped restore confidence in the financial sector.An improvement in the American economy, which shrank at an unexpectedly large 2.9 percent pace in the first quarter, could also help the bank\u2019s cause, he said.But even in the best case, a full recovery in lending was not likely before next year, Mr. Halpenny added.Downward pressures on prices and lending are symptoms of the \u201cdeleveraging\u201d of indebted businesses and households, as well as weakness in demand. Government spending has been curtailed by austerity policies, and a weak job market has left consumers in limbo. The euro zone\u2019s jobless rate has stood near the current 11.7 percent for months.Deflation is poisonous for borrowers, because the cost of loan repayment rises in real terms. And European banks, which are trying to meet new capital standards, do not need any more soured loans on their balance sheets.A report last week based on a survey of businesses by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm, showed that the euro zone economy continued to expand slowly. Economists expect second-quarter growth of around 1.2 percent on an annualized basis, accelerating from the 0.7 percent rate in the first quarter of the year.While Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said that more measures were coming, analysts expect the bank\u2019s governing council, which meets on Thursday, to give its new measures time to be felt before taking further action.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.R.S. Commissioner John Koskinen, on Hot Seat, Has History of Bureaucratic Rescue Jobs", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was clear from the start that John Koskinen, the new commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, was in for a long night.Mr. Koskinen seemed fed up. \u201cI have no evidence whether she beat her dog, whether she beat children,\u201d he told them, his voice rising. \u201cI have no evidence of a whole series of things.\u201dFor nearly four hours at the June 23 hearing, Mr. Koskinen, a Yale-trained lawyer who says he gave up practicing law for Lent one year and never looked back, absorbed cascades of verbal salvos and tossed back several of his own. Hired to rehabilitate an agency that went awry targeting political groups, Mr. Koskinen\u2019s style \u2014 quick-witted to the point of being flip and sometimes impolitic \u2014 has left some wondering if he is the right person to restore the I.R.S.\u2019s battered credibility.He was two years into retirement in May 2013, filling his days with tennis, theater and grandchildren, when he received a series of urgent telephone calls. The White House and Treasury Department wanted to know if the then 73-year-old with a history as a Washington fixer would be willing to come back to work for one last rescue mission. The I.R.S. was in trouble, and they wanted him to run it. After a moment of contemplation, Mr. Koskinen, who as a child dreamed of being president, agreed. The decision sent him into the center of the worst firestorm in the agency\u2019s recent history and made him Washington\u2019s most prominent punching bag. \u201cI think I need counseling,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said, sitting at the head of the long wooden conference table in his beige and brown third-floor office at the I.R.S. headquarters. \u201cI\u2019m a recidivist, going from one kind of crisis to another.\u201dMr. Koskinen\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of America\u2019s biggest bureaucratic nightmares. Filling a top role in the Office of Management and Budget during the 1990s shutdown; steering the team tasked with averting the Y2K digital apocalypse at the turn of the century; leading Freddie Mac as the financial crisis unfolded. In one testy exchange last week with the House Oversight Committee chairman, Representative Darrell Issa, Mr. Koskinen said: \u201cI did not say I would provide you emails that disappeared. If you have a magical way to do that, I would be happy to hear about it.\u201dQuestioned later on Ms. Lerner\u2019s intentions, he replied: \u201cI cannot enter into Lois Lerner\u2019s mind. I have never met her.\u201dSuch responses have not won Mr. Koskinen sympathy from Republicans. Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from the Kentucky district where Mr. Koskinen grew up, said he has not been pleased with how the commissioner has handled himself at the hearings, pointing to what he called evasive answers.\u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s exercised poor judgment,\u201d said Mr. Massie, who once worked at the same oil refinery in Catlettsburg, Ky., where Mr. Koskinen spent summers digging foundations with a jackhammer. At the latest hearing, Mr. Koskinen sat alone at the witness table in a dark gray suit, powder blue shirt and patterned tie. He tapped his fingers gently on a leather folder and grinned serenely, responding to questions with flurries of facts and occasional dashes of sarcasm, all with a clipped monotone.Despite the hole the I.R.S. finds itself in at the moment, Mr. Koskinen seems to relish the experience in his own way, verbally jousting with skills honed on the debate team at Duke while bringing his management acumen to bear to improve communication within the agency.Mr. Koskinen has apologized to those whose applications for tax-exempt status were delayed because of a targeting of political labels. The agency came under fire after revelations last year that it brought additional scrutiny to applications submitted by groups with the terms \u201cTea Party\u201d or \u201cPatriots\u201d in their names. But Mr. Koskinen maintains that he has seen no other wrongdoing or cover-up.Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew continues to express confidence in Mr. Koskinen and said the commissioner was the administration\u2019s top choice for the job because of his experience turning around large organizations.\u201cThat was the set of skills very much needed at the I.R.S. at the point when he was nominated,\u201d Mr. Lew said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s almost the definition of a thankless job.\u201dMr. Koskinen\u2019s \u201cMr. Fix-It\u201d reputation and experience in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations made him a sensible choice for the role, but some have wondered about his lack of tax experience and have questioned his motivations.Competitive by nature, Mr. Koskinen learned to take hits and dish them out playing high school football in Ashland, Ky., during the 1950s. A linebacker and center, he kept spirits high despite losing seasons and did his best to counsel younger players, said Herbert Conley, at former teammate of Mr. Koskinen who went on to become a coach.\u201cHe led by example a lot; he was aggressive and he would get after people,\u201d Mr. Conley said. \u201cHe was a good tackler.\u201dA bit of a risk taker, Mr. Koskinen has said that chaos excites him and that once order is restored to an organization he often feels ready to move on. The strategy has reaped financial rewards over the years, as Mr. Koskinen has amassed a net worth that ranges between $7.1 million and $27.4 million, according to federal disclosure filings. The commissioner claims to be cautious with money, having never had run-ins with the I.R.S. before joining the agency and offering the fact that he has driven the same Toyota Celica to work every day for the last 16 years. Since taking the top job at the I.R.S., Mr. Koskinen has tried to put a friendlier face on the agency, introducing a taxpayer \u201cbill of rights,\u201d embarking on a listening tour of its national offices and expressing a willingness to work with people who have trouble paying their tax bills for financial reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, especially in a hostile environment,\u201d he said of his latest turnaround project.Meanwhile, the job is not expected to get any easier. An inspector general is scheduled to weigh in on the lost emails within weeks, and Mr. Issa made clear that his committee\u2019s inquiry was not adjourned but in recess.\u201cThis is probably one of the worst jobs in Washington,\u201d said Bruce McConnell, who worked with Mr. Koskinen at the Office of Management and Budget and the Y2K Council. \u201cPeople really don\u2019t like the I.R.S.\u201dSometimes on airplanes, Mr. Koskinen says, strangers shy away when he explains what he does for work. However, he still sees the I.R.S. as a crucial pillar of the economy, and he vows that despite what he calls intimidation tactics, he will serve the duration of his five-year term before retiring for good.\u201cI\u2019m going to have to go into the witness protection program,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cSo they can\u2019t find me.\u201d videoAdvertisement"}

He was 93.His wife, Margie King Barab, confirmed his death.Originally renowned as a cellist, Mr. Barab was a lifelong champion of contemporary music. He was a founding member of the Composers String Quartet, established in the mid-1960s with the violinists Matthew Raimondi and Anahid Ajemian and the violist Bernard Zaslav.The quartet, based for many years at Columbia University, was renowned for performing the work of 20th-century American composers like Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt and Ruth Crawford Seeger. As a composer, Mr. Barab was most famous for vocal works, including settings of texts by writers as diverse as Dryden, Yeats and Kurt Vonnegut. Recordings of his vocal music include the \u201cCosmos Cantata\u201d for singers and chamber orchestra, with text by Vonnegut.Mr. Barab was especially well known for composing operas. Those on serious subjects include the full-length works \u201cPhilip Marshall,\u201d a retelling of Dostoyevsky\u2019s \u201cThe Idiot,\u201d set in the Reconstruction-era American South, and \u201cA Piece of String,\u201d based on the Guy de Maupassant story about false accusation and a man\u2019s undoing.But he was still more widely known for lighter one-act works whose accessibility, tunefulness and economy of scale made them among the most frequently performed operas in the world. With humorous librettos by Mr. Barab and casts ranging in size from a single singer to a half-dozen, they are perennial favorites of college, semiprofessional and regional companies.Mr. Barab also wrote many operas for children, including adaptations of \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood,\u201d \u201cCinderella\u201d and \u201cSnow White\u201d and a Christmas opera, \u201cFather of the Child.\u201dSeymour Barab was born in Chicago on Jan. 9, 1921. At 13, he was playing the organ professionally in church; because his high school orchestra needed a cellist, he took up that instrument as a teenager. He went on to play in the Indianapolis and San Francisco Symphonies, the Cleveland Orchestra, the CBS Symphony Orchestra and the Galimir Quartet, among other ensembles.Mr. Barab, who was also an accomplished viola da gamba player, helped found the early-music ensemble that became New York Pro Musica.His other compositions include a wide array of instrumental works and \u201cSongs of Perfect Propriety,\u201d vocal settings of poems by Dorothy Parker. Mr. Barab\u2019s first marriage, to Shirley Perle, was annulled; his second, to Mary Ann Fretz Giusti, ended in divorce. Besides his wife, Margie, whom he married in 1972, his survivors include their daughter, Sarah Barab; a son, Jesse; and a daughter, Miriam Barab, from his second marriage; and two grandchildren.A longtime Manhattan resident, Mr. Barab formerly taught composition at Black Mountain College, the New England Conservatory of Music and Rutgers University.Though as a composer he was largely self-taught, Mr. Barab was such a skilled melodist that he could \u2014 and did \u2014 readily send up his musical forebears. Among his best-known works in the genre is \u201cParodies,\u201d a song cycle with texts culled from children\u2019s jump-rope rhymes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Americas on Health Care, and Danger of Further Division", "Date": "2014-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic Health\u2002For decades, the United States has had a fragmented health policy. States called the shots on major elements of how health care and health insurance were financed and regulated. The result: a hodgepodge of coverage and a wide variance in health.The Affordable Care Act was intended to help standardize important parts of that system, by imposing some common rules across the entire country and by providing federal financing to help residents in all states afford insurance coverage. But a series of court rulings on the law could make the differences among the states bigger than ever.The law was devised to pump federal dollars into poorer states, where lots of residents were uninsured. Many tended to be Republican-leaning. But the court rulings, if upheld, could leave only the richer, Democratic states with the federal dollars and broad insurance coverage. States that opted out of optional portions of the law could see little improvement in coverage and even economic damage.A new data set suggests that more than three million people would have gained health insurance across 24 states if the Supreme Court had ruled differently.\u201cIt will be essentially health reform for blue states,\u201d said John Holahan, a health policy fellow at the Urban Institute, a research group.Two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that another key provision of the law, one that expanded the Medicaid insurance program to all low-income Americans around the country, would be optional for states. Now that the expansion is underway, existing disparities in rates of insurance have widened among the states. About half the states decided not to expand Medicaid. Recent surveys show that those states that did expand it have significantly reduced their uninsured population. An Urban Institute survey found that the uninsurance rate among adults under 65 had declined by 6.1 percentage points in states that expanded, compared with only 1.7 percentage points in those that didn\u2019t.With the Medicaid decision and the D.C. Circuit decision, \"it really turns what was a national reform plan into a state-by-state reform,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research group. \u201cIt gives enormous power to states to decide whether major pieces of the Affordable Care Act go forward.\u201dThere are 24 states that have not expanded Medicaid and that don\u2019t have state insurance exchanges. Fifteen states with state exchanges have expanded Medicaid. The remaining states are participating in one Obamacare program, but not the other.Estimates from Kaiser suggest that most of the five million people who got subsidies in those states this year earned between twice and triple the poverty level, meaning they tend to be working families without access to employer coverage. These people probably could not easily afford the full price of an insurance policy. The Avalere analysis found that tax credits for the people who have already signed up for marketplace health plans paid for more than three-quarters of the cost of their premiums, on average.Of course, many more people are expected to sign up for health insurance in the years ahead if the law proceeds unmodified. Kaiser estimates a total of nearly 13 million people who are legally eligible for subsidized insurance in the 36 states.The elimination of subsidies would leave a group of states where residents \u201cwould remain without many of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Elizabeth Carpenter, a director at Avalere who wrote the report.The loss of the subsidies could set in motion a cascade of consequences for those states. Obamacare requires people to obtain insurance if they can afford it, and fewer people will be subject to that requirement if the subsidies disappear. Taking away both the encouragement of subsidies and the penalties for remaining uninsured will most likely mean that only the sickest and most motivated people will keep buying insurance in those marketplaces. That, in turn, could drive up the cost of insurance and prompt insurers to stop selling their products there, making access to insurance even more difficult.And the loss of insurance subsidies may also spell trouble for health care providers and the communities they serve. The Affordable Care Act paid for its generous subsidies in part by reducing payments it makes to hospitals. Hospitals took the deal because they calculated that all the new customers with insurance would help make up for the losses. The reduction in insured customers could mean big hits to those hospitals, many of which are major employers in their communities. The states in this category include some of the poorest in the nation.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.\nnytimes.com/upshot Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Germany Is Weltmeister", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A new nation won the World Cup. It was the first victory for a unified Germany, or a reunified Germany if you prefer. That country was more than a generation in the making. Germans do not believe in quick fixes.Formal reunification occurred on Oct. 3, 1990, a few months after the previous 1-0 German victory over Argentina in a World Cup final, an ugly affair in Rome. But it has taken a quarter-century, and untold billions, to knit the post-Cold War nation together. When I lived in Berlin between 1998 and 2001, it was not just the countless cranes hovering over the city that told of a work in progress. It was the different mind-sets of Ossi and Wessi, Easterners and Westerners eyeing each other with resentment.No matter, Germany had decided. It would pay the price to achieve reunification. It would work on the problem. It would move in the appointed direction, come what may.This fine World Cup winning team was also the fruit of long-term planning. Over the past dozen years, the Deutscher Fussball-Bund (DFB), or German Football Association, has invested a fortune in new facilities, identifying youthful talent, nurturing that talent and ushering it to the national level. Two young players who emerged from that system, Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle of Chelsea and Mario G\u00f6tze of Bayern Munich, combined to conjure the beautiful goal that clinched victory.It had been preceded by the 7-1 demolition of the hosts, Brazil, in the semi-final. Seldom has a soccer match so resembled an execution. It was not only Germans who felt the need to look away. Domination is not the modern German way. Brazilian agony was too explicit not to cringe.BBC commentators could not resist the clich\u00e9s. Germany was \u201cclinical.\u201d It was \u201cefficient.\u201d People tweeted, \u201cDon\u2019t mention the score.\u201d With Germany there is always something unmentionable that rhymes with war. It is not easy to be German. But in that difficulty, as this team suggested, there lie strengths. Everything about this team, from its talent to its ethics, was admirable. The right team does not always win. In this case it did.Germany, I said, does not believe in quick fixes. It is worth repeating because it is an idea that sets the country apart in an age where a quick killing, tomorrow\u2019s share price, instant gratification and short-termism are the norm. Germans on the whole think what the rest of the world builds is flimsy. Anyone who has felt the weight of a German window, or the satisfying hermetic clunk of one closing, knows they have a point. The German time frame is longer.Why Germany differs in this may be debated. Having plumbed the depths of destruction and evil, having understood the depravity into which a \u201ccivilized\u201d country may descend, Germany had to rebuild from the \u201cStunde Null,\u201d or \u201cZero Hour,\u201d of 1945. It had to hoist itself up step by step; and it had to build into its reconstituted self the guarantees that ensured no relapse was possible. This took planning. It took persistence. It involved prudence. Even before all this the first German unity of 1871 came only after centuries of strife at the European crossroads. Geborgenheit is an untranslatable German word but no less important for that. It means roughly warmth, home, trust and security, everything that is so precious in part because it may go up in smoke.Perhaps German success is the result of the immensity of past German failure. I think that has something to do with it, even a lot. Whatever its roots, German success is important and instructive.If you talk to business leaders of the German Mittelstand, the small and medium-sized companies at the heart of the country\u2019s economy, you are transported to another world. You sit in stark boardrooms, so devoid of indulgence they resemble classrooms, with unassuming people leading billion-dollar companies, and they speak of loyalty, 10-year plans, prudence and quality. If one word induces a look of horror, it is debt. The notion of making money with money, of financial engineering rather than engineering itself, is alien.Joachim L\u00f6w, the German coach, spoke before the final of the careful building of his youthful side: \u201cWe can play on top of the world for a good few years yet, with some young players coming in to reinforce the team.\u201d Inevitably, the idea of Germany \u201con top of the world\u201d for a long time conjured up images the phrase would not evoke for another country. Even a victory dance by members of the German team turned into a national debate because it was seen by some as unseemly mocking of the gaucho Argentine. The president of the DFB apologized.Germany is now soccer\u2019s \u201cWeltmeister,\u201d a composite word composed of \u201cworld\u201d and \u201cmaster.\u201d It deserves the honor. Its society has much to teach others. But restraint will be its watchword. David Brooks is off today.My column on Tuesday incorrectly described\nIsrael Hayom.

The overall gain in June missed economists\u2019 forecasts of a 0.6 percent increase.But core retail sales, which exclude sales of automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, increased 0.6 percent last month after rising an upwardly revised 0.2 percent in May. Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported as being flat in May. June\u2019s gains and May\u2019s upward revision to core retail sales suggested an increase in consumer spending in the second quarter after growing at its slowest pace in more than four years in the first quarter because of weak health care consumption.Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting company, raised its second-quarter G.D.P. growth forecast by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 3 percent annual pace.

The I.M.F. now expects just 1.7 percent growth in the United States, which would be the weakest level since the recession officially ended five years ago. That is down from its April prediction of 2.8 percent, mostly because of a sharp weather-related contraction in the first quarter.Olivier Blanchard, the I.M.F.\u2019s chief economist, said the American economy\u2019s recent weakness was in \u201cthe past, to a large extent.\u201d\u201cLooking forward, growth in the U.S. is reasonably strong,\u201d he added.The I.M.F. also slashed its outlook for Russia\u2019s growth to just 0.2 percent this year and 1 percent in 2015. Russia\u2019s conflict with Ukraine has caused a sharp drop in foreign investment.The weaker growth estimates illustrate the need for central banks in advanced economies in the United States and Europe to keep interest rates low, the report said. The Federal Reserve has pegged the short-term rate it controls at nearly zero for more than five years. But most economists expect the Fed to start slowly raising that rate in mid-2015.The European Central Bank has cut its benchmark rate to 0.15 percent, a record low. It has put a negative rate on the deposits it holds for commercial banks to try to get them to lend more.In China, consumer spending has declined as the government has sought to reduce lending, the I.M.F. said.

{"Headline": "With Eye on Election, British Premier Shuffles Cabinet", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain shook up his government on Tuesday in an effort to present a fresher, less abrasive and more diverse face to voters with the next general election just 10 months away.Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party is heading into the election campaign facing an array of challenges. Opinion polls suggest that the election will be close and unpredictable. Apparently with that in mind, Mr. Cameron revamped his cabinet more thoroughly than expected on Tuesday, dismissing or moving several prominent men and promoting a number of women. Mr. Cameron shifted one of his most divisive colleagues \u2014 the education secretary, Michael Gove \u2014 to a less prominent role. A politician who sometimes seemed to revel in being a pain to teachers\u2019 unions will move to a post in the House of Commons with responsibility for the discipline of Conservative lawmakers, part of what analysts said was a concerted effort to soften the party\u2019s image.By contrast, Mr. Cameron sent a tougher message on relations with the European Union by appointing Philip Hammond as foreign secretary. Mr. Hammond has said he would vote to leave the bloc if Britain could not negotiate better membership terms.The British economy has rebounded recently after years of recession and austerity, but opinion polls suggest that many voters still feel worse off than before the financial crisis. Most polls now show the Conservatives running only slightly behind the opposition Labour Party, giving Mr. Cameron reason to hope that he can still win another term. He is governing now in a coalition with the centrist Liberal Democrats.Mr. Cameron kept George Osborne as chancellor of the Exchequer, with the central task of managing the economy, but elsewhere in his cabinet he freshened the faces \u2014 if not the policies \u2014 of a government that Labour says is led by millionaires out of touch with ordinary Britons.Mr. Cameron began trying to redress that perception this year when he filled a senior ministerial vacancy by appointing Sajid Javid, the son of an immigrant bus driver. On Tuesday, he appeared to stay on that path.\u201cIn order to demonstrate a more friendly and modern Conservative face, Cameron has brought more women, regional accents and ethnic minorities into the cabinet, giving the impression the Conservative front-bench is more in touch with ordinary voters, and not the elites that are the Conservatives\u2019 oft-assumed natural constituency,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman wrote in an analysis for Eurasia Group, a consulting firm.Nicky Morgan, a Treasury minister, will be promoted to education secretary to replace Mr. Gove, who is becoming the Conservative party\u2019s chief whip, responsible for keeping its ranks together in the House of Commons.Charles Lewington, a former director of communications for the Conservative Party, wrote in a blog commentary that Mr. Gove\u2019s move was \u201ca triumph for the pollsters,\u201d who argued that his combative style was \u201cdeterring women voters,\u201d who appear in polls to be drifting to Labour.On European policy, Mr. Cameron has felt growing pressure from the right, especially from the United Kingdom Independence Party, which wants Britain to quit the European Union. Mr. Cameron has steadily hardened his position in response, promising last year that if he were re-elected he would renegotiate Britain\u2019s membership in the union and then hold a referendum on it in 2017.Mr. Lewington wrote that in Mr. Hammond, Britain would have a foreign secretary \u201cwho is prepared to say we should quit the European Union if we don\u2019t get the concessions we want.\u201d Mr. Hammond succeeds William Hague, a former party leader who is thought to have slightly softened his position on Europe. Mr. Hague will retain a lower-profile cabinet post until next year and then retire.Another veteran, Kenneth Clarke, a minister without portfolio, is departing in the shake-up. His positive views on the European Union may have prevented him from leading the party.Britain\u2019s nominee for a seat on the European Commission, the union\u2019s executive body, is Jonathan Hill, a low-profile politician who has been the leader of the House of Lords. His appointment was something of a surprise; when a Conservative website asked him in June about the possibility, he replied with a brief burst of French: \u201cNon, non, non.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Multibillion-Dollar Question for Airbus and Its A330", "Date": "2014-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOULOUSE, France \u2014 Inside a 185-acre assembly hall in this quiet corner of southwestern France, a dozen of Airbus\u2019s best-selling wide-body jets stand in various stages of construction.Over the last two decades, nearly 1,100 finished A330s have emerged from this building, their tails bearing the logos of more than 100 airlines from 40 countries. But with the advent of a new generation of lightweight, carbon-fiber wide-bodies like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus\u2019s own A350-XWB, which is expected later this year, the A330 is starting to show its age.So Airbus is poised to move forward with a major, multibillion-dollar plan to design and execute an upgrade for the A330, people close to the deliberations said on Friday. An announcement is possible as early as Monday, the first day of the Farnborough International Airshow, near London.In recent weeks, Airbus has presented several airline customers with details of a new version of the plane, which would be fitted with new engines and more aerodynamic wings that would reduce the A330\u2019s fuel consumption by as much as 15 percent. The people who described those plans spoke on the condition of anonymity because the board of the Airbus Group, the plane maker\u2019s parent company, had not yet formally approved the decision.The management of Airbus has spent at least six months deliberating whether to revamp the A330 or simply let the plane glide into retirement while the company spends its time and money producing and marketing newer aircraft.Analysts and investors have argued that extending the life of the A330 would help maintain a valuable source of cash for Airbus at a time when less mature aircraft \u2014 like the twin-deck A380, or the A350 \u2014 are still years away from recouping their development costs.While the A330 continues to generate around 40 percent of Airbus\u2019s civilian aircraft profits, new orders for the plane have slowed significantly in recent years. Airbus\u2019s current backlog of unfilled orders for the A330 amounts to just 250 planes. While that is equivalent to about two years of production at current rates, it is only a small fraction of the current industry-average backlog of more than eight years.A decision to upgrade the A330 would follow a similar move by Airbus four years ago to revamp its short-range, single-aisle workhorse, the A320, which was followed by Boeing a year later with an upgrade of its competing 737. The approach has proved successful for both companies, sustaining demand for both planes beyond the middle of the next decade.But some analysts warn that the economic case for an A330 revamp is less compelling than it is for those smaller jets, and risks tying up research and development capabilities that could be more profitably deployed elsewhere.\u201cIt\u2019s not a no-brainer,\u201d said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, a London brokerage firm. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of risk and resource implications.\u201dAfter several bumper years of new commercial aircraft orders, Airbus and Boeing are heading into the Farnborough show \u2014 the world\u2019s largest aerospace bazaar \u2014 with order books already overstuffed with demand for their latest single-aisle jets, as well as new fuel-sipping wide-bodies that promise operating-cost savings of up to 15 percent over older models.But with the wait times to receive new planes now stretching to more than six years, airlines have been slower to reach for their checkbooks. Despite an improving global economy and a stronger earnings outlook \u2014 airlines worldwide expect combined profits of $18 billion this year, up from nearly $11 billion last year \u2014 the number of orders to be announced at Farnborough is expected to be relatively subdued.Neither Boeing nor Airbus has any all-new aircraft models on the drawing board. That is all the more reason an update of the aging A330 could draw widespread interest.The closest parallel might be Boeing\u2019s decision late last year to offer an updated version of its popular 777, which entered service in 1995. The renovated versions will seat up to 400 passengers, compared with 300 to 350 now, and will be equipped with General Electric engines that promise to cut fuel consumption by 12 percent.Boeing has won orders for more than 250 of the planes, known as the 777X, which are expected to enter service beginning in 2020.Some say Airbus could lure customers for as many as 1,000 revamped wide-body planes, enough to keep the A330\u2019s assembly line in Toulouse humming until the end of the next decade. A number of top customers \u2014 including Delta Air Lines and the Malaysian-based low-cost carrier AirAsia X, as well as major jet-leasing companies like the Los Angeles-based Air Lease Corporation \u2014 have expressed keen interest in an upgraded A330, particularly if the planes can be delivered sooner than rival models.The new version of the A330, which would be expected to enter service by 2020, would include up to 10 additional seats and be fitted with new engines built by Rolls-Royce of Britain, the people with knowledge of the planning said. The engines would be similar in design to one that the company developed for the Boeing 787, a person with knowledge of the plans said.Representatives of Airbus and Rolls-Royce declined to comment on Friday.\u201cI think the A330 definitely has a place in this market, and careful, tailored upgrades will probably stretch the relevance of the product at least another 10 years,\u201d said Michel Merluzeau, a managing partner of G2 Solutions, an aerospace consultancy in Kirkland, Wash.Analysts say a revamped A330 would probably not be able to compete with the fuel economy of Boeing\u2019s three-year-old 787 Dreamliner or with the updated 777, which in addition to new engines will have lighter wings made of carbon fiber instead of aluminum.Other design adjustments to the A330, like improving its wings, could be made to further enhance its performance, but analysts still say Airbus would be obliged to offer the plane at a significant discount to its newer peers.A more attractive price tag, combined with earlier availability \u2014 analysts say a revamped A330 could be ready for service in four years \u2014 would probably attract a wide range of customers.That might entice emerging markets like China and India, for which Boeing\u2019s 787 and 777, and even Airbus\u2019s A350 have until now remained out of reach \u2014 all of those jets have list prices of $250 million or more. Current versions of the A330 list for $215 million to $240 million.\"There is potential in the passenger and cargo markets, and even with some military markets,\u201d Mr. Merluzeau said. \u201cI think sufficient demand could be accomplished at attractive price points while addressing the concerns of airlines.\"Still, a revamped A330 would burn around 15 percent more fuel than its newer competitors, meaning that it could be a tough sell, even at a discount.\"Will you end up selling any more than you would have if you stuck with the old version and cut the price?\u201d asked Mr. Cunningham, the London analyst. He noted that the current low interest-rate environment was already reducing customers\u2019 sensitivity to list price, while the recent instability in the Middle East was refocusing attention on the risk of rising oil prices.Damien Lasou, a managing director and aerospace analyst at the Paris office of the management consulting firm Accenture, added that, unlike the choices in the single-aisle market, which is almost evenly split between Boeing\u2019s 737 and Airbus A320, airlines face a much wider menu of long-range wide-body options to choose from. Therefore, there is some risk that an incremental A330 upgrade could become a niche aircraft with a limited potential customer base.\u201cThere is much more fragmentation\u201d of the wide-body jet market, Mr. Lasou said. \u201cEach aircraft type is covering a smaller range of routes. The market is becoming much more specialized.\u201dBut judging from the preponderance of freshly painted logos from Asian and Middle Eastern carriers on the planes being built in Toulouse, the A330\u2019s appeal in the world\u2019s fastest-growing aviation markets remains strong. If a revamped version manages to extend that demand still further, the thrum inside these factory walls might be heard for years to come.Advertisement"}

But he said the demand for high-yield investments had not been accompanied by a surge in debt of the kind that preceded the financial crisis.The central bank is attentive to the risk of bubbles, he said. If any arose, he said, the solution would be to tighten regulation of banks rather than raise official interest rates.\u201cWe don\u2019t see a bubble yet,\u201d Mr. Draghi said, adding, \u201cI think the word is \u2018frothy\u2019 market conditions.\u201dMr. Draghi\u2019s comments came as concern rises that investors around the world have been paying too much for bonds and other securities, creating the conditions for a market crash. In Europe, market interest rates for some government bonds have plunged. Greek 10-year bonds that once sold with an interest rate, or yield, of 40 percent have been selling recently with yields close to 6 percent.Mr. Draghi\u2019s appearance at Parliament was his first since a new session began this month with members elected in May, when parties hostile to the European Union and the euro currency made significant gains. Among his questioners was Bernd Lucke, a new member of Parliament who is chairman of the Alternative for Germany party, which wants to scrap the euro.As expected, Mr. Lucke\u2019s questions reflected his euro-skeptic views. He suggested, for example, that it would be a mistake to admit Lithuania to the eurozone on Jan. 1, as planned. \u201cI want to know what the economic advantages of the euro are supposed to be,\u201d Mr. Lucke said.Mr. Draghi replied that tying Lithuania closer to Europe would help preserve the country\u2019s independence. Sometimes, Mr. Draghi said, \u201cshared sovereignty is the only way to retain sovereignty.\u201d\u201cThis is what the Lithuanians have understood very well,\u201d he said.Mr. Lucke also asked Mr. Draghi to defend record-low European Central Bank interest rates, which he said were creating severe problems for German pension funds.Mr. Draghi replied that \u201cwe look at those concerns very carefully,\u201d but that low market interest rates in Germany were not the fault of central bank policy. In June, the bank cut its main policy rate to 0.15 percent, the lowest ever.The bank is ready to undertake large asset purchases to stimulate the eurozone economy if needed, Mr. Draghi said, repeating earlier expressions of resolve. Official data released on Monday showed that eurozone industrial production fell in May, raising concern that a weak recovery on the Continent was already losing steam.So-called quantitative easing, Mr. Draghi said, \u201cfalls squarely in our mandate.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about comments by Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, regarding the likelihood of asset bubbles in the eurozone, misstated, in some editions, where he spoke. He addressed members of the European Parliament at a meeting in Strasbourg, France, not in Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Great Jobs Numbers, but Hold the Fireworks", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Jobs ReportThere can be no question that the United States employment data for June, released on a rare \u201cJobs Thursday\u201d thanks to the Independence Day holiday, is good news.The 288,000 jobs that employers added to their payrolls last month was far better than the 215,000 economists had projected. Over the past year employers have added 2.495 million jobs, the most in eight years. The unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent, its lowest level since September 2008, the month Lehman Brothers imploded and the economic catastrophe of the global financial crisis began in earnest.This isn\u2019t one of those months when some good headline data is undermined by the fine print. The fine print in June was pretty good, too. The unemployment rate fell because 325,000 fewer people were unemployed and 407,000 more people had jobs \u2014 not because people just dropped out of the labor market. Revisions to April and May numbers were positive. Perhaps the best news was on worker pay: The index of weekly payrolls for private-sector workers rose a nice 0.4 percent, reflecting both a longer workweek and higher hourly pay.So the reasons I\u2019m saving the fireworks for the July 4 holiday, rather than this jobs report, is not because there is some obvious soft underbelly. It\u2019s because we\u2019ve kind of seen this before.Do you remember January 2012? Those ancient days when \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d was on television and Adele\u2019s \u201cSomeone Like You\u201d was on the radio? Yes, it was a distant time. It was also a month in which employers added even more jobs than June, with 360,000 reported new jobs.For the last three months, job growth has now hit a quite good average of 272,000 net new jobs a month. But that isn\u2019t the best of the recovery either; back at the start of 2012, job creation averaged 276,000 positions a month.And while the year-over-year job creation level of 2.495 million is indeed the highest of the recovery, it only barely exceeds the 2.462 million of March 2012 or the 2.461 million of November 2013.There has been a lot of rumbling that the economy is starting to burst out of its shell, with robust, above-trend growth really arriving for the first time in five years of recovery. And that may be true! But if this halting, sluggish recovery has taught us anything, it is to not let our assessments of the economy be driven by hope, but rather by sustained and credible improvement in a wide range of economic data.For example, if you wanted a reason to be skeptical of the June jobs numbers, you could point out that the bad winter weather forced many schools to remain open later into June than usual, resulting in more teachers and administrators being on payrolls in the middle of last month than the seasonal adjustment procedures would account for. Private educational services jobs rose by 5,000, while local and state government jobs added a combined 20,000. There is a good chance those jobs will \u201cdisappear\u201d in the July numbers, even if it remains just a continued after-effect of the bad winter.That doesn\u2019t completely undermine the story of more robust growth on the way. It just confirms the point that anybody hoping for a better economy should not read the latest numbers as conclusive evidence that everything is fixed. Instead, they can be seen as one more promising but inconclusive hint that the long-awaited jobs boom could indeed be around the corner.Use a variation of the old saw, trust, but verify. Trust, but be patient.Advertisement"}

Mr. Obama said the Central American presidents are \u201cexcellent partners,\u201d and thanked them for their efforts to discourage children from making the dangerous journey to the United States. But he also urged them to do more to combat the smugglers who, for a price, are transporting the children.But in comments to reporters after the meeting with Mr. Obama, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez of Honduras said that the United States must accept that demand for illegal drugs in America is in part responsible for the violence that is causing the migrants to flee their homes in Central America. He called on the United States to help his country address what he called the root of the issue.The number of children crossing the U.S. border alone has doubled since last year. Answers to key questions on the crisis.\u201cWashington must understand that if you have a Central America with violence because of the drug traffic crime, a Central America without opportunities, without growth in the economy, it is going to always be a problem for the United States,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said, as translated from Spanish by one of his aides.In a joint statement by the four presidents issued by the White House after the meeting, the leaders pledged to \u201caddress the underlying causes of migration by reducing criminal activity and promoting greater social and economic opportunity.\u201d But the White House did not make any announcements about further economic aid for Central America beyond what they have requested from Congress in recent weeks.The meeting came as the administration continues to press Congress for more resources and authority to confront the flood of migrants, especially children, who have crossed into the Rio Grande Valley in Texas in recent months. More than 57,000 unaccompanied children and thousands more adults with children have crossed the border since October.Before their meeting with Mr. Obama, the presidents of Guatemala and Honduras said they were working to crack down on drug trafficking and violence in their own countries but they also called on the United States to share in the responsibility for the crisis.Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez of Honduras said on Thursday that the surge in migration was due in part to \u201cthe ambiguity that has been the hallmark of the debate of the reform of the immigration process in this country.\u201dAdministration officials reject the idea that Mr. Obama\u2019s policies \u2014 including stopping deportations for young immigrants who were brought to the United States as children \u2014 are responsible for creating any confusion about who will be allowed to stay in the country.Mr. Obama used the meeting with the presidents to ratchet up pressure on United States lawmakers to act soon on his request for emergency funding.\u201cIt is my hope that Speaker Boehner and House Republicans will not leave town for the month of August for their vacations without doing something to help solve this problem,\u201d Mr. Obama said after the meeting ended on Friday.The debate over how to handle the migrant children has all but stalled on Capitol Hill, where Senate Democrats and House Republicans this week unveiled competing proposals for Mr. Obama\u2019s request for emergency funds \u2014 each far less than the $3.7 billion the president initially requested.A major issue dividing lawmakers is a 2008 law intended to combat human trafficking, but which has made it more difficult to quickly return Central American children to their home countries. Republicans refuse to support any legislation that does not change the law in order to expedite the deportation of the young migrants, and Democrats are reluctant to vote for any legislation that changes the law. Democrats say they fear it could hurt children who are fleeing dangerous situations in their home countries.House Republicans on Friday left their special meeting on the border crisis more unified than many in the conference had expected, armed with the beginnings of a proposal that would allocate less than $1 billion to the southern border.In his comments on Friday after leaving the West Wing, Mr. Hernandez said that he told Mr. Obama that he could help convince lawmakers in the United States to support his request by helping them to see the situation firsthand.\u201cMaybe he took it as a joke, but I was being serious that the president should lend Air Force One to the members of Congress so they can go back to Honduras so they can see what is happening,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said. \u201cHe thought I was joking, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Future of the Economy Depends on It.", "Date": "2014-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning Profits Into ProductivityDear C.E.O.s of America:Love, Everybody ElseIf firms increased their spending enough to close that gap, it would mean an extra $220 billion in annual economic activity and perhaps a couple of million more jobs. But there may be even more important and lasting consequences for this lack of spending by businesses.Capital spending improves worker productivity. And worker productivity improves living standards. Less capital spending by businesses means less investment in the kinds of equipment, software and intellectual property that will make the economy more competitive over the long haul.A lot of guesswork goes into measuring, let alone understanding, changes in productivity, but it\u2019s reasonable to see underinvestment by American businesses as a prime suspect in the underperformance.The question now is whether that is poised to change. The corporate sector would seem to be primed for increasing their level of investment, with profits high, cash hoards strong and capital available on the cheap.There is most likely some interplay between the weak capital spending numbers and the weak job market of the last few years; there is less incentive to spend money on productivity-enhancing equipment when labor is cheap. As the job market tightens and workers have better leverage to demand wages, spending money on new equipment becomes more attractive. To return to our ditch-digging business, you may be more inclined to spend thousands of dollars on that earth mover when the going rate for a laborer is $12 an hour as opposed to $10.In that sense, an improving job market could increase capital spending, which in turn would create a virtuous cycle of more economic activity, more jobs and higher productivity growth.Another reason for optimism on capital spending, made by Scott Anderson, the chief economist of Bank of the West, is that the nation\u2019s factories are starting to run closer and closer to their full capacity, which implies that they will need to spend for more equipment to meet higher demand.The manufacturing sector is now operating at 77.8 percent of its capacity, according to Federal Reserve data, well above the 76 percent average during the last expansion and not far from the 79.1 percent peak during the mid-2000s.\u201cAs manufacturing approaches full capacity, wage pressures will build and many businesses will be forced to redirect their profits away from stock buybacks and toward actual physical investment, which will help bolster U.S. G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Anderson writes in a research note.Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s right. But it\u2019s worth adding that right now, the idea of a wave of business spending is more speculation than reality. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a good forward-looking measure of companies\u2019 intentions on the equipment front, has bounced around between $70 billion and $71 billion a month for the last three months. It has not exhibited a clear upward trend.As with so much about this often-frustrating recovery, it\u2019s not enough to see evidence for why things should improve in the future; we need to see it to believe it.The Upshot provides news, analysis\nand graphics about politics,\npolicy and everyday life.Advertisement"}

Though this seems completely logical \u2014 the biggest companies do the biggest deals, after all \u2014 this has also made them a target of the right, which views the relationship between the bank and American multinationals as the paradigmatic example of \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201dSecond, most of the arguments made against the Ex-Im Bank revolve around its help to the big companies, not the small ones. For instance, it is argued that big companies have their own means of helping customers finance deals. That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s the customers, not the companies, that are pushing for export credit guarantees. A Boeing source told me that it is hearing from customers and potential customers about the fate of the Ex-Im Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d my source said, especially in places like Africa, where conventional financing for aircraft is hard to come by.\u201cNobody is saying these companies are going to die if they can\u2019t use the Ex-Im Bank,\u201d said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a member of the Ex-Im Bank\u2019s advisory board. \u201cThe issue is their ability to meet their competition.\u201d Hufbauer ticked off some of the competitors: Siemens of Germany is a huge company that competes with G.E.; Komatsu of Japan competes with Caterpillar; and, of course, Airbus competes with Boeing. Each of them gets assistance from their own export credit agency, none of which will go away if the U.S. decides not to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.One thing the House Republicans have sought is a commitment from the Treasury Department to lobby for the elimination of export credit agencies around the world. But this is an ideological pipe dream. Other countries have no interest in walking away from export assistance; indeed, countries like China and Japan are far more wedded to this kind of assistance than the U.S. is.In its editorial on Monday, The Journal mocked the phrase \u201cunilateral disarmament\u201d in regards to the Export-Import Bank.

{"Headline": "Fed, Confident in Economy, Details End of Bond-Buying Program", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it planned to stop adding to its bond holdings in October, in a sign of its confidence that the economy is gaining strength even as the central bank gradually withdraws its support.The decision, described in an account of the Fed\u2019s most recent policy-making meeting in June, signals the end of one of the central bank\u2019s most aggressive efforts to stimulate the economy. The Fed, which started reducing its monthly purchases in January, said it planned to add a final $100 billion to its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities over the next four months, for a total of $1.5 trillion.But the account underscored that many Fed officials remained guarded in their optimism about the economy. It also suggested that they had not yet decided when to take an even more important step in their retreat: raising short-term interest rates for the first time since December 2008.Investors generally expect the Fed to start raising interest rates next summer. The Fed said the decision to end bond purchases in October, rather than continuing purchases at a nominal level until the end of the year, should not be interpreted as evidence that rate increases were likely to begin sooner. \u201cMost participants viewed this as a technical issue with no substantive macroeconomic consequences and no consequences for the eventual decision about the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate,\u201d the minutes said, referring to the benchmark interest rate that the Fed uses to influence borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.Fed officials disagree about the pace of retreat in large part because they disagree about how much more monetary policy can accomplish. Five years past the end of the Great Recession, the share of adults with jobs has barely recovered, inflation remains below the level the Fed regards as healthy, and economic output remains weak. Officials are increasingly convinced that some of this damage is permanent \u2014 or at least, that it cannot be fixed by holding down borrowing costs \u2014 but they differ on the depth of the damage.At the June meeting of Federal Open Market Committee, they debated why the housing market weakened over the last year, whether sidelined workers would return to the labor market in large numbers, and when inflation would start to rise. Since last year, however, they have been in firm agreement that the time has come to stop buying bonds. The purchases are intended to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, and to encourage risk-taking by investors. But the impact of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases, and similar efforts undertaken by central banks in Britain and Japan, remains highly contentious. Officials and academics disagree about how much, if at all, the purchases have reduced the cost of mortgages and other kinds of consumer and business loans. They also disagree about the consequences. Warnings about inflation proved to be mistaken, but there is still concern the purchases have destabilized financial markets.Officials in recent months have expressed particular concern that many investors have grown overly complacent about the Fed\u2019s plans, mistaking its predictions about the likely timing of its retreat for bankable certainties. While that sense of certainty is helping to hold down borrowing costs, officials are concerned that it will come at a price if those expectations are disappointed. As investors have discounted the risk of losses, they have driven up asset prices in markets across the globe, raising concerns about potential bubbles.\u201cLow implied volatility in equity, currency and fixed-income markets, as well as signs of increased risk-taking, were viewed as an indication that market participants were not factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy,\u201d the account said in describing the Fed\u2019s misgivings.Such concern is a reason that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, has sought to emphasize that the central bank\u2019s next steps depend on economic conditions. Investors, so far, remain largely unshaken. \u201cThis concern about low volatility is somewhat ironic given that it\u2019s their policies which are responsible,\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.While minutes did not clarify when the Fed planned to start raising interest rates, it did provide some new details about the mechanics. Before the crisis, the Fed set policy by moving the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks pay to borrow money from each other to maintain required levels of reserves in their accounts at the central bank. But the Fed, in buying bonds from banks as part of its recent stimulus efforts, has flooded those banks with excess reserves, all but eliminating demand for interbank loans.Fed officials are generally inclined to preserve the rate because of its familiarity as a communications tool, a point reiterated by the minutes. But future policy would be set primarily by raising the rate the Fed pays banks on excess reserves, along with a second rate it would pay to investors for short-term loans. Those two rates would be set at a fixed interval bracketing the funds rate like crutches.Even after the Fed ends the expansion of the portfolio, it plans to maintain the size of its holdings by continuing to reinvest proceeds from matured bonds. Those proceeds, primarily from mortgage bonds, totaled $16 billion a month so far this year.The minutes said most Fed officials favored maintaining this reinvestment policy until after the central bank started to raise interest rates, to focus public attention on what officials regard as the most important lever of monetary policy.The account made for a striking contrast with the news conference held by Ms. Yellen three weeks ago, immediately after the committee\u2019s meeting. At the time, she declined to discuss the details of the Fed\u2019s exit strategy, saying that it remained under discussion and that details would come \u201clater this year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airline Passengers Weigh In With Online Reviews", "Date": "2014-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: AviationLONDON \u2014 A decade into the social media era, many travelers routinely consult online reviews before choosing vacation destinations or booking hotel rooms. Now the power of peer opinion has taken to the skies too, with the rise of websites that allow passengers to post and read comments on airlines, airports and even individual seats on particular planes.As carriers squeeze more people into economy cabins and charge fees for amenities like extra legroom that used to be free, some people are using sites like SeatGuru, Seatmaestro, Airline Ratings and others to safeguard the quality of their flying experience. Before booking a flight or choosing a seat, they will read reviews of an airline\u2019s food, get tips about where to find a little extra legroom and view photos of seats, entertainment consoles and power outlets.\u201cWhether we\u2019re booking a flight, whether we\u2019re buying a washing machine, we\u2019re going to have a quick read of what other people have to say,\u201d said Peter Miller, spokesman for Skytrax, which operates the sites Airlinequality and Flatseats. It is \u201csimply a quest for information,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is looking for \u2018How do we get the best value?\u201d\u2019The use of such sites is already beginning to expand beyond an original niche market of flight buffs and frequent business travelers and is likely to grow steadily more mainstream, many in the industry say.The list of review sites \u201ckeeps getting longer almost every day now,\u201d said Stathis Kefallonitis, founder of the consulting firm branding.aero and a marketing professor at the State University of New York in Oswego. Many sites provide information that they gather themselves, like annotated seat maps, with reviews posted by passengers.Rapid changes in the on-board offerings of airlines and differences in the amenities that various carriers include in their ticket prices have left passengers unsure of what to expect, and hungry for accurate information, Mr. Miller said. The growth of code-share arrangements meanwhile has meant that passengers increasingly book a ticket on one airline but end up flying a less familiar one.\u201cCustomers themselves are getting confused,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to look up, \u2018What is Air China like, or Korean Air,\u2019 or whatever we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cThat is what is driving the majority of people,\u201d he added.The range of detail and opinion available online is staggering. Food-focused sites like InflightFeed and AirplaneFood host reviews and pictures of meals and snacks. Elsewhere, travelers offer opinions about flight attendants\u2019 friendliness, assess the quality of airport lounges and report which seats lack windows or are placed on top of entertainment boxes that limit foot space.\u201cGreat seat!\u201d Adam Easter wrote on Seatmaestro, describing his spot on a British Airways flight from Washington to London. \u201cPlenty of legroom when seat in front of you is reclined.\u201d A reviewer identified as Nadya was less impressed with the same carrier\u2019s London to Los Angeles route. \u201cVery disappointed with the leg space in economy class,\u201d she wrote on Seatmaestro. \u201cWe both have sore legs and its three days after the flight.\u201dOn Routehappy, a United Airlines passenger identified as Eric W., who flew from Newark, New Jersey, to Seattle during the Super Bowl in February, noted the lack of an on-board Internet connection, but said the pilot \u201cwas extremely cool to connect an AM radio broadcast of the game with Channel 9 on the audio system. Huge points for that!\u201dMitchell Spearman, a fund-raiser for Occidental College in Los Angeles who flies at least 120,000 miles a year for work, said he never gets on board without checking SeatGuru, particularly since his usual carrier, US Airways, merged with American Airlines, leaving him often on unfamiliar planes.Seat \u201c2C on US Air could be completely different on a 757 than 2C on American,\u201d he said. Particularly important to him is having access to an electrical outlet. \u201cThat makes the difference for a three-hour flight to be productive or for it to be a nap,\u201d he said, adding that he even looks up the configuration of the outlet so he knows which charger to bring. Before booking a recent Miami-to-Los Angeles trip, Mr. Spearman said he had learned that one flight option would put him on a narrow-body plane, while another would offer him a wide-bodied Boeing 777. \u201cAfter reading the reviews, I realized it would be far better to wait two hours\u201d and take the bigger, more comfortable aircraft, he said.\u201cThere is a cohort of airplane warriors that literally have their offices in the skies,\u201d Mr. Spearman said. \u201cThey want to know what is being offered before they book the ticket.\u201dRoutehappy focuses on helping passengers do exactly that, rating options with a \u201chappiness score\u201d based on seat space, on-board entertainment and other factors. John Walton, the company\u2019s director of data, said that many fliers also used it to help them decide whether it would be worth paying for an upgrade to get access to an exit-row or premium economy seat.\u201cThe meals could run out, the staff could be very rude, the flight could be late, but choosing the aircraft as best you can or the seat as best as you can is in your control,\u201d said Andrew Wong, regional director at SeatGuru and its parent company, TripAdvisor.SeatGuru, Mr. Wong said, gets about 2.5 million unique visitors each month and has collected more than 50,000 comments since it began in 2001.The airlines themselves have started to recognize the benefits of offering passengers more details before they fly, said Jason Clampet, co-founder of Skift, a travel news website based in New York. \u201cThey see that the more information we give you about the seat, the more we can sell you,\u201d he said.Robert Ontell, a lawyer in Manhattan, said that he checked SeatGuru or similar sites just about every time he flies, but that he found them less useful than they were a few years ago, because the most comfortable seats were now reserved for passengers who choose to pay extra.Mr. Ontell also said he did not think airline review sites were likely to become as widely used as those that cover hotels, because passengers often have little choice of which carrier to fly. He prioritizes price, schedule and frequent flier miles over comfort and service when buying a ticket, he said, although he makes an effort to choose a good seat afterwards.That is true for many economy travelers, Mr. Kefallonitis said. Still, he expected flight review sites\u2019 growth to continue.\u201cThey\u2019re going to end up reviewing the entire journey,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom the booking site online to getting your luggage at your destination.\u201dAs with online reviews of other products, Mr. Kefallonitis said, he worries about how accurate comments are, and whether sites, some of which accept advertisements from airlines, are trustworthy.What is more, he added, passengers have to be willing to put in the effort to make them useful.\u201cYou really have to have the time and the patience to do this,\u201d said Raphael Farkas, a frequent traveler based in Montreal who scours sites like FlyerTalk every time he buys a plane ticket. \u201cOr you have to be crazy, like I am.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Millions of pilgrims bathe along Varanasi\u2019s ancient riverfront, but a stream of human waste flows directly into the river just above the bathing ghats, steps leading down to the river.\u00a0SHEOHAR DISTRICT, India \u2014 He wore thick black eyeliner to ward off the evil eye, but Vivek, a tiny 1-year-old living in a village of mud huts and diminutive people, had nonetheless fallen victim to India\u2019s great scourge of malnutrition.So why was Vivek malnourished?Like almost everyone else in their village, Vivek and his family have no toilet, and the district where they live has the highest concentration of people who defecate outdoors. As a result, children are exposed to a bacterial brew that often sickens them, leaving them unable to attain a healthy body weight no matter how much food they eat.\u201cOur realization about the connection between stunting and sanitation is just emerging,\u201d said Sue Coates, chief of water, sanitation and hygiene at Unicef India. \u201cAt this point, it is still just an hypothesis, but it is an incredibly exciting and important one because of its potential impact.\u201dThis research has quietly swept through many of the world\u2019s nutrition and donor organizations in part because it resolves a great mystery: Why are Indian children so much more malnourished than their poorer counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa?In Sheohar, for instance, a toilet-building program between 2001 and 2011 decreased the share of households without toilets to 80 percent from 87 percent, but population growth meant that exposure to human waste rose by half.Open defecation has long been an issue in India. Some ancient Hindu texts advised people to relieve themselves far from home, a practice that Gandhi sought to curb.Few rural households build the sort of inexpensive latrines that have all but eliminated outdoor waste in neighboring Bangladesh.One analysis found that government spending on toilets pays for itself in increased tax receipts from greater productivity, but the math works only if every member of a family who gets a toilet uses it.\u201cWe need a cultural revolution in this country to completely change people\u2019s attitudes toward sanitation and hygiene,\u201d said Jairam Ramesh, an economist and former sanitation minister.India\u2019s government has for decades tried to resolve the country\u2019s stubborn malnutrition problems by distributing vast stores of subsidized food. But more and better food has largely failed to reverse early stunting, studies have repeatedly shown.India now spends about $26 billion annually on food and jobs programs, and less than $400 million on improving sanitation \u2014 a ratio of more than 60 to 1.\u201cWe need to reverse that ratio entirely,\u201d Dr. Laxminarayan said.Better sanitation in the West during the 19th and early 20th centuries led to huge improvements in health long before the advent of vaccines and antibiotics, and researchers have long known that childhood environments play a crucial role in child death and adult height.So widespread housing discrimination that confines many Muslims to separate slums may protect their children from increased exposure to the higher levels of waste in Hindu communities and, as a result, save thousands of Indian Muslim babies from death each year.Just building more toilets, however, may not be enough to save India\u2019s children.Phool Mati lives in a neighborhood in Varanasi with 12 public toilets, but her 1-year-old grandson, Sandeep, is nonetheless severely malnourished. His mother tries to feed him lentils, milk and other foods as often as she can, but Sandeep is rarely hungry because he is so often sick, Ms. Mati said.\u201cWe all use the bathroom,\u201d she said.The effluent pipe that served the bathroom building is often clogged. Raw sewage seeps into an adjoining Hindu temple, and, during the monsoon season, it flooded the neighborhood\u2019s homes. The matron of the toilet facility charges two rupees for each use, so most children relieve themselves directly into open drains that run along a central walkway.Millions of pilgrims bathe in the Ganges along Varanasi\u2019s ancient riverfront, but a stream of human waste \u2014 nearly 75 million liters per day \u2014 flows directly into the river just above the bathing ghats, steps leading down to the river. Many people wash or brush their teeth beside smaller sewage outlets.\u201cIndia\u2019s problems are bigger than just open defecation and a lack of toilets,\u201d Dr. Laxminarayan said.Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Formula One Approves Rule Changes for Next Season", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: British Grand PrixIn its first season with revamped technical regulations designed to make the traditionally gas-guzzling series more environmentally friendly, Formula One is now steeped in a process of soul-searching as it seeks to become more fan-friendly.At this point, seven of the season\u2019s eight races have been won by the same team \u2014 Mercedes, which built the fastest, quietest, most efficient engine according to the new stipulations \u2014 and now the series faces one of its regular crises over how the rules should be tailored to improve the show. But the return to the Silverstone circuit this weekend for the 50th edition of the British Grand Prix is also a reminder that despite constant rule-changes since the first race at Silverstone in 1950 \u2014 which was also the first race of the Formula One series \u2014 the top level of auto racing has survived for decades with stretches of domination by one team or driver or another without trying to spice up the show. Last week the series nonetheless approved a number of changes for 2015 aimed at doing just that. Modifications to engines this season resulted in quiet cars, a radical step in a series where much of the spectacle has long been associated with the eardrum-breaking roar of the engines. The new rules for next season include adding titanium underbellies to produce sparks that fly out of the rear end of the cars as they race on the track at high speed; standing starts after safety-car periods, rather than the current rolling starts, to increase the chance of a change in leader; and promoting risk-taking and passing with more lenience toward drivers who run into other drivers. At least one recent proposal has not yet been approved, however: adding sound to the quiet engines by putting \u201ctrumpets\u201d on the exhaust pipes. In the early years of the series, fans accepted long, processional races dominated by a single car or driver as simply part of the nature of the sport. But as Formula One has become a global event with a worldwide television audience, competing with other global sports like soccer and tennis or even with popular entertainment for fans and advertisers, the series has become more sensitive to the idea of catering to fans and their evolving tastes.It has changed the rules frequently in the past decade to liven things up, including creating various power-burst mechanisms to facilitate passing, reducing tire life to force pit stops, and overhauling the qualifying sessions. Although team leaders, drivers and the news media now speak regularly about the need to please the fans and provide them with a better show, the most publicized and vocal critics of the series this year have not been the fans, but the series itself. Foremost among them are the directors of the Ferrari team, whose engine has failed to perform as well as that of Mercedes.\u201cI know that Formula One is about Ferrari, and that Ferrari is about Formula One,\u201d said Marco Mattiacci, Ferrari\u2019s sporting director. \u201cWe will work in order to improve and to make sure that we will have a Formula One that will appeal to a wider audience.\u201dThe crux of the problem this year is not a lack of show, however. The series has had eight fabulous races with surprise winners, underdogs finishing on the podium and the two teammates who lead the championship engaged in a protracted battle on track and off. So why the crisis about lack of excitement? The first reason may be Ferrari\u2019s engine troubles. It is difficult to imagine that the team would complain if it were winning every race.But the main complaint of Luca di Montezemolo, the Ferrari president, is that the series is trying too hard to be environmentally friendly, thereby forcing drivers to race according to fuel-economy needs rather than in all-out pursuit of victory in a high-speed race to the end. He even went so far as to say at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in mid-June that the world\u2019s leading endurance race was a better auto sport show than Formula One and that Ferrari would consider joining Le Mans in the future. He apparently did not realize, however, that Le Mans is on an even greater fuel-saving campaign than Formula One, with a per-lap fuel quota rather than a limit per race as in Formula One.But evidence of a decline in Formula One\u2019s popularity among fans can be seen in a television-ratings drop in some of the series\u2019 major markets, including Germany and Italy. For the first five races of this year, ratings in Italy were down 20 percent compared with last year, according to the Spanish sports daily Marca, and in Germany they fell 10 percent last year and have continued to drop a further 3 percent this year. These figures reflect a decision by the series\u2019 promoter to show the races on pay-television channels, instead of the free-to-air broadcasters that helped the series build its worldwide popularity over the last 40 years. Fans who have had free access to a television show their entire lives may now be reluctant to pay for it.Meanwhile, Formula One has not effectively turned to the Internet to reach fans. But the Internet is now the only mass medium that can replace television to give sponsors exposure to the sport\u2019s hundreds of millions of fans around the world. One reason Bernie Ecclestone, the series\u2019 promoter, who has made himself and the series rich thanks to television contracts, has not turned to the Internet is because he does not know how to make money from it. And that remains a challenge for the sport.\u201cWe know that it\u2019s taken a while for Formula One to do more in social media and it\u2019s a fact of life today, you can\u2019t ignore it,\u201d said Monisha Kaltenborn, director and part owner of the Sauber team. \u201cWe have to be careful and assess very carefully how we open it and how we can still monetize on it, because these are revenue streams which, if they come in correctly and the distribution is also the right way, it has, of course, an impact on all the other issues we are combating right now,\u201d she added, referring to broadcasting of Formula One. \u201cSo, it\u2019s all somehow connected \u2014 but you have to be careful when you open up to these kind of mechanisms.\u201dAt the same time, each team is judging the value of the Formula One show not in terms of viewer numbers but in terms of how well its car is doing or what its car needs to perform better. \u201cI think foremost and utmost Formula One is a show and it has to entertain,\u201d said Christian Horner, whose Red Bull team has won the title for the last four years but won its only race so far this season in Canada last month. \u201cI think a race like we had in Montreal is Formula One at its best,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to have and more of it \u2014 week in, week out. We need to give the public more access, more behind-the-scenes information and engage them more in what we do. I think we need more of Montreal. How we achieve that, of course, is the difficulty.\u201dBut Kaltenborn\u2019s point about upsetting the balance of the whole with the Internet may also apply to the new rule changes. Starting a race from a standing position on the grid can present problems such as overheating and stalling engines and wearing out tires. \u201cWhen you start a race you have new tires, so you could find yourself with five laps to go, six laps to go and your tires are almost bald already and you need flat out laps to keep heat in them,\u201d said Jenson Button, a driver at McLaren. \u201cSo you will struggle off the line and it will be tricky for all of us to keep the car pointing in the same direction off the start. It could cause mayhem.\u201d There, perhaps, lies another truth: The series has gone 20 years without the death of a driver. Through much of its first 45 years, however, Formula One was so dangerous that the threat of death was a thrilling show in itself. Now, the series has apparently become so safe that the issue of enhancing the show is a luxury afforded by safety measures and the ensuing sense of security.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gruesome Attacks in Kenyan Villages Heighten Fears of a Nation on Edge ", "Date": "2014-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 More than 20 people were killed in two attacks on Kenya\u2019s coast on Saturday night \u2014 with residents saying that many of the victims had their hands bound and their throats slit \u2014 in the latest in a string of gruesome assaults with ethnic undercurrents.The violence has deeply unnerved this country at a time of increasing insecurity and rising political tensions. Nonetheless, Kenya\u2019s leading opposition politician, Raila Odinga, vowed on Sunday to press ahead with a large demonstration in downtown Nairobi, the capital, on Monday.The Kenyan government fears that opposition supporters may try to occupy a public park, setting up what could be a bloody showdown with the police. Government officials said that such a sit-in would be illegal and that they would not allow the center of Nairobi to be turned into a Kenyan version of Tahrir Square, the plaza in Egypt\u2019s capital, Cairo, that became the foremost symbol of the Arab Spring uprisings.Many Kenyans are worried about the Monday rally, given the heightened insecurity and strained mood. Some families have already begun to flee ethnically mixed areas in Nairobi and surrounding towns after leaflets mysteriously surfaced warning members of certain ethnic groups to leave.\u201cGovernment, opposition must step back from the brink,\u201d read the lead editorial in the Sunday Nation, one of Kenya\u2019s biggest newspapers.Over the past few weeks, Kenya\u2019s opposition leaders have held a number of boisterous rallies across the country, all of them peaceful. But the government is taking no chances about Monday\u2019s event, timed to commemorate the anniversary of Kenya\u2019s multiparty democracy movement that began in 1990. Thousands of police officers will be deployed throughout Nairobi with orders to keep roads open and trade flowing. Even so, many businesses have advised employees and customers to stay away from downtown, fearing that riots could break out.At the same time, Kenya\u2019s security forces seem overwhelmed by the spate of killings along the coast that the government has called politically motivated.According to the police inspector general, two villages, Hindi and Gamba, were attacked around the same time at about 11 p.m. Saturday, with dozens of armed intruders killing civilians, blasting their way into a jail and burning down houses and a church. Residents said that, as with other recent attacks, most of the victims were Kikuyus \u2014 the same ethnic group as Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta \u2014 and that many had been slaughtered with knives, their hands tied behind their backs.Police officers said they found a blackboard placed in a road near the killings that said \u201cRaila Tosha,\u201d which means \u201cRaila\u2019s enough,\u201d and \u201cKick Christians out of coast,\u201d suggesting a domestic source for the violence rather than a foreign one. Those implications, whether true or not, are bound to push the political temperature even higher.The most obvious victim is Kenya\u2019s tourism industry, a pillar of the economy. Western governments, including the United States and Britain, have issued travel advisories, scaring away tourists. The Kenyan coast is usually packed in the summer with kite surfers, fishermen and sunburned European children digging holes in the sand. But now countless hotels have closed or nearly shut down, laying off legions of cooks, maids, waiters, drivers and many others who support their families with tourism jobs.\u201cIt\u2019s so terribly, depressingly empty,\u201d a hotel manager said Sunday night. \u201cIt\u2019s made me rethink all my plans. You just don\u2019t know now. It may be time to buy some land in Europe.\u201dStreet crime also seems to be getting worse. On Sunday, just hours after the raids on the villages, a Western tourist was killed in a botched robbery while she was visiting an old fort in Mombasa. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sizing Up Black Markets and Red-Light Districts for G.D.P.", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 As the spokesman for the National Association of Sex Clubs in Spain, Jos\u00e9 Roca has fielded all sorts of offbeat inquiries. But rarely has he been more flummoxed than when he received a call late last year from the government statistics agency.In earnest tones, a statistician asked him if he knew the average price of a session with a prostitute in Spain, and the typical cost of a room at a Spanish brothel.\u201cHe even asked stupid questions like how much energy is consumed by a club,\u201d recalled Mr. Roca, whose Valencia-based group represents hundreds of so-called alternate clubs across Spain.\u201cI thought it was a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so incredulous that I asked them to send me an email to make sure it wasn\u2019t.\u201dThe questions were not a hoax, but part of a new effort to measure the size of the Spanish economy. As of September, all European Union countries will be required to take fuller accounting of trade in sex, drugs and other underground businesses as part of an overhaul of economic measurements by Eurostat, the European statistics agency.The point of counting everything, including the wages of sin, is to get a more accurate reading of each country\u2019s gross domestic product. Because G.D.P. is such an important number \u2014 one that can sway national policies and make or break politicians \u2014 the European Union wants numbers \u201cbetter reflecting the economic environment,\u201d Vincent Bourgeais, a Eurostat spokesman, said.With European Union governments obliged to reduce debt as a percentage of their economies, the changes are also expected to make growth rates from Spain to Sweden look better, possibly also making debt ratios seem rosier.Other measures besides vice will be recalibrated, like research and development, and charitable contributions. Those measures are certain to pump up G.D.P. figures much more than any gains registered from prostitution or cocaine production.Still, accounting for prostitutes and heroin can add billions to an economy. And as some countries try to dig out of the euro zone\u2019s nearly five-year growth slump, every little bit helps.\u201cAccording to my calculations, prostitution generates about 20 billion euros,\u201d or $27 billion, in Spain each year, Mr. Roca said. \u201cSpanish men often frequent clubs, and there\u2019s a lot of tourism,\u201d for example, from French clients just over the border.Mr. Roca\u2019s number is close to the government\u2019s estimate that \u20ac18 billion is generated by the legal sex trade in Spain. If that is added to G.D.P., Mr. Roca said, \u201cof course Spain will benefit.\u201dTechnically, reporting black-market economic activity has long been required under European Union regulations. But measuring the underground economy is hardly an exact science. Only a handful of countries, including the Netherlands, Italy and Germany, have even tried to fully comply.The European Union\u2019s new rules will require all 28 countries in the bloc to redouble their efforts, even if it means questioning brothel owners or tallying tons of cocaine seized from drug dealers.\u201cAgencies are able to gather information, but it hasn\u2019t been particularly accurate because we\u2019re talking about activities that people try to hide,\u201d said Gian Paolo Oneto, the director of national accounts at the Italian national statistics agency, Istat.\u201cThese rules say G.D.P. should include everything, even tomatoes grown in your backyard,\u201d Mr. Oneto added. \u201cBut sometimes, we can only estimate it. We can\u2019t go around counting the tomatoes.\u201dBecause the math can be fuzzy, economists have tended to be wary of such measurements. Italy holds a place in the annals of creative accounting for \u201cil sorpasso,\u201d or \u201cthe overtake,\u201d of 1987, when the government revalued G.D.P. to include the black-market economy. So large were the figures, which included estimates of tax evasion and illegal workers, that almost overnight Italy leapfrogged over Britain to become the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy.Now, as Italy struggles to pull out of a recession and labors under one of the developed world\u2019s biggest debt burdens, it will start counting smuggled alcohol and tobacco. Mr. Oneto declined to make a forecast, but he noted that Italy\u2019s overall black market already accounted for 15 percent of the country\u2019s \u20ac1.5 trillion economy.For most governments, illicit activity may count for little more than a rounding error. In the Netherlands, known for its red-light districts and marijuana coffee shops, such activity counts for 0.4 percent of G.D.P.The biggest boost to G.D.P. figures will come from something with no titillation value: a Eurostat revision allowing governments to count research and development as investments rather than costs. Finland and Sweden, hotbeds of high-tech capitalism, could increase the size of their economies by as much as 5 percent, according to Eurostat.In Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, which are struggling to overcome recessions, G.D.P. could increase by as much as 2 percent, Eurostat estimates, while Germany and France could see expansions of as much as 3 percent. Britain might show a gain of 3 to 4 percent, Eurostat said.In other countries, the issue transcends numbers.France\u2019s statistics agency is refusing to include drugs and sex work out of concern that prostitution, for example, often stems from sexual slavery and should not be given the veneer of economic legitimacy.Even some economists who see value in G.D.P. as a way to measure living standards nonetheless question the wisdom of trying to tally decadence.\u201cIf you think that drugs and prostitution are things that do not necessarily improve the quality of life in a country,\u201d said Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London, \u201cthen including them undermines G.D.P. as measure of well-being.\u201dBack in Valencia, Mr. Roca, the sex club representative, was suspicious that Spain would use the new data to gild its G.D.P. for political purposes, even as the nation slowly crawls out of a three-year recession.Statistics agencies, though, say that whatever the improved ratios, debt will not be easier to service, because governments cannot collect taxes from illegal underground activity.In which case, Mr. Roca says, he fails to see the point. \u201cThe whole thing,\u201d he said, \u201cis a huge stupidity.\u201dRachel Chaundler contributed reporting from Zaragoza, Spain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Taliban\u2019s Revival, Dread Returns to Swat Valley", "Date": "2014-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySWAT VALLEY, Pakistan \u2014 As battle rages in North Waziristan, where the Pakistani military says it has killed more than 500 militants, unfinished business from the army\u2019s first major assault on the Taliban lingers painfully in the Swat Valley, at the other end of Pakistan\u2019s Pashtun belt.Five years ago, Pakistani soldiers flooded into Swat as part of an operation to banish the Taliban from the valley. The offensive became a cherished victory for Pakistani generals, who presented it as evidence of their counterinsurgency prowess.But a steady drumbeat of killings, by both militants and soldiers, has whipped up fear in Swat in recent years and blighted hopes for a return to normality in a place known for its beauty and tourist industry. Taliban fighters have slowly crept back to attack and kill pro-government community leaders. The army faces accusations of gross human rights abuses, including the execution of at least dozens of detainees whose bodies have recently been returned to their families.And Maulana Fazlullah, the ruthless cleric and militant commander who led the original Swat uprising in 2007, has evaded capture and risen to greater heights as the supreme leader of the Pakistani Taliban.\u201cFor a long time there was a narrative of the Swat operation as a total success,\u201d said Rahimullah Yousafzai, a veteran journalist based in Peshawar. \u201cNow that success is being questioned.\u201dFew doubt that conditions in Swat have improved dramatically. Bloodied bodies no longer hang from traffic lights in the town square where the Taliban once executed their enemies. Markets are bustling, and more girls are attending school.But the campaign of Taliban violence, though sporadic, has rattled public confidence. \u201cThis is a controlled peace,\u201d said Akbar Khan, a 38-year-old bookseller. And it offers a sobering check on the limits of military engagement at a time when the army is engaged in a fresh anti-Taliban drive in the tribal district of North Waziristan.There, more than one million people have fled their homes since the operation started on June 15. The military, which tightly controls media access, has portrayed it as an unalloyed success, drip-feeding reports of battlefield victories to the Pakistani media. On Saturday, a spokesman said its forces had killed 531 militants and lost just 34 men. Similarly triumphant claims followed the 2009 Swat offensive, but some successes proved to be temporary. Although hundreds of Taliban fighters were captured, many more slipped across the porous border into the Afghan provinces of Kunar and Nuristan, where they have successfully regrouped.In the last two years, small pockets of fighters have infiltrated back into Swat, moving along remote mountain trails on horseback and on foot, according to villagers. But for the most part, the Taliban gunmen have targeted the Village Defense Committees \u2014 local militias, mounted by the army to keep the Taliban at bay \u2014 which lost nine leaders to Taliban attacks in 2013, and eight so far this year. In the most recent shooting, on Tuesday, gunmen opened fire on Umar Hayat Khan, the committee leader in Takhta Band village, as he said his prayers in a local mosque.Two weeks earlier, gunmen killed Khan Saib, a landowner who had just returned from self-imposed exile in Saudi Arabia. A relative said that Mr. Saib had fled Swat after the Taliban demolished his house in 2009, and had been attacked twice before his death.The shootings have scared Swat residents because their targets are prominent community leaders \u2014 often landowners or members of the Awami National Party, a secular party that has borne the brunt of Taliban violence across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province.The army itself has been another cause of concern in Swat as it has cast a wide net for militants.\u201cMost of these detainees are in their 20s or early 30s. It\u2019s unusual for men of that age to die from a heart attack,\u201d said Mustafa Qadri of Amnesty International. In Swat, the wives and children of detained men hold regular protests against the military. The most recent took place on July 20 in the village of Kanju, where women waved photos and held placards calling for judicial intervention. \u201cLet the courts decide if they are guilty,\u201d read one.While mistreatment of detainees offends rights groups, many Swat residents have a more ambivalent attitude, said Mr. Yousafzai, the journalist. \u201cThe community is very polarized,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people don\u2019t want to hear about the suffering of militants or their families.\u201dPublic opinion had been further divided by plans for three permanent military bases in Swat. Some citizens want the army to leave; others fear a return to civilian rule would lead to a Taliban resurgence. \u201cPeople remember that the last time, the civilians ran away,\u201d Mr. Yousafzai said.Main theaters of conflict in northwestern Pakistan.But caution is widespread. Kiran, a dancer who would give only her first name, said she refused to work outside the main town, Mingora. Some business owners have left the valley over security fears. And tourism numbers are way down, said Zahid Khan, head of the Swat hotel owners\u2019 association.More recently, Mr. Fazlullah has increased violence inside Swat in a bid to shore up his authority inside the Taliban, following a split in the militant ranks last May. In a rare video message released on May 19, he directed suicide bombers to attack \u201cthe forces of evil.\u201d The military, for its part, is focused on the campaign in North Waziristan. But that has also touched Swat, in the form of refugees who have made an arduous journey across northwestern Pakistan to the verdant valley in search of shelter.The authorities in Swat have registered almost 600 refugees from Waziristan, many of whom are living in cramped rented accommodations.Speaking at a religious charity\u2019s food distribution event, Hajji Nooruddin, a 50-year-old truck driver from Miram Shah, said he was sharing a house with 25 other people.Asif Nawaz, 21, said he was stuck in a traffic jam for two days as he fled North Waziristan. During that time, he saw two mothers take the bodies of their dead infants to the soldiers, shouting that they had died from hunger, he said with tears in his eyes.However, many of the refugees said they were glad to have reached Swat \u2014 a place of relative safety, compared with North Waziristan.An employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from the Swat District in Pakistan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Child of the Slum Rises as President of Indonesia", "Date": "2014-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Joko Widodo, the governor of Jakarta whose common touch has made him a political phenomenon, was declared the winner of Indonesia\u2019s presidential election on Tuesday, completing an improbable ascent from child of the slums to leader of the world\u2019s fourth-most populous nation.But the announcement, while widely expected, did not end a simmering controversy. His opponent, Prabowo Subianto, a retired army general, rejected the results as fraudulent and said he was withdrawing from the race. The General Elections Commission announced that Mr. Joko, with 53 percent of the vote, had beaten Mr. Prabowo, with 47 percent. Nearly 135 million Indonesians cast ballots in the emotionally charged July 9 election, in which voters chose a new president for the first time in 10 years.There was a huge police presence at the commission\u2019s offices in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, on Tuesday as the vote tabulations were completed, amid rumors of violent street demonstrations by disappointed supporters of Mr. Prabowo.As the elections commission was finishing its count and preparing to announce Mr. Joko as the winner, representatives of Mr. Prabowo\u2019s campaign staged a walkout at the commission\u2019s offices. Shortly afterward, Mr. Prabowo read an impassioned statement to supporters at his campaign headquarters, saying he had withdrawn his candidacy and would reject the results.\u201cThere has been a massive, structured and systematic fraud,\u201d he said.But on Tuesday night, his brother and chief adviser, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, said Mr. Prabowo had not in fact withdrawn his candidacy, but was instead demanding additional time for the elections commission to investigate \u201cserious problems\u201d in both ballot casting and vote tabulations.Commission officials, however, rejected his campaign\u2019s allegations and said a candidate\u2019s withdrawal would have no bearing on the results.Mr. Hashim said Mr. Prabowo\u2019s campaign team had not yet decided whether to appeal the election results to the Indonesian Constitutional Court.\u201cWe want the K.P.U. to take a serious look at these irregularities,\u201d Mr. Hashim said, referring to the elections commission by its Indonesian abbreviation.The Constitutional Court has the sole authority to order recounts or new voting at the provincial level and below, and its decisions are binding. The court has two weeks to issue any decision should there be an appeal. But analysts said it was highly unlikely that any ruling would overturn the final national result, given the eight-million-vote margin of Mr. Joko\u2019s victory.What amounted to declarations of victory by both camps hours after the polls closed led to weeks of uncertainty as the commission tabulated votes from more than 480,000 polling stations. Mr. Joko is to be sworn in Oct. 20. He has pledged to bring more \u201cpeople-centric\u201d governance and policies to Indonesia, which, despite being a member of the G-20 group of major economies, has more than 100 million people living on $2 a day or less.The victory represents a striking rise for Mr. Joko, 53, who was born and raised in a riverside slum area in the city of Surakarta, also known as Solo, in Central Java Province. He grew up to be a carpenter and later a furniture exporter before entering politics in 2005. He was twice elected mayor of his hometown, then governor of Jakarta in 2012.Mr. Joko, a thin, unassuming figure with what he has described as a typical \u201cvillage face,\u201d will be Indonesia\u2019s seventh president and the first not to have emerged from the country\u2019s political elite or to have been an army general.Mr. Prabowo, 62, was a son-in-law of Suharto, the authoritarian president who was forced to resign in 1998 after 32 years in power amid pro-democracy street demonstrations. Mr. Prabowo, a successful businessman who comes from a prominent Javanese political family, has a checkered military record, including allegations of human rights abuses as a commander of Indonesia\u2019s Special Forces and later as head of the army\u2019s strategic reserve command. He was denied a visa to enter the United States in 2000 and is believed to be on an unofficial blacklist.Sitting barefoot inside a small rented house in central Jakarta a few days before Tuesday\u2019s announcement, Mr. Joko said in an interview that Indonesia\u2019s continuing democratic transition had broken the grip of the entrenched political elite on the government. Of crucial importance to this, he said, was the introduction of direct elections from president all the way down to town mayor a decade ago, as part of a national decentralization policy that replaced Suharto\u2019s centralized system of governance.Mr. Joko will lead a country that has successfully consolidated its democracy and enjoyed strong economic growth under the departing president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who has served two five-year terms. Indonesia has had one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia in recent years, along with China and India. But that same economy, which achieved annual growth rates of more than 6 percent from 2010 to 2012, mostly thanks to the country\u2019s abundant natural resources and robust domestic consumption, is facing several serious challenges.They include a trade deficit, a national fuel subsidy that sucks tens of billions of dollars each year from the state budget, inadequate infrastructure, corruption, poverty and a growing disparity between the country\u2019s rich and poor.During the bruising presidential campaign, Mr. Prabowo characterized Mr. Joko as an unsophisticated, small-town politician who lacked the ability to lead a large nation. But Mr. Joko noted that he would be the only president in Indonesian history to take office with prior experience in running a government.\u201cIt\u2019s about management,\u201d Mr. Joko said. \u201cHow to plan, how to organize, how to decide actions. In my opinion, the most important thing in governance is management control.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Central Java. It is a province of Indonesia, not a state.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Tenacious Show Finds a New Stage", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver 15 years, it has encountered the withdrawal of a major star, the death of a key collaborator and the tumult of Sept. 11, resulting in several prolonged states of limbo. In the macabre tale, Ms. Rivera\u2019s character, a widow who has amassed obscene amounts of wealth as well as a few artificial limbs, returns to her hometown to strike a devil\u2019s bargain with the Swiss villagers who scorned her in her youth. In exchange for rescuing the town\u2019s residents from poverty, Claire proposes that they assist in a plan of vengeance against a former lover, Anton Schell (Roger Rees), who betrayed her years before. At first, the villagers are outraged by the shocking proposal, but their protests subside when they realize the windfall that would come their way.The creative team pushed on with Ms. Rivera as the new star for a regional production at the Goodman Theater in Chicago in the fall of 2001. But the Sept. 11 attacks occurred just 10 days before the show\u2019s first preview, and producers couldn\u2019t get potential investors or New York critics to see it before the end of its six-week run.\u201cIt was genuinely a victim of timing,\u201d said Terrence McNally, the show\u2019s book writer. \u201cPeople were afraid to get on airplanes.\u201dNow with Mr. Doyle at the helm, \u201cThe Visit\u201d is getting another shot \u2014 and is again being closely watched, considering the names attached. Still, its creators say they\u2019re enjoying the chance to work on the piece in a quiet corner of the Berkshires. Amid the green hills here,\u00a0a palpable sense of familial camaraderie seems to have enveloped the entire enterprise, since many of the artists have known one an other for decades. Mr. Kander and Ms. Rivera share a close friendship that goes back to before she originated the role of Velma Kelly in \u201cChicago\u201d in the mid-\u201970s.She has learned to be patient. With a conspiratorial air, she noted that Mr. McNally has said, \u201cWell, Chita, if the show doesn\u2019t happen anytime soon, Claire\u2019s got one leg and one hand, so you could just do her in a wheelchair if need be.\u201d She gave a hearty laugh. \u201cSo I\u2019m a little ahead of that right now.\u201d After the cast spilled out of rehearsal for the day, Mr. Kander was asked what Ebb would have made of the team still plugging away at \u201cThe Visit\u201d all these years later.\u201cI think Freddie would give up easier,\u201d he responded. \u201cSometimes he would say, \u2018Do you think we should really keep on doing this?\u2019 \u2014 particularly if we did something and it failed or got bad reviews.\u201d But he added: \u201cIf I believed in it, and if it fills me, I just wanted to do it. And this piece very much fills me.\u201dUnlike in that and other Doyle productions, the cast of \u201cThe Visit\u201d will not double as musicians. Still, Mr. Doyle said he knew he\u2019d have to reduce the size of the orchestra and the cast. (There are 16 actors, down from 26 at the Goodman.) He further suggested streamlining aspects of the two-act script and combining characters, while fleshing out the relationship between Claire and Anton.To work away from prying eyes, Mr. Doyle asked Mr. Kirdahy and the show\u2019s creators if he could do a workshop with musical-theater students at Pace University, where Mr. Doyle was an artist in residence. The April workshop convinced him to that it would be best to stage \u201cThe Visit\u201d in one act to build momentum and emphasize its roots as a parable. It also allowed him a chance to test out one of his bolder ideas: bolstering the presence of the young Claire and Anton, underscoring the love story beneath the bitterness. In the first two productions, the young lovers showed up in flashbacklike sequences. But in his version, \u201cthey\u2019re omnipresent,\u201d Mr. Doyle said. \u201cThis is a piece about mortality and about how the sins of the past will come back to haunt us, and I really wanted to bring that theme out,\u201d he added. \u201cI thought it could be really theatrical and interesting to have the young couple onstage all the time, watching themselves as older people, and then gradually for the older couple to become aware of their younger selves.\u201dMr. McNally also maintained that the musical\u2019s acerbic social commentary is even more timely than it was in 2008 at the Signature, a few months before the world economy nearly collapsed. \u201cIt has very strong moral implications \u2014 about the price we pay to quote \u2018be happy\u2019 and \u2018successful,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. Another dark Kander and Ebb musical, \u201cThe Scottsboro Boys,\u201d made it to Broadway in 2010. It was critically acclaimed and creatively daring, yet financially unsuccessful. Still, Mr. Kirdahy, who has a team of commercial investors enhancing the Williamstown production, remains undaunted, even if he\u2019s not ready to think about hanging up a marquee just yet.\u201cWe need to know what we have, and that will inform future steps,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t get ahead of ourselves. There is a long history here, and you want to nurture it properly.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In U.S. Data, a Baffling Contradiction", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceThe first quarter of this year was the worst for the United States economy since the depths of the Great Recession in early 2009.During the same period, employers hired more people than in any quarter over the last six years, signaling gathering strength in the economy.It is hard to imagine how both of those statements could be true, but they are what government statistics indicate.While the employment numbers have been strong, the government sharply cut its estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product late last month. It had previously said the economy declined at an annual rate of 1 percent during the quarter \u2014 a small dip that could be explained by severe weather in much of the country. The new figures showed a 2.9 percent rate of decline, the worst since a 5.4 percent drop in the first three months of 2009.What happened? Put simply, a single government survey produced highly dubious numbers. Those who conduct the survey say it was done normally and that nothing suspicious surfaced in the responses. But \u2014 particularly in the case of one vital part of the economy \u2014 that survey contradicted other available information. The result was suspiciously low revenue estimates for companies in both health services and food retailing.\u201cIf activity in these sectors was really as weak\u201d as the G.D.P. figures indicate, said Dean Maki, the chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, \u201cone would think employers would have caught on to this by now and stopped hiring aggressively.\u201dThe big decline in estimates of the size of the United States economy was caused primarily by a sharp reversal in the government\u2019s estimate of spending on health care services.There was a significant increase in Medicaid spending in the first quarter, said Benjamin A. Mandel, an economist who is chief of the federal branch of the bureau\u2019s government division. He said that increase was one reason the early estimate was so positive. He also said that increase had been expected because, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid coverage expanded at the beginning of the year in many states.But the revised estimate released in June said that spending on health care services fell at an annual rate of 0.9 percent. Instead of the largest increase in more than a decade, it was the first decline in nearly half a century, since the third quarter of 1965. That one change accounted for most of the decline in the estimate for overall first-quarter G.D.P.Behind that reversal were the results of a quarterly survey of service providers. The survey, conducted by the Census Bureau, asks 18,000 companies in 11 service industries about their revenue and expenses. Health care providers, including physicians and hospitals, reported a decline in revenue from the previous quarter.Because that survey is supposed to cover all sources of revenue, including money from patients, insurance companies and the government, it is taken as definitive in calculating spending on health care services.Anne S. Russell, an assistant division chief in the Census Bureau who is responsible for the services survey, told me that no obvious red flags emerged. The response rate was within normal limits, she said. The figure will be revised in three months, but only to pick up late responses or reports from companies saying they made mistakes in their first filings. Such changes are seldom very large. Eventually, there will be a more comprehensive annual survey, which could change the numbers, Ms. Russell said.Mr. Mandel, the B.E.A. economist, said the bureau was trying to figure out what happened. \u201cOn the why, I don\u2019t have a clear answer,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe are trying to come up with theories.\u201dThere are some possible explanations. Many of those who signed up for private health insurance under the Affordable Care Act did not do so until March and did not become covered until April or May. It could make sense for such people to defer some health care until they were covered.That may have been what happened in 1965, the other year when health care spending declined in a quarter. That occurred while Congress was passing the legislation that established Medicare, beginning in 1966. There were large increases in health care spending after Medicare went into effect.Still, if that is the explanation, then it would hardly be reasonable to assume that weakness in health care spending continued in the second quarter. But Mr. Maki, the Barclays economist, said it appeared the latest monthly estimates of spending for health care and other things, including food consumption, assume that first-quarter weakness will continue.Stunned by the G.D.P. report, Mr. Maki put together a model that uses other available data \u2014 hours worked, industrial production and new claims for unemployment insurance \u2014 to estimate G.D.P. In the past, he said, that model has done a reasonably good job of estimating the change in real G.D.P. going back to 1967. For the first quarter, it estimates a growth rate of 3 percent, rather than the official figure of a 2.9 percent decline. That is the largest discrepancy ever.Barclays maintains a running estimate of each quarter\u2019s G.D.P. based on other statistics as they are released. If the current estimate of 2.7 percent is correct, the rebound would not be enough to offset the first quarter, leaving the economy showing negative growth for the first six months of 2014.If the first-quarter G.D.P. report is wrong, can we expect it to be changed? The B.E.A. will release annual revisions at the end of this month, but there is not likely to be a lot of new information by then. As a result, any change might not be reported until 2018, the next scheduled comprehensive revision. By then, figures for this year\u2019s first quarter are likely to be of little interest.This is, he said, one of those times. \u201cThe first-quarter real G.D.P. number simply makes no sense.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Worse Than the L.I.R.R.? Not Having It", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe signature gesture of a Long Island Rail Road commuter is a shrug. It stands for crankiness, vexation and fatigue; it answers unannounced rain delays and torn seats. The shrug is often followed by a sigh, and inevitable submission to the vagaries of the twice-daily convoy.But in recent days, as a strike deadline loomed and labor negotiations sputtered, shoulders have become hunched up around ears as riders weigh onerous contingency plans. Riders love their train; they hate their train. But they certainly don\u2019t want to do without it.\u201cIt\u2019s been at least 25 years of hell,\u201d said Jill Citron, 56, a corporate travel agent, making her usual trip on the 5:22 from Pennsylvania Station to Wyandanch in her preferred last-row aisle seat on Tuesday. And yet, she added, \u201cif there\u2019s no train, it\u2019s awful.\u201dNegotiations between the railroad, which carries about 300,000 weekday commuters, and its unions had broken down on Monday. On Wednesday, the tone appeared to shift. The parties resumed talks after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who oversees the railroad\u2019s operator, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, urged the sides to return to the table.\u201cWe must do everything we can to prevent Long Islanders from being held hostage by a strike that would damage the regional economy and be highly disruptive for commuters,\u201d he said in a statement.Travelers\u2019 foul moods were exacerbated on Tuesday evening by tumultuous weather, combined with visions of hourslong car or bus commutes on the traffic-plagued Long Island Expressway in the event of a strike.At least two hulking plastic wheelbarrows caught drips from a leaky ceiling in Penn Station. Commuters groaned as they got word of weather delays. And they fumed about the casual pose of some politicians just four days before the strike deadline, which is 12:01 a.m. on Sunday.Nelson Spiess, 62, a banker waiting for a delayed train to Long Beach, scoffed at Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s planned vacation. \u201cI\u2019m going to Italy,\u201d he mimicked. \u201cYou can all telecommute.\u201dBroken ticket machines, unforgiving conductors and rising fares still irk riders, Mr. Spiess said, even as new cars and better equipment have lifted the railroad out of its worst days.While the fatal derailment in December on the Hudson line of the Metro-North Railroad has made some Long Island commuters feel comparatively lucky, the thin film of sweat covering Mr. Spiess\u2019s forehead in the perpetually steamy Penn Station was one sign that some problems remained to be solved.\u201cPrices keep going up,\u201d he said, \u201cand service gets worse.\u201dBut riders this week reserved their most strident judgments for the transit workers threatening to strike. Dan Macari, 55, a worker in technology sales, who was standing in a packed train to Ronkonkoma, called his relationship with the railroad \u201csubservient.\u201dRiders already had to endure overcrowded trains, foul smells from flimsy-doored bathrooms and views of trash-strewn rail yards, he said. Now the railroad threatened to renege on its most basic promise. Mr. Macari blamed greedy unions composed of workers who, he said, do little more than push buttons in air-conditioned cars.Mr. Macari\u2019s father belonged to a butchers\u2019 union. That has not engendered sympathy for workers who, Mr. Macari said, were lavishly paid and make no health care contributions. \u201cThis idea of unions protecting abused workers has faded out of our culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t fight my boss for money. I don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s a need for this.\u201dSome riders planned to weather the strike, if it happens, by taking a few extra vacation days at home. Others had spent the day struggling with new software that would allow them to plug into work networks from home.Commuters at the Freeport station on Tuesday evening got a preview of service disruption as a conductor on an eastbound train announced that a police investigation farther out on the line would halt travel. Freeport would be the last stop. Harried riders swarmed out of the train and onto the platform.\u201cI am disgusted,\u201d said Geanna Pesquiera, 42, a Bellmore resident who was rushing down the stairs with her 5-year-old son. \u201cThey expect us to be understanding. What about them being understanding to us?\u201dThe inconvenience of getting off a train two stops early would be dwarfed by a strike, she said. Ms. Pesquiera, a cancer survivor and a single mother of four children, depends on the train for medical appointments, stops at a church to pick up food, and trips to Central Park.Ms. Pesquiera, who is currently unemployed, said she was reluctant to look for work with a major disruption looming.\u201cI would be afraid to start working,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot depend on the train. I have so much anxiety over this.\u201dSimilar fears have prompted some veterans of the railroad to grudgingly embrace their boxy steel chariots as the specter of a standstill hovers. In the fourth car from the front of the 5:22 train to Ronkonkoma, regulars have their own rhythm and unofficial seating chart.Ms. Citron, the travel agent, always chooses a last-row seat to keep people from bumping the arm brace that she wears for nerve damage. Mark Negron, 44, a technology worker, mostly cares about a quick exit. He stands to the left of the train door, poised to dash out as soon as it begins to slide open.Fights sometimes break out over crammed space, said Kathryn Calemmo, 26, an executive assistant at Coach who was traveling to Riverhead. But if a strike forces riders to fight for spots on alternative transit methods, she said, they might become unglued. \u201cThey\u2019re going to battle over whose job is more important, over who gets seats on the shuttles,\u201d she said.A few minutes later, sitting beneath a small sign blinking \u201cToilet Is Out of Service\u201d as the train screeched into Ronkonkoma, Richard Giron, 45, fretted over the loss of a routine that bookends his days. Extolling the cushioned green-and-blue seats that carry him home to his children, he staved off gloom by muttering a small prayer: \u201cI thank God for this railroad.\u201dRuth Bashinsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Europe May Gain the Edge for Investors", "Date": "2014-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFundamentallyAT first glance, the case for investing in Europe isn\u2019t all that compelling. After suffering through the longest recession in a generation, Europe\u2019s economy is barely treading water. Growth is so sluggish there, in fact, that the European Central Bank has resorted to imposing negative interest rates on certain bank deposits in the hope of spurring business activity. Yet many market strategists say Europe is attractive, especially if you compare it with the United States. Europe\u2019s economy may not be in great shape, but it\u2019s improving: While the United States economy has already been expanding for five years, Europe is only a year into its recovery. Then there is monetary policy: In the United States, the Federal Reserve is gradually removing stimulus from the economy, while the European Central Bank is becoming even more aggressive in trying to jump-start growth. And though the price-to-earnings ratio for European stocks has risen since 2012 \u2014 to 18 from around 12, based on five years of averaged, or \u201cnormalized\u201d profits \u2014 valuations on domestic stocks have climbed even more. At the end of the second quarter, European stocks traded at a 23 percent discount to domestic shares, compared with their historical average discount of 12 percent. And that\u2019s after the average European equity fund gained 1.4 percent in the second quarter and 27.8 percent over the past year, according to Morningstar.What\u2019s more, the corporate earnings picture in Europe may not be as bleak as was feared. After suffering earnings declines from 2011 through 2013, companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s Europe 350 stock index are expected to show a rebound of 10.2 percent, on average, this year. That compares favorably with the growth rate of 7.8 percent expected for United States companies. And while corporate profits and margins in the United States are at record highs, European earnings are still around 40 percent lower than they were before the global financial crisis \u2014 so there\u2019s room to grow, Mr. Ramsey said.When you put these factors together, he added, \u201cthat tells a pretty good story.\u201dThe five largest holdings in his fund \u2014 which was up more than 6.5 percent for the second quarter, beating 96 percent of its peers \u2014 are all based in Europe. Topping that list are two big pharmaceutical companies: Shire, based in Ireland, and Novartis, in Switzerland.That is significant because many European sovereign bonds are paying much less. The yield on Spain\u2019s 10-year government bonds, for instance, fell from as high as 7.5 percent in 2012 to just 2.66 percent on June 30. In Portugal, yields tumbled to 3.65 percent from more than 10 percent.And as investors have raced into European debt, including that of countries like Italy and Portugal that still face many fiscal challenges, bond prices have lifted and yields have fallen. Mr. Walsh pointed out that something similar is occurring among equities. In the utilities sector \u2014 the only segment of the European market where corporate earnings are still sliding \u2014 share prices have risen 27 percent over the 12 months through June. Why? Because it is among the highest-yielding sectors of the market, a fact that has attracted income-seeking equity investors. \u201cThis is clearly not about growth,\u201d he said.So, he said, \u201cinvestors need to be buying businesses with resilient demand for their services and products in a flat economy.\u201dThis list includes multinational corporations that are headquartered on the Continent but that generate their sales globally. Among the top holdings in Harding Loevner International Equity are multinationals that generate much of their revenue in the Americas and Asia, such as Nestl\u00e9, based in Switzerland, and the brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, based in Belgium. Mr. Kaiser added that there was another reason that multinationals look attractive. In the depths of the European debt crisis around three years ago, many investors turned to these global brands as a way to maintain exposure to Europe without requiring strong European sales. As a result, valuations soared for companies like the spirits maker Diageo and the consumer giant Unilever. But as investors have switched gears recently to go after income investments, such as utility stocks, valuations for these multinationals have become relatively attractive again, Mr. Kaiser said.Investors can hedge their European growth bets with smaller companies as well, analysts say. The firm, however, does own shares of companies like LPKF Laser & Electronics, which is based in Germany. LPKF laser cutting devices are used in making smartphones and other high-tech products. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing strong industrial capital expenditures in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is a German company that gets a lot of its sales in Asia.\u201dAs with the broad European market, smaller companies in the region have seen their valuations rise recently as the market has lifted. But Mr. Goyal said that because some of these smaller companies weren\u2019t followed regularly by research analysts, there was greater opportunity to find mispricing.\u201cOur portfolio has more exposure to domestic Europe than the benchmark,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not because we sat down with a macroeconomic outlook. It\u2019s just that as we looked around at the opportunity set among good-quality businesses, better opportunities and better valuations were found among European focused firms.\u201d For instance, in the media sector T. Rowe Price counts among its holdings JCDecaux, which is based in France and specializes in billboards and other outdoor ads. Mr. Hartford conceded that \u201cbarely a day goes by without some headline of an investigation or accusation of wrongdoing\u201d against European banks. But he said negative headlines had driven market prices low enough that they no longer reflected the long-term potential of some of these companies. For instance, he said, investors may be overlooking the growth potential of the wealth management businesses of the Swiss banks Credit Suisse and UBS.He cautions investors not to become too euphoric, though. \u201cIf the rising tide raised a lot of boats,\u201d he said, \u201cand you\u2019re looking for those ones that have been left behind, you have to ask yourself if it was left behind for a good reason.\u201d Paul J.

{"Headline": "A Drop in the Long-Term Unemployed", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE long-term unemployment rate, which soared in 2009 to heights not seen since the Great Depression, is finally declining rapidly. The proportion of the work force that has been unemployed for at least 27 weeks has fallen to 1.98 percent, less than half the record high of 4.4 percent reached in 2010.As a result, for the first time in five years, less than a third of all unemployed workers have been out of work for at least six months. In the first six months of 2014, that figure dropped at the fastest rate in more than half a century.\u201cThe improvement in the labor market is reaching the long-term unemployed,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cThey are benefiting from the modest but measurable improvement in the labor market.\u201dAnd yet the level of long-term unemployment remains high by historical standards. During the double-dip recessions of the early 1980s, the overall unemployment rate peaked at 10.8 percent, well above the 10 percent peak in the recent recession. And now, more than six years after the recession began, the overall unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is significantly lower than at a comparable point after the 1980s downturns began. But the long-term unemployment rate remains much higher than it was at this point in the earlier cycle.The problem of long-term unemployment has not been limited to only certain kinds of workers. \u201cIt is not just the problem of people who don\u2019t have any skills and can\u2019t find work,\u201d said Katharine G. Abraham, a former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics who now is a professor at the University of Maryland.The bureau, which collects the statistics through its monthly survey of households, produces detailed figures for various groups each month but does not estimate what they would be when adjusted for seasonal factors. The lower two sets of charts show 12-month averages, ending in the month shown, for each group. The higher set of charts shows seasonally adjusted figures for the entire work force and therefore reflects changes in conditions more rapidly.As might be expected, the long-term unemployment rate is lower for those with the most education. But over the most recent 12 months, about 37 percent of unemployed workers with advanced degrees had been out of work for more than six months \u2014 a figure that was almost identical with every other level of education except one. Only 32 percent of unemployed high school dropouts had been unemployed for that long.Similarly, there seems to be little difference among age groups, with the exception of the youngest workers, aged 16 to 24. They have a higher long-term unemployment rate, but a smaller percentage of young unemployed workers have been jobless for an extended period.But race does appear to make a difference. Whites are far less likely to face long-term unemployment than blacks, with Hispanics somewhere in between. Even after falling recently, the black long-term unemployment rate of 5.1 percent over the last 12 months is considerably higher than the 3.4 percent peak rate for whites, reached in 2010.Advertisement"}

Minnesota has mandated sharp reductions in energy use in every new state-financed building for more than a decade, and in renovated buildings for more than five years.Today, Minnesota gets more of its power from wind than all but four other states, and the amount of coal burned at power plants has dropped by more than a third from its 2003 peak. And while electricity consumption per person has been slowly falling nationwide for the last five years, Minnesota\u2019s decline is steeper than the average.The Obama administration\u2019s proposal would reduce power plants\u2019 carbon pollution 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Minnesota set similar nonbinding goals for its entire economy seven years ago: a 15 percent reduction by 2015, 25 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050. (Minnesota measures carbon differently; by federal standards, its reductions would most likely be greater.)The state swings some regulatory sticks in its carbon-cutting effort. Minnesota has not only set deadlines for utilities to increase the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources, but it has also required minimum shares for certain renewables like wind and solar energy. Minneapolis, which issued a hefty clean energy blueprint in February, is using its utility franchise negotiations to bargain for further carbon-cutting measures.But it dangles carrots, too. Voracious power consumers like iron ore mines, for example, can sidestep a regulatory mandate by showing a commitment to reducing electricity use. And the state jump-starts green energy efforts by striking deals with utilities: This year, the state and its private utilities agreed to jolt the slow-growing electric-automobile market by offering discount recharging rates.\u201cWe\u2019re going to push the utilities harder than they want to be pushed, but we want them to make money while they\u2019re doing it,\u201d said State Senator John Marty, chairman of the environment and energy committee. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think it serves us well if we force-feed them.\u201dUtilities must produce 27.5 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025. And they must wring enough waste out of their service areas \u2014 for instance, by helping customers insulate buildings or install efficient lighting \u2014 to reduce electricity sales every year by the equivalent of 1.5 percent of their revenues.Some economic sectors like housing and farming so far have failed to meet the carbon reduction targets. Not so the power industry. \u201cThe utilities are on track to meet both the renewable energy standard and those emission reduction targets,\u201d said Frank L. Kohlasch, the environmental analysis manager at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Some utilities intend to beat the 2025 goal handily, he said.The same is true of the 1.5 percent efficiency mandate, said Sheldon Strom, the president of the nonprofit Center for Energy and Environment, an adviser on energy issues.In 2012, the Legislature considered eliminating the efficiency standard. \u201cThe utilities showed up at the Legislature and said, \u2018It\u2019s the lowest cost resource, best thing for our customers, we think it\u2019s great,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIt surprised a lot of our elected officials.\u201dMinnesota has enjoyed some lucky breaks, notably a fleeting bipartisan moment in 2007 when the Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty proposed far-reaching energy overhauls \u2014 including the renewable energy and carbon-emissions standards \u2014 that legislators in both parties readily voted into law.But one crucial factor, many agree, is that regulators have given utilities flexibility to reduce their emissions. One result is that many major power companies have embraced and even profited from the standards \u2014 and kept rates low.Minnesota has long allowed utilities to sidestep onerous rate hearings related to pollution-cutting measures if they can show the projects are cost-effective. That alone has helped utilities convert two coal-fired power plants to natural gas and upgrade pollution controls on several others, state officials say.And while the state oversees the utilities\u2019 renewable energy and carbon-reduction goals, the market largely chooses how they are met.Some of the winners are shockers.When Minnesota\u2019s largest power producer, Xcel Energy, needed a standby electricity source for peak periods of power consumption, the state asked an administrative law judge to evaluate the bids. Four companies competed, mostly offering to build natural gas-fired generators.The winner, chosen in January, was a pioneering project to generate 100 megawatts of power from about 20 solar arrays across the state all near substations that funnel power directly to customers. A gas-fired plant would have relied on high-voltage lines that are often congested, and where electricity dissipates with distance.A 30 percent federal tax credit given to solar-energy projects provided a crucial edge. But plummeting solar panel costs also helped make a once-unthinkable project competitive, said Blake Nixon, the president of Geronimo Energy, the Minnesota company that will build the arrays.\u201cTwo years ago, people blinked and looked up, and costs for the primary component in the system, solar panels, had dropped 75 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the overall cost dropped 50 percent.\u201dThen there is wind, which has bested the competition.In the mid-1990s, regulators required Xcel to provide a modicum of wind-based power in exchange for concessions on storing nuclear waste. \u201cXcel had to pay premium for wind power, but that put in place a premium for wind producers,\u201d said State Representative Melissa Hortman, chairwoman of the Minnesota House Committee on Energy Policy. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened now is that the wind industry has become competitive.\u201dIn fact, state officials say the renewable energy requirements have created an industry that builds, erects and services turbines and their transmission lines throughout the state\u2019s blustery west. Cheap steel and more efficient turbines have made wind the low-cost power source here. On a single day in February 2013, wind turbines supplied nearly one-third of the power sent to Xcel customers in the Upper Midwest. On average, the utility gets 13 percent of its power from wind \u2014 the same as from natural gas.\u201cWe\u2019re adding 750 megawatts of wind in the next couple of years, and we\u2019re getting that for a price that\u2019s below the competing alternatives,\u201d said Frank Prager, the vice president for environmental policy at Xcel Energy.Bill Grant, the deputy commissioner of Minnesota\u2019s Commerce Department, said he believed that the federal tax credit for wind-energy projects was increasingly irrelevant. \u201cMy hunch is, given prices right now, we\u2019d be building wind with or without the subsidy,\u201d he said.Today, energy consumption is growing more slowly than Minnesota\u2019s robust economy, and greenhouse-gas emissions have basically been level since 2000. And some legislators have begun dreaming big. Last year, the Legislature approved another clean-energy measure: a study of the prospects for making Minnesota\u2019s economy carbon-free, from the power-hungry wheat and sugar beet fields in the west to Minneapolis-St. Paul\u2019s car-clogged freeways in the east.\u201cThere was some rolling of eyes,\u201d said Mr. Marty, the measure\u2019s sponsor, \u201cbut it passed. The states that are going to have the best economies are the ones that are planning ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Scorns Sanctions; Ukraine Army Forges On", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA senior Ukrainian official, Valeriy Chaly, said on Wednesday that his country welcomed the expanded sanctions, while Russian officials condemned and belittled them, saying they would prompt Russia to strengthen its economy but would just make a sour diplomatic atmosphere worse.Mr. Chaly, the deputy chief of Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration, told reporters in Kiev that his government would not scale back its offensive against the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. He said troops had already freed 60 cities and towns and more than one million residents from rebel control.The White House issued a joint statement Wednesday with the leaders of six other major industrialized nations condemning Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, and calling on Moscow to change course or risk further penalties beyond the new round of sanctions. The statement, on behalf of the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission, expressed \u201cgrave concern about Russia\u2019s continued actions to undermine Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.\u201dEarlier in the day, observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe tried to get to the crash site but were turned back by reports of clashes and gunfire along the route. And a mission of Dutch police officers and experts said that after being similarly blocked on Monday and Tuesday, they would not attempt the journey on Wednesday.Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, the head of a Dutch recovery mission, said he did not \u201cexpect the security situation to improve enough over the next few days\u201d to visit the crash site.The mission has been in Donetsk, the nearby provincial capital, since Sunday.The government of Belarus, a neighboring country on good terms with both Kiev and Moscow, said on Wednesday that President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine had asked it to host talks among Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe over access to the crash site and other issues, Reuters reported. The office of President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus said that \u201call interested parties\u201d were invited, the news agency reported, but it was not clear whether the separatists would be represented or when the talks would convene.Andriy Lysenko, the spokesman for the Ukrainian government\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, said the main obstacle to reaching and securing the wreckage of the plane was rebel resistance. \u201cAt the crash site of the Boeing 777, the terrorists have made new fighting positions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have amassed their heavy artillery, and they mined the approaches to this territory. This made impossible the work of international experts who began trying to carry out their duties and establish the reasons for the crash.\u201dRussia, however, said Ukraine and the United States were fueling the violence in the area. \u201cIt\u2019s not Russia but the Kiev regime and its overseas sponsors who are to blame for the growing number of victims among the civilian population of the eastern regions,\u201d the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.It said the expanded sanctions announced on Tuesday would make peace harder to achieve. Imposing them, it said, can only result in \u201cfurther aggravation of Russian-American relations and the creation of an extremely unfavorable background in international affairs, where collaboration between our countries often plays a decisive role.\u201dDmitri O. Rogozin, the Russian deputy prime minister in charge of the military industry, suggested that the United States had imposed new restrictions on arms and technology sales to Russia out of fear of its growing might. He said on Twitter that the measures were \u201ca sign that Russian military shipbuilding is becoming a problem for the enemies of Russia.\u201dBut Ukrainian leaders saw in the sanctions announcement a new unity and resolve in the West to rein in Russia. \u201cWhat even a month or a month and a half ago was considered impossible has become a reality,\u201d Mr. Chaly said. \u201cWe hope by joint action of the international community, we will be able to convince our neighbor to stop the aggression against us.\u201dAs the possible effects of the new sanctions were being discussed, the European Union\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0placed three people close to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, on a sanctions list. The names included Arkady Rotenberg, described in the sanctions as a \u201clongtime acquaintance of President Putin and his former judo sparring partner.\u201dThe union also named Nikolai Shamalov, another longtime acquaintance of Mr. Putin\u2019s and the second-largest shareholder of Bank Rossiya, and Yuri Kovalchuk, also a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Putin\u2019s and a co-founder of Ozero Dacha, a \u201ccooperative society bringing together an influential group of individuals around President Putin.\u201dFor the Russian business community and political analysts, the expanded sanctions are a blow to Russia\u2019s economic prospects and a worrying sign that the country is becoming increasingly isolated.Some of the affected companies issued statements playing down the impact. VTB, a major Russian bank in which the government has a majority stake, said the new restrictions on its access to European financial markets would \u201cnot affect the bank\u2019s work, nor its credit rating,\u201d and had not been imposed because of anything the bank had done. \u201cWe consider this decision purely politically motivated, unjust, contradictory to the law and reciprocally harmful for the economy,\u201d the bank said.Investors bid down the value of the ruble by 0.26 percent against the dollar on Wednesday.Opposition voices in Russia said the economy would nonetheless pay a price for what they called Mr. Putin\u2019s misguided policy in destabilizing Ukraine.\u201cI was asked whether sanctions will stop Putin,\u201d Boris Y. Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cMy answer is no, they won\u2019t,\u201d he wrote, suggesting that sanctions might even fuel Mr. Putin\u2019s zeal to punish Ukraine for trying to leave Russia\u2019s orbit. \u201cOnly the Russian people can stop him, when they ultimately understand that the crazy man cornered and impoverished them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t happen right away. The withdrawal sickness and hangover will be long and painful.\u201dAndrew Roth reported from Kiev, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.

{"Headline": "Stronger Sanctions on Russia, at Last", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe United States followed suit shortly with measures meant to match the Europeans\u2019 and further added a Russian shipbuilding firm to the list of companies banned from doing business with Americans. These punitive and carefully orchestrated actions go considerably beyond any previous sanctions. They are designed to exact a heavy price from President Vladimir Putin, and deservedly so. Russia\u2019s behavior since the downing of a Malaysian jetliner with the loss of 298 lives has been a string of lies and a sharp escalation of direct involvement in the Ukrainian fray. Economic sanctions are a flawed and double-edged weapon, but, short of armed force, they are the only tools at the disposal of the West to make President Putin and his revanchist-ruling clique understand that breaking the rules of international behavior carries a cost, and, further, that there can be no business-as-usual when Russia carries out armed aggression against a sovereign state while enabling proxies in eastern Ukraine who shoot down an unarmed passenger plane.Europe\u2019s readiness to strengthen its earlier response \u2014 which has consisted mainly of restrictions on individual Russians \u2014 and to join the United States in striking at the Russian economy shows that Europe\u2019s leaders have now grasped the magnitude of Mr. Putin\u2019s threat. It shows also a commendable willingness to confront that threat despite the difficulty of coordinated action by 28 European Union members, Europe\u2019s heavy dependence on Russian natural gas, and the potential cost in lost jobs and contracts. This change of view makes all the more troubling France\u2019s continued determination to deliver at least one of the two Mistral-class warships it is building for Russia for 1.2 billion euros, or about $1.6 billion. The Mistral is not heavily armed, but it is a serious military asset as a forward command post and helicopter carrier. It is, in short, a formidable weapon, and the very idea that France is building two for Mr. Putin at this time is deeply troubling. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and other French officials have reacted angrily to American and British calls for the deal to be suspended. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has been especially sharply assailed in France for criticizing the French while keeping Britain\u2019s doors open to Russian oligarchs who park a lot of their loot in London. Certainly Britain cannot be exempt from making sacrifices in any future round of sanctions; nor Germany, with its extensive exports to Russia, nor any other European Union member. But financial sacrifice is one thing; arming Russia is another. That is what the French should focus on at this juncture, not the supposed slights of their allies.At this point, it appears likely that France will go ahead with the delivery of the first Mistral, the Vladivostok, in October. But Mr. Hollande has left open the possibility of at least delaying the second one, which is due for delivery late next year. One warship less may not hurt Mr. Putin as much as economic measures that shrink his economy and hurt his cronies, but a decision by France to suspend the deal would encourage other European countries to accept whatever sacrifices future sanctions might entail. It would also make a powerful statement about Western resolve not to appease Mr. Putin \u2014 and about French honor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a Soaring Stock Market Is Wasted on the Young", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiming Is EverythingThe news media typically covers stock markets using one exceedingly simple frame: Market goes up, good! Market goes down, bad!And this much is true: If you\u2019re in a stage of life when you are pulling money out of the market, like a retiree living off accumulated savings, a higher stock market is indeed great news. But some simple experiments with four hypothetical people show why that calculus is a lot more complicated for younger people. The key lesson: The dramatic runup in the American stock market over the last five years is actually bad news for many young adults who are just embarking on saving for retirement.When you invest in some broad index of the stock market, such as any of numerous vehicles that let you buy into the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stocks, you are in effect buying a claim on the future profits of all major listed companies. When the stock market goes up, you have to pay more for that future stream of profits; when it goes down, you are paying less.But not for our first hypothetical saver, Plutocrat Pete. Pete has a rich uncle who gives him $300,000 when he turns 30, which he earmarks for savings and won\u2019t touch until he\u2019s 60. Now consider three scenarios. In one, the stock market returns precisely 7 percent a year each of the 30 years. In the second, the market returns 50 percent a year for the first five years, and then zero return for the ensuing 25 years. And the third scenario is the reverse, returning zero for 25 years and then 50 percent a year for the last five years.These possibilities each have the same compound annual growth rate over the 30-year period. So Pete is in equally good shape no matter which one materializes. In all three of those scenarios, when Pete turns 60, his original $300,000 from his uncle has turned into $2.28 million.Most of us, alas, aren\u2019t Plutocrat Pete. Most of us have to save for retirement ourselves, not with one giant chunk of cash we obtain when we\u2019re young but by squirreling a little away each year.Most of us, in other words, are more like Steady Eddie, who puts $10,000 a year in his retirement account starting when he turns 30, and stops at 60. In other words, the total amount he invests is the same as the $300,000 that Pete had, except Eddie saves it over time rather than having the money upfront.In Steady Eddie\u2019s case, the stock market returns 7 percent each year. It works out fine for Eddie. With steady contributions and steady returns, the $300,000 he puts in over 30 years has turned to $1.01 million by the time he is looking to spend it. Not bad!But he\u2019s not doing nearly as well as Lucky Laura. She puts the same $10,000 a year into her retirement account, but the pattern of returns over her career just happens to be backloaded \u2014 it is the scenario described above of zero return for 25 years followed by five years of 50 percent returns.As a result, by the time those big returns are occurring, Laura has built a great stockpile of savings. So in the end, she does nearly as well as Plutocrat Pete did. Her $300,000 invested has turned into $2.01 million. Nice!But what if the reverse had happened, with all of the returns frontloaded into the first five years, followed by 25 years of zero returns? Alas, that is the world that Unlucky Umberto encountered. And even though he saved just as diligently as Eddie and Laura, he suffered because of bad timing.While Umberto might have been thrilled with the returns in his first few years of investing, they came at a time when he had very little invested. Because of lower (actually zero) future returns, he lost out, big-time.Umberto ended up with only $448,200 in his retirement account after 30 years, fully 79 percent less than Lucky Laura, even though they both socked away the same $10,000 a year.While these are all radically simplified examples, there is a real chance that current young adults are facing a situation a bit like Unlucky Umberto\u2019s. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has returned 175 percent since March 9, 2009, just over five years.Part, and perhaps most, of that rally has been driven by rising confidence in the economy, and to the degree that higher stock market prices have coincided with a recovering economy and better job market, that\u2019s of course good news. After all, in order to save for retirement, a young adult first needs to have a job.We can\u2019t all be Plutocrat Pete or Lucky Laura. Today\u2019s younger adults need to continue to save for the future, but they should cross their fingers that they\u2019re not actually Unlucky Umberto.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "LeBron and Melo Have Nothing on Eric Cantor", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Fellow Americans\u201cYou know, people are hurting,\u201d Eric Cantor admitted last month, shortly after his humiliating defeat in a Virginia Republican primary. But Cantor, it went without saying, was not one of them. While LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony shopped their talents around the N.B.A. this summer, Cantor was preparing for his own free agency. Fortunately for the former House majority leader, one truth remains self-evident in Washington: No matter how soundly you\u2019ve been walloped by voters, \u201copportunities in the private sector\u201d await.Cantor is the latest example of Washington\u2019s upward-failing, golden-parachuted, everybody-wins calculus. Even if he got his clock cleaned by an unknown economics professor, he remains \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 a five-tool Washington prospect. During his seven terms in Congress, Cantor became one of the most prodigious fund-raisers in the Republican Party; he performed numerous public services for politicians and captains of industry; he developed close ties to the banking and financial-service industries, his most generous campaign contributors; he is a lawyer; his wife, Diana, is a former vice president at Goldman Sachs. So it\u2019s hardly a surprise that Cantor still wants to \u201cfind ways that I can be influential\u201d and \u201ccontinue that drive for solutions\u201d \u2014 albeit, this time, with a seven-figure salary. \u201cWhat seemed really bad at the time,\u201d Cantor continued to Jonathan Karl on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d \u201cmay turn out to be really good.\u201dWhen Karl asked Cantor about his next move, it was only to be expected that he wasn\u2019t closing any doors, revolving or otherwise. Here is a translation of Cantor\u2019s multilayered responses to Karl\u2019s relatively straightforward question: \u201cWould you rule out becoming a lobbyist?\u201dTranslation: I am definitely not ruling that out.Translation: I\u2019m waiting for your call, Goldman.Translation: The clock is ticking, folks.The Cantor sweepstakes has become a source of fascination within the backslapping carousel of the capital. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of private-sector friends he has done favors for,\u201d says Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia who now works for Deloitte & Touche. \u201cI think it would be easy for him to become Eric Cantor Inc. and make a few million dollars a year.\u201d After all, Cantor, whose net worth is already listed between $4.4 million and $14.3 million, will soon be unburdened by pesky House ethics and disclosures and restrictions. Given his contacts and pedigree, he could one day eclipse the Tauzin Line, which is named for the former Louisiana congressman Billy Tauzin, who made $11.6 million as a pharmaceutical lobbyist in 2010. Even if he follows the more modest route of Dick Gephardt, the former House majority leader, he\u2019ll still do O.K. Gephardt, who played a convincing working-class hero during his two Democratic presidential campaigns, now runs a consulting firm that made $4.8 million in lobbying income alone last year.There was a time, it\u2019s worth remembering, when outgoing public officials would return to their farms, stores, law firms, medical practices or whatever quaint things the founders envisioned our citizen leaders doing after their public lives ended. In the 1970s, Davis worked for two Nebraska senators, Carl Curtis and Roman Hruska, each of whom wound up living out his days in the Cornhusker State. \u201cYou did not have the lobbying class that you have today,\u201d Davis told me. In 1974, according to The Atlantic, 3 percent of retiring members of Congress became lobbyists. Now half of all senators and 42 percent of representatives enter the field. And those numbers don\u2019t include our former leaders who call themselves \u201cpolicy advisers,\u201d consultants or strategists. (\u201cUnregistered lobbyists\u201d is how they are known, winkingly, around town.) Or the fact that more than half the members of Congress \u2014 who tend to be well educated, well raised and well married to begin with \u2014 are already millionaires.What\u2019s notable is how naturally D.C. commentators have accepted the \u201cmonetization\u201d of Cantor\u2019s \u201ccontribution.\u201d In an article in CQ Roll Call, Julian Ha, a headhunter at Heidrick & Struggles, urged Cantor\u2019s staff members to \u201ccall in the chits they\u2019ve been accumulating and cash them in.\u201d In a National Journal article headlined \u201cEric Cantor\u2019s Loss Could Be the Best Thing That\u2019s Happened to Him,\u201d one former Republican Capitol Hill aide and current lobbyist earnestly wondered, \u201cThe question is how rich does Eric Cantor want to be.\u201d Chris Jones, an executive-search specialist, guessed that the answer was very, very rich. He suggested to Time that Cantor would move to New York and join a major investment bank. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be a standard lobbyist at a law firm,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll go big. . . . I think he\u2019s a major power player.\u201dTherein lies the uncomfortable reality of our gilded capital. Cantor\u2019s loss was widely attributed to his growing \u201cout of touch\u201d with his Richmond-area constituents \u2014 he had become too steeped in Washington\u2019s machinations, too cuddled up with Wall Street, too beholden to the entrenched insider\u2019s world. An oft-quoted factoid, courtesy of Open Secrets, is that Cantor\u2019s campaign spent more money at Bobby Van\u2019s steakhouses ($124,177) than David Brat, his opponent, did on his entire campaign ($122,792). Yet those qualities are precisely what now make him such a prized recruit in his next career. As Brat presciently noted on the campaign trail, \u201cAll the investment banks up in New York and Washington, whatever. . . . Instead of going to jail, where\u2019d they go? They went on to Eric\u2019s Rolodex.\u201dCantor is, in some sense, living proof of the thing that most voters loathe about Washington: the notion that membership in its political class guarantees a win-for-life lottery ticket. Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent claim that she and her husband were \u201cdead broke\u201d after leaving the White House was preposterous not because it was technically untrue (it was true, at least on paper, for a brief while) but because it ignored the reality that being a public servant has become a prerequisite to being a multimillionaire. While the Cantor sweepstakes continues, countless smaller parlor games ensue. For instance, will Jay Carney, who stepped down as White House press secretary in May, take his talents to MSNBC, like his predecessor Robert Gibbs? Will he start his own consulting shop (also like Gibbs) or simply embark on a regimen of paid lectures? Gibbs, after all, made about $2 million in speech fees in his first year and a half outside the White House.LeBron Cantor, meanwhile, is weighing his options and having discussions about his future. (Just not with me; he declined to comment for this article.) Needless to say, he\u2019s probably not talking to anyone about returning to Richmond to start a law firm, say, or volunteer at an orphanage. When I mentioned that notion to a lobbyist friend, he burst out laughing. If that happens, he said, he would buy me dinner at Bobby Van\u2019s.Mark Leibovich, author of \u201cThis Town,\u201d is the magazine\u2019s chief national correspondent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modest Euro Zone Growth Fails to Dent Unemployment Rate", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The unemployment rate in the euro zone remained close to a high in May, according to official data released on Tuesday, a reminder that despite modest growth, the recession has never ended for millions of Europeans.The jobless rate in the 18-nation euro zone in May was 11.6 percent, unchanged from the revised rate for April, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency.The rate for April was revised downward from a previously reported 11.7 percent. Economists had expected the rate in May to again be 11.7 percent.\u201cToday\u2019s labor market data underline the very tentative pace of recovery in the euro zone,\u201d Tom Rogers, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said in an email. He said he expected the jobless rate to remain above 11 percent until 2016.For all 28 nations in the European Union, the unemployment rate in May declined slightly to 10.3 percent from a revised 10.4 percent in April, meaning 25.2 million people were without work in May. Of those, 18.6 million were in the euro zone.Joblessness in the euro area has fallen since peaking last year at 12 percent, but it remains above rates of less than 8 percent that prevailed before the financial crisis began in 2008. Growth remains slow or nonexistent in much of the euro zone, and companies have not been willing to hire.Economists warn that such persistent mass unemployment will cause long-term damage that goes beyond the immediate human cost.\u201cIf you\u2019re out of work for a long time, it\u2019s not just that your skills become obsolete,\u201d Moritz Kraemer, managing director and chief rating officer for sovereign ratings at Standard & Poor\u2019s, told a conference in Paris on Tuesday, adding that workers become disillusioned and find it ever harder to return to work.That is bad news for European economies, he said, because the region \u2014 which faces a demographic problem in the aging of its citizenry \u2014 needs to keep people working to fund its social welfare support system.The problem is particularly serious where young people are concerned, Mr. Kraemer added. \u201cIf you have youth unemployment of 50 percent, as you do in some places,\u201d he said, \u201cthese are the people we need to pay our pensions.\u201dThere continued to be huge disparities among countries within the euro zone. There was nearly full employment in Austria, with a 4.7 percent jobless rate, and Germany, with 5.1 percent. But unemployment in Spain remained unchanged at 25.1 percent in May compared with April, despite signs that the Spanish economy was improving.In Italy, unemployment rose to 12.6 percent in May from 12.5 percent in April.Greece had the highest jobless rate in the euro zone, with unemployment at 26.8 percent in March, the most recent month for which figures were reported.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "All Looks Calm Ahead of Jobs Report", "Date": "2014-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks closed at new highs Wednesday following news that business hiring surged in June, adding to evidence that the economy is picking up momentum.ADP, a payroll processor, said businesses added 281,000 jobs in June, up from 179,000 in May. The figure suggests the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, due out Thursday, could also show a significant gain from May. Separate reports showed that manufacturing expanded in China and the United States.\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of what\u2019s been an extended recovery, but there\u2019s still a lot of room to go,\u201d said Ed Hyland, a global investment specialist at JPMorgan Private Bank. \u201cWe believe that for the stock market as well.\u201dThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 1.30 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,974.62. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 20.17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,976.24. Both the S.&P. 500 and the Dow are at nominal highs. The Nasdaq composite fell a point, less than 0.1 percent, to 4,457.73. Constellation Brands, which makes Corona and Negra Modelo beer, was one of the day\u2019s biggest gainers. The stock jumped $2.07, or 2.3 percent, to $90.45 after the company said its fiscal first-quarter net income soared.Delta Air Lines was the day\u2019s biggest decliner. The stock dropped $2.07, or 5.1 percent, to $38.24 after the company said that growth in a key revenue figure slowed in June. Delta\u2019s stock is still up 38 percent this year.Government bond prices fell, with the 10-year Treasury note slipping 17/32 to 98 29/32. The yield rose to 2.63 percent, from 2.57 percent on Tuesday. It has climbed from 2.45 percent at the end of May as signs have emerged that the economy is strengthening.The rising bond yields also left their mark on the stock market. Utilities fell the most of the 10 sectors that make up the S.&P. 500, declining almost 2 percent. Investors had bought utility stocks at the start of the year as bond yields dropped because they pay rich dividends.Should the economy continue to improve and bond yields rise, investors will most likely start to take money from the bond market and invest in stocks, said Jeff Knight, head of global asset allocation at Columbia Management, an asset manager. \u201cThose sectors that tend to be thought of in yield and income terms, like utilities or telecoms, would be laggards,\u201d Mr. Knight said.Stocks that should benefit most from an improving economy, such as industrials, should do well. Factories in the United States already show signs of being busy. The Commerce Department reported that orders fell 0.5 percent, pulled down by falling demand for military and transportation equipment. That followed increases of 0.8 percent in April, 1.5 percent in March and 1.7 percent in February.Excluding military hardware, factory orders rose 0.2 percent in May from April. Orders for transportation equipment fell 2.9 percent. Orders for computers and electronic equipment fell 2 percent.Among other stocks making big moves on Wednesday, Rackspace Hosting, a provider of data-storage and other services, jumped $2.13, or 6.3 percent, to $35.88 on reports that the company wants to go private, allowing it to focus on its business without worrying about public accountability.Monsanto shares rose $2.23, or 1.8 percent, to $126.53 after the company said late Tuesday that it had entered into an \u201caccelerated share repurchase\u201d agreement with JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.

{"Headline": "Paying Employees to Stay, Not to Go", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCONCORD, N.H. \u2014 Ben Nawn, a sophomore at the University of New Hampshire, says his friends who work at McDonald\u2019s are envious of what he earns working for the Boloco burrito restaurant here.While they make $7.25 an hour, the federal minimum wage, Mr. Nawn receives $9 an hour, which Boloco sets as the floor at its chain of 22 restaurants, most of them in New England.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty high,\u201d said Mr. Nawn, who hopes to work in sports broadcasting someday. \u201c$9 is a good base, and the benefits are great.\u201dMr. Nawn works at one of the handful of restaurant chains that deliberately pay well above the federal minimum wage. In-N-Out Burger, the chain based in California, pays all its employees at least $10.50 an hour, while Shake Shack, the trendy, lines-out-the-door burger emporium, has minimum pay of $9.50. Moo Cluck Moo, a fledgling company with two hamburger joints in Michigan, starts everyone at $15.These companies\u2019 founders were intent on paying their workers more than the going rate partly because they wanted to do the right thing, they said, and partly because they thought this would help their companies thrive long term.\u201cThe No. 1 reason we pay our team well above the minimum wage is because we believe that if we take care of the team, they will take care of our customers,\u201d said Randy Garutti, the chief executive of Shake Shack.The nation\u2019s fast-food restaurants, which employ many of the country\u2019s low-wage workers, are at the center of the debate over low pay and raising the federal minimum wage \u2014 fueled by protests demanding that fast-food chains establish a $15 wage floor. McDonald\u2019s was pilloried last year for a hotline that advised employees how to seek food stamps and public assistance for heating and medical expenses.During the lunchtime rush at the Boloco here, four workers showed impressive teamwork in stuffing beef, chicken, salsa and other ingredients rapid-fire into burrito after burrito. Scott Newman, the restaurant\u2019s manager, said that Boloco\u2019s above-average pay enabled him to pick from among many talented job applicants, adding, \u201cWhen you teach talented individuals, once they get it, they\u2019ll be a rock star for you.\u201dComplaining of low profit margins that generally accompany inexpensive menu items, most fast-food restaurants try to keep wages down \u2014 the median hourly wage for fast-food workers nationwide is $8.83, compared with $11.50 at Boloco and $10.70 at Shake Shack.Some competitors assert that these fast-food companies are also influenced by regional economics. They note that many of the companies that pay more are based in high-wage, high-cost-of-living states, like Massachusetts and California, that often have minimum wages well above the federal law. California, where In-N-Out is based, has a $9 statewide minimum wage, while Washington State, home of Seattle-based Starbucks, has the nation\u2019s highest state minimum wage, $9.32 an hour.John Pepper, Boloco\u2019s co-founder, said the strategy for his Boston-based company evolved after it initially adopted a low-wage approach.\u201cIn the company\u2019s early years,\u201d he said, \u201cour goal, like much of the industry, was to pay as little as you can get away with and have people still show up and be reasonably productive.\u201dBut while watching employees mop floors and work late into the night, he realized that for his company to be as great as he hoped, it needed to treat its workers better.\u201cWe were talking about building a culture in which we want our team members to take care of our customers,\u201d Mr. Pepper said. \u201cBut we asked, \u2018What\u2019s in it for them?\u2019 Honestly, very little.\u201dSo in 2002, when the minimum wage was $5.15 an hour, Boloco raised its minimum pay to $8. It also began subsidizing commuting costs, providing English classes to immigrant employees and contributing up to 4 percent of an employee\u2019s pay toward a 401(k).\u201cIf we really wanted our people to care about our culture and care about our customers, we had to show that we cared about them,\u201d Mr. Pepper said. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about building a business that\u2019s successful, but our employees can\u2019t go home and pay their bills, to me that success is a farce.\u201dWhen the company raised its minimum pay to $8, \u201cthat was an immediate hit to the P.& L.,\u201d Mr. Pepper acknowledged, referring to the company\u2019s profit and loss statement.He said his privately held company, unlike some fast-food chains, did not sense an urgency to achieve a 20 percent profit margin per restaurant.Zeynep Ton, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, said many companies did not pay their employees well because they had a short-term focus on maximizing profits.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to create a business where you pay your employees well and have low prices and generate great profits,\u201d said Ms. Ton, author of \u201cThe Good Jobs Strategy.\u201d \u201cYou have to get a lot of things right. You have to have continuous improvement and an excellent mind-set. Achieving excellence is always harder than achieving mediocrity.\u201dFast-food industry officials have long contended that raising the minimum wage would result in fewer jobs and higher prices.Scott DeFife, an executive vice president at the National Restaurant Association, said it was inappropriate to compare restaurants like Boloco and Shake Shack with chains like McDonald\u2019s and Subway.\u201cThe price point and convenience factor are more appropriately compared to casual table restaurants that have wait staff,\u201d Mr. DeFife said.But prices at Boloco and In-N-Out are largely similar to those at Chipotle or McDonald\u2019s. The prices at Shake Shack are higher, but consumers flock to it because it is known for its premium hamburgers.Mr. DeFife noted that restaurants paying higher wages tended to be in places where consumers were willing to pay more for their meals.In addition to its higher-than-average hourly wage, Shake Shack, which is part of the restaurant impresario Danny Meyer\u2019s Union Square Hospitality Group, offers a 401(k) match and a monthly bonus based on store sales. Those working more than 30 hours a week qualify for health coverage.Ruben Mojica recently moved to Winter Park, Fla., to be a manager at the new Shake Shack there. He started as a line chef at a Shake Shack in Manhattan in 2008, working two other jobs to make ends meet. After two months at Shake Shack, he was earning enough to devote his time to just the one job.\u201cThe company has developed me, given me training and the opportunity to achieve more \u2014 and paid me better than any other restaurant chain would,\u201d he said.Because of the health insurance the company offers, Mr. Mojica said, he and his wife were able to start a family much sooner than he had imagined.At the McDonald\u2019s shareholders meeting in May, Don Thompson, its chief executive, defended the company\u2019s compensation policies, saying many managers there started as hourly workers.\u201cWe continue to believe that we pay fair and competitive wages,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cWe provide job opportunities and training for those entering the work force.\u201d\u201cWe are trying to be a really great employer,\u201d he added.The founders of the well-paying restaurant chains often point to Costco as a model, saying that it has found a formula to thrive even though it pays its workers well. Like Costco, they have all sought a way to single themselves out \u2014 Boloco emphasizes fresh, healthy food; Shake Shack, high-quality burgers; and In-N-Out, superquick service.When Harry Moorhouse opened his first Moo Cluck Moo restaurant 15 months ago in Dearborn Heights, Mich., its minimum pay was $12 an hour. Since then, it has raised that to $15 and opened a second restaurant in Canton, Mich., with plans to open a third in October and perhaps additional restaurants in Chicago and California next year.\u201cOur people work really hard, and $15 impacts their lives in a very positive way,\u201d Mr. Moorhouse said. \u201cThe whole notion that it\u2019s all kids starting out and they don\u2019t deserve to be paid much, that\u2019s all specious. We\u2019re paying people $15 an hour so they have a living wage, so they really care about you when you come in the store.\u201dA major benefit of paying $15, he said, is \u201cwe don\u2019t have any turnover. We don\u2019t have to train people constantly.\u201d His restaurants serve upscale hamburgers, chicken sandwiches and salads, and a full meal generally costs around $1.25 more than at McDonald\u2019s.Rachel Troutman, 34, said she was thrilled to be earning $15 an hour, $600 a week, with Moo Cluck Moo. She used to earn $10 an hour as a top manager at a sit-down family restaurant.Thanks to her higher pay, Ms. Troutman, a mother of four, has replaced her 1996 Oldsmobile 88 with a more reliable 2005 Ford Taurus and has gone from renting an 850-square-foot home to buying a 1,900-square-foot house.\u201cI no longer need food stamps,\u201d she said, \u201calthough the government still helps me out with child care. I don\u2019t know how families are making it on the minimum wage. It would take two full-time minimum wage jobs to make what I make.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaving a Sport in Better Shape", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn BaseballMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 They came to their current positions 22 years ago, one as a member of the Yankees\u2019 organization, the other as the baseball commissioner. Derek Jeter was drafted in June 1992, three months before Bud Selig rose to the top of the sport\u2019s hierarchy. Now they are retiring, with just the final lines remaining for their weighty legacies.Selig\u2019s will be more complicated, of course. It is Jeter, not Selig, who was celebrated this week at his final All-Star Game. The commissioner has been inconspicuous, sitting beside his friend Hank Aaron in a suite for Monday\u2019s Home Run Derby and letting his top lieutenant, Rob Manfred, handle the on-field duties.Selig is perhaps best remembered here for the contraction threat in 2001, when Montreal and Minnesota seemed to be on the verge of elimination. The Expos eventually moved to Washington, while the Twins, after much wrangling, finally left the Metrodome for dazzling Target Field.This ballpark is a fitting a symbol of Selig\u2019s tenure. Securing it was a thorny issue that took complicated maneuvering, with mistakes and hurt feelings along the way. But the end result is something better and more sustainable than what had gone before.\u201cIt was really painful; it was really difficult,\u201d Selig said Tuesday. He was talking about his efforts to promote competitive balance, but really, it has all been a fight. Expanding the playoffs and interleague play were easy, compared to the fight for revenue sharing, the early battles with the union and the public humiliation of the steroid era.Reforming the game\u2019s economy, Selig said, stands out most to him as the cornerstone of his legacy. Getting there, alas, took the cancellation of the 1994 World Series. He is also proud of baseball\u2019s drug testing program, widely heralded as the toughest in professional sports. Again, though, it took the tainted feats of a generation before baseball got there.Ignore all the bad stuff in between, and the before-and-after images of the Selig era are striking. \u201cI think the industry\u2019s doing a lot better now, monetarily,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cI think attendance is higher than it\u2019s ever been, salaries are higher than they\u2019ve ever been, teams are making more money than they ever have, TV deals are bigger, there\u2019s more exposure, there\u2019s more parity when it comes to teams, there\u2019s expanded playoffs. So the game has grown quite a bit since I first came into it, but I think it\u2019s grown in a good way, and I think it will only continue to grow.\u201dAttendance is not at an all-time high, but it is up roughly 5,000 fans per game from 1995, when Jeter made his major league debut and the sport was reeling from its longest work stoppage. Only one current player, in fact, had played in the majors before the August 1994 strike: Alex Rodriguez, who was driven from the game this season by Selig\u2019s steroid cops.Rodriguez always wanted to be the symbol of Major League Baseball, but his greed and insecurity ruined that. It is Selig\u2019s good fortune that despite all the goons who reigned in his tenure, in the end, it is Jeter who stands tallest.The longtime Yankees shortstop is in his 20th and final season. His many milestones and career highlights are compiled here with related video, and articles and photos from the Times archive.\u201cIf you were sitting two decades ago and you said, \u2018Boy, this is a guy that I want to be the face of baseball and be what this generation will remember,\u2019 you couldn\u2019t have written a script like this,\u201d said Selig, who then compared Jeter to Aaron. \u201cHow lucky can this sport be to have the icon of this generation turn out to be Derek Jeter? It\u2019s absolutely remarkable.\u201cI told him this in front of his parents about five or seven years ago, and he had a great response. He said, \u2018Boy, I sure fooled you, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 But if he fooled me, he fooled everybody else in the world. That\u2019s how I feel about Derek Jeter. Makes it easy to be the commissioner of baseball.\u201dJeter has grown used to such praise, the same kind showered on Mariano Rivera at his final All-Star Game at Citi Field last summer. Jeter is part of the All-Star team, but also somewhat separate. He did not attend the derby Monday night, choosing family time over gawking at homers from sluggers he barely knows.Kyle Seager, a young All-Star who plays in Seattle, said that he had hoped to spend a little time with Jeter but that he was tough to find, with all the commotion around him.Brian Butterfield, a Boston coach who instructed Jeter in the minors, said he had been nervous even hitting grounders to his old prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hit him one with backspin so it eats him up,\u201d Butterfield said. \u201cI was like, \u2018C\u2019mon, c\u2019mon, center this baby, get a little topspin.\u2019\u00a0\u201dJeter said it was hard to dwell on his final moments, because the Yankees have another game to play on Friday. He allowed himself a bit of introspection when asked why people are so drawn to him.\u201cI try to be respectful to everybody I deal with, especially the players I play with, the players I play against, the fans, the media,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cI know I don\u2019t give you guys what you want a lot of times, but I still try to be respectful. But I don\u2019t sit around and think, \u2018Why does someone respect me in return?\u2019 I\u2019ve never thought about it.\u201dSelig acknowledged that he thinks a lot about his legacy these days. He turns 80 on July 30. Recent innovations, like instant replay, are imperfect but improving. A few items will be left unresolved, like better ballparks for the Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays. \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate in my career to solve most everything else that I tried to do, and I\u2019m proud of that,\u201d Selig said. \u201cBut there are some things in life that just take more time.\u201dHe leaves baseball in better shape than it was when he took over. Most of that came with great difficulty. Having Jeter as the sport\u2019s frontman was the easy part.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Good News and Gloom for Medicare, Wrapped in a Mystery", "Date": "2014-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthBut that good news came wrapped up in the usual long-term bad news: The aging of baby boomers means that Medicare\u2019s long-term finances are in trouble, even if the next decade is looking much better.This year, enrollment in the program is about 54 million people. In the year that the trustees now project that Medicare will start struggling to pay all its hospital bills, enrollment will be more than 81 million, and the number just keeps going up after that. Even if spending for each individual in the program stopped growing, Medicare would still have to cover all those new people. If spending growth held pace with inflation, Medicare\u2019s budget would look a lot like Social Security\u2019s. The Social Security trustees also came out with a report Monday: They expect that program to face insolvency in 2033.That\u2019s why the trustees note that spending for the whole Medicare program will grow at a \u201csomewhat faster pace than either aggregate workers\u2019 earnings or the economy over all,\u201d even though spending growth for individual patients is expected to be pretty low.\u201cEven with the slowdown that\u2019s happened, there are still some real challenges ahead,\u201d said Mark McClellan, the director of the health care innovation and value initiative at the Brookings Institution and the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the second Bush administration. \u201cThink about the overall economic implications.\u201dMonday\u2019s report offered two more bits of gloom for budgetary pessimists.Medicare\u2019s trustees acknowledged that the spending slowdown driving their improved forecasts was still mysterious, and that its durability couldn\u2019t be counted on. They are not alone in that view: There\u2019s a healthy debate among academics and health care policy experts about why health spending has slowed recently. \u201cNo one knows\u201d what\u2019s causing the slowdown, said Charles Blahous III, the lone Republican among the trustees, at a news conference announcing the findings.Robert Reischauer, another public trustee, agreed that scholars were \u201cmany years away\u201d from understanding the slowdown\u2019s precise causes, though he was more optimistic that the slowdown could stick.That doesn\u2019t mean the good news isn\u2019t good news. The slowdown is rare and welcome, and is taking a lot of pressure off the program and the federal budget.

A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.\u201cThe P.M.I. reading continued to improve in June, indicating that the economy has basically stabilized,\u201d Zhang Liqun, a researcher at the government\u2019s Development Research Center, said in a statement accompanying the data. \u201cVarious measures to stabilize the economy have become effective.\u201dThe measures have included lowering the reserve requirement for more banks in an attempt to increase lending, raising the scale of relending and bond financing to support smaller companies, and a further reduction in administrative fees for businesses.The P.M.I. figures are among the earliest pieces of Chinese data released each month, and the improvement will bolster market expectations that China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, after the United States, is steadying after hitting an 18-month low of 7.4 percent growth from January to March.The official survey showed a broad-based recovery in manufacturing activity in June, with nine out of the 12 subindexes pointing to improvement from the previous month.A subindex for export orders edged up to 50.3 in June from 49.3 in May.The P.M.I. report also showed new orders, a measure of both foreign and domestic demand, inched higher, to 52.8, in June from 52.3 in May, with the highest reading since October 2013.Analysts say that the official survey is geared toward larger, state-owned factories. A private survey that focuses more on small and midsize companies showed activity expanded in June for the first time in six months as new orders jumped.The final reading of that survey, the HSBC/Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index, for June rose to 50.7 from 49.4 in May, the first time since December it had risen above 50.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Conduit for Russian Gas, Tangled in Europe\u2019s Conflicts", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe port of Varna on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast was supposed to be the gateway for a major new pipeline, directly connecting Europe to Russia\u2019s vast natural gas supplies. Now the project has stalled, as Bulgaria finds itself torn between the European Union and Russia in the escalating conflict over Ukraine.In early June, European officials demanded that the Bulgarian government halt work on the pipeline, saying it breached the region\u2019s rules.Soon after, a delegation of senators, including Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin; John McCain, Republican of Arizona; and Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, met with Bulgaria\u2019s prime minister to raise concerns about the project and the influence it gives Russia. They also criticized a pipeline contract awarded to a Russian company sanctioned by the United States. At a joint news conference later, Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski announced that Bulgaria would block the pipeline, called South Stream.\u201cWhat gives Vladimir Putin his power and control is his oil and gas reserves and West and Eastern Europe\u2019s dependence on them,\u201d Senator Johnson said in an interview. \u201cWe need to break up his stranglehold on energy supplies. We need to bust up that monopoly.\u201dThe energy industry, with its interconnected web of corporate, government and economic interests, is proving a crucial pressure point in the Ukraine crisis. While sanctions by the United States and Europe have hit a few top figures in Russia\u2019s oil and gas business \u2014 and have complicated matters for multinational energy giants \u2014 Europe\u2019s dependence on Russia for gas is widely viewed as limiting the scope of the West\u2019s response.The South Stream pipeline is the biggest energy project caught in the political crossfire.Dreamed up by Gazprom and the Italian oil giant Eni in 2007, the proposed pipeline would snake about 2,400 kilometers, or roughly 1,500 miles, from southern Russia via the Black Sea to Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary and ultimately Austria. When completed, the pipeline could handle about 60 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year, enough to allow Russian exports to Europe to largely bypass Ukraine.Gazprom and Russia want to have a free hand to deal with Ukraine without a reprise of previous pricing disputes in 2006 and 2009 that left some European countries without heat in the middle of winter. But the pipeline would also consolidate Russia\u2019s position as the dominant gas supplier to Europe, blocking competing projects and potentially increasing the Kremlin\u2019s leverage in energy politics. Last year, Russia supplied about 30 percent of the gas consumed in the European Union.\u201cSouth Stream definitely improves energy security,\u201d said Massimo Di Odoardo, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an Edinburgh-based market research firm. \u201cBut it also increases dependency on Russia.\u201dEven without the backdrop of the Ukraine conflict, the pipeline has raised concerns.For one, it will not be cheap. The European segments of the pipeline are expected to cost more than 16 billion euros, or about $22 billion. Bringing the gas from the grid in Russia to the Black Sea coast is likely to require billions more.Given the high price tag, it is not clear whether the project makes economic sense. The countries where the pipeline would run are relatively small gas consumers, while big industrialized countries like Germany, France and Italy have numerous alternatives for the fuel. And Europe\u2019s overall appetite for gas has been in decline because of weak economic growth and heavy investment in renewable energy sources like solar and wind.\u201cIt is a very expensive landline to markets that may not be all that lucrative,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, a Russia specialist at Eurasia Group.But South Stream \u2014 along with another undersea pipeline already in use, Nord Stream \u2014 are integral to Russia\u2019s pipeline politics. The two pipelines would allow Russia to export natural gas to Western Europe along routes that largely bypass former Soviet republics and satellite states.This would mean that in a price dispute, such as the current one with Ukraine, Gazprom could halt supplies to some countries without risking an interruption of the flow to its big customers in the West, like Germany. Today, Ukraine or other transit states can always retaliate against a politically tinged gas cutoff by closing the taps on Russia\u2019s exports to Western Europe, with potentially devastating consequences for Russia\u2019s economy.Nord Stream, which runs undersea from Russia to northern Germany, started transporting gas in 2011 and has already sharply cut the amount of gas that comes through Ukraine. The steady flow has helped calm the markets during the current crisis.\u201cTwo pipelines are better than one, three pipelines are better than two and four pipelines are better than three,\u201d said Gerhard Roiss, chief executive of the Austrian energy company OMV, a Gazprom customer and a partner on the segment of the pipeline planned for Austria.The European Union, which has been trying with little success for years to ease its members\u2019 dependence on Russian energy imports, is raising warning flags. Complex negotiations will be required to bring South Stream into compliance with European energy market rules, but the tensions have frozen talks between Russia and the union.The Ukraine crisis \u201chas slowed down our progress on South Stream considerably,\u201d G\u00fcnther Oettinger, Europe\u2019s top energy official, said last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t just give in to the Russians every time.\u201dBulgaria, home to the first onshore piece of the South Stream project in the European Union, is a logical place for authorities to focus their ire.The country\u2019s political leaders gave their blessing to the pipeline plan. The 3.5 billion euro project, they said, would create thousands of jobs, bolster the construction industry and lead to an economic revival of the northern part of the country, one of the poorest regions in Europe. The first gas was supposed to start flowing next year.Eleven groups bid on the project, with companies from Austria, Belgium, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia and Sweden vying for the contract. On May 25, South Stream announced the winner of the Bulgarian section, a consortium led by the Russian construction company Stroytransgaz.\u201cThe consortium won it due to its offer of best conditions, including the price as well as the quality,\u201d a Stroytransgaz spokeswoman, Elizaveta Philippova, said in a emailed comment.European authorities asked the Bulgarian government to delay construction on the local segment of the pipeline. The European Union said the project did not conform to rules designed to maintain a competitive energy market, including requirements that other suppliers be allowed access to pipelines like South Stream. The union also objected to recent Bulgarian legislative efforts to exempt the offshore segments of the pipeline from these regulations.\u201cOur Russian partners know all about our legislation,\u201d said Mr. Oettinger. \u201cThey just don\u2019t accept it.\u201dThe deal also rankled American officials, since both Stroytransgaz and its principal owner, Gennady Timchenko, had been sanctioned by the United States.For years, financial analysts in Moscow have questioned whether Stroytransgaz and related entities that build pipelines for Gazprom, the state-controlled energy company, have been used to siphon money from Gazprom to company and government insiders. The company is tightly connected with the business and government elite in Moscow. The United States has identified Mr. Timchenko, who became wealthy during Russia\u2019s oil boom, as part of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle.Mr. Timchenko\u2019s involvement may stoke fears that South Stream is a vehicle for increasing Russian influence over Bulgaria and other countries along its route. Choosing a sanctioned entity may also prevent American companies from participating in the project.\u201cWe are deeply concerned with Bulgaria\u2019s recent decision to award the contract for the construction of the South Stream pipeline to Stroytransgaz,\u201d Marcie B. Ries, the American ambassador to Bulgaria, said in a statement last month. \u201cNow is not the time for business as usual with Russia.\u201dThe decision by the prime minister to stop the project has stirred dissent in his shaky coalition, with Dragomir Stoynev, the economy and energy minister, saying last month that South Stream was \u201cirreversible.\u201d A debate on the project is likely to play a significant role in the election campaign expected this year. The ruling socialist party is still solidly behind the project, while the right-leaning opposition, its top opponents, say they will tear up the contract with Stroytransgaz.\u201cThese gentlemen are in the middle of pressure from Moscow and Brussels,\u201d said Ognyan Minchev, a political analyst in Sofia, referring to the political leadership.Despite all the uncertainty, South Stream\u2019s momentum may be hard to reverse, according to industry analysts and company executives.In recent days, huge quantities of steel pipes specially forged to withstand substantial pressure arrived from Russia at the Bulgarian Black Sea port of Burgas. The pipe is slated for the segment of South Stream that will run underwater for 900 kilometers from Anapa, Russia, to Varna, Bulgaria, and that will cost more than \u20ac10 billion.\u201cSouth Stream is a moving train, and it will take a lot to stop it,\u201d said Trevor Sikorski, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London research firm.An article on Tuesday about the halting of work in Bulgaria on the South Stream pipeline, the biggest energy project caught in political crossfire over the crisis in Ukraine, misspelled the surname of the American ambassador to Bulgaria. She is Marcie B. Ries, not Reis.Andrew E. Kramer and Alexandra Odynova contributed reporting from Moscow, and Milen Enchev from Sofia, Bulgaria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corporate Medicis to the Rescue", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cOur doors are wide open for all the philanthropists and donors who want to tie their name to an Italian monument,\u201d Italy\u2019s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe have a long list, as our heritage offers endless options, from small countryside churches to the Colosseum.\u201cJust pick.\u201dThe practice of using corporate largess to finance restoration projects for public antiquities was once fairly rare here. But with the nation struggling with a stagnant economy and crushing public debt \u2014 Rome is flirting off and on with bankruptcy \u2014 politicians are now looking to private companies and international sources to help preserve Italy\u2019s cultural heritage.While private-public partnerships are common in the United States and many other countries, the government has traditionally been responsible for maintaining historical sites in Italy, and even today some historians and preservationists worry that the shift could lead to crass commercialization. Critics complain that companies have exploited cultural sites by commandeering them for elaborate dinners or the display of luxury advertisements.Indignation ran high in Florence after it was discovered that city officials had allowed Morgan Stanley to hold a dinner inside a 14th-century chapel for a rental price of $27,000. Florence\u2019s mayor doubled the rent to $54,000 after the outcry, but some argued that price was not the core issue.\u201cThere are sacred places where one can simply not hold a dinner,\u201d said Salvatore Settis, an expert in cultural heritage law and a former director of the J. Paul Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. \u201cNot even for four million euros\u201d ($5.4 million).Many preservationists were also outraged that Rome\u2019s mayor allowed the Rolling Stones to rent Circus Maximus for an outdoor concert last month.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has often spoken about the need to enlist private companies to underwrite work at sites like Pompeii, where more than $137 million in European Union funds has already been spent. In May Mr. Franceschini, the culture minister, announced a new tax deduction intended to encourage private-sector donations for the restoration and preservation of museums, archives, libraries and theaters.Few Italian politicians are more active in trying to woo private money than Ignazio Marino, who worked as an organ transplant surgeon in the United States for decades before returning to Italy and being elected mayor of Rome last year. From the balcony behind his office, Dr. Marino has one of the best views in Rome, overlooking the Forum, with the Colosseum in the distance. And like a determined salesman, he has shown the vista to visiting political leaders, tycoons and a Saudi sheik while delivering a message: Help preserve what you see.\u201cWe simply can\u2019t manage by ourselves,\u201d the mayor told a panel of diplomats from the United States, Britain and other countries whom he brought together in June to make his case. He distributed a list of Roman monuments in need of restoration and appealed for expertise and money from abroad \u2014 as much as $270 million.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a responsibility that belongs to Rome or Romans only \u2014 it belongs to mankind,\u201d he added. \u201cLarge parts of Western civilization started here.\u201dWhile private money has been used in the past to finance cultural projects \u2014 philanthropists\u2019 groups like Friends of Florence or Save Venice Inc. have footed the costs of hundreds of small restorations over the years \u2014 such efforts are dwarfed by the ones now being advocated by many of Italy\u2019s leading politicians.\u201cIn Italy, we are seeing now something that happened in the U.K. with Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, an anti-state rhetoric in favor of privatizations,\u201d said Tomaso Montanari, a professor of art history at the University of Naples who has criticized the trend. \u201cIt is very much in fashion to talk about private investments in arts restorations.\u201dAt the heart of the controversy is what private donors receive in return.Diego Della Valle, the founder of Tod\u2019s, was initially suspected of planning to harness his $34 million restoration of the Colosseum to an aggressive advertising campaign: Critics worried that the Tod\u2019s logo would festoon the scaffolding and be printed on admission tickets for the 2,000-year-old arena. Mr. Della Valle said he had no intention of exploiting his sponsorship and had donated the money out of a sense of national pride. The only visible nod to the financing ended up being a small Tod\u2019s logo on exterior signage detailing the nature of the project.Italy has no shortage of wealthy citizens, but the incentives for private philanthropy that exist in the United States were long absent here. The new tax breaks announced by the culture minister will allow donors to receive a tax credit over three years equal to 65 percent of the gift. Many of the Italian companies now making high-profile donations describe them as altruistic acts based on a love of their native culture. Last month the Salvatore Ferragamo fashion house, based in Florence, announced a donation of $817,000 to restore a wing of the Uffizi Gallery.\u201cMy father migrated to the U.S. when he was very young, and then came back to Italy and chose Florence as his city and his company\u2019s headquarters,\u201d Ferruccio Ferragamo, president of the Salvatore Ferragamo Group, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe air that my father \u2014 and we all \u2014 breathe here is inspirational. It was time for us to give back.\u201dYet one of the biggest deals may end up being brokered with the Saudi royal family, which is moving to create a special fund devoted to restoring historic sites in Rome. Dr. Marino suggested that one project might be the oft forgotten Mausoleum of Augustus, which he described as \u201can open wound in the middle of the city.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of people who thought, \u2018Oh, we cannot have rich billionaires paying with his money or her money to restore our antiquities,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cI took a completely opposite approach: \u2018Look for the money where the money is.\u2019\u00a0\u201d He added that the deal with the Saudis had not been finalized.At a news conference with the diplomats, the mayor said the Italian public needed to be reassured that their cultural heritage was being protected. He called for the creation of a foundation with foreign trustees, including art historians and academics, that would draft a restoration plan based on a list of monuments in need of work. He said the trustees could also manage the funds.\u201cI\u2019d like to get people involved from all over the planet, not just for the monetary contribution, but also for the intellectual contribution,\u201d Dr. Marino said.An article on Wednesday about Italy\u2019s growing reliance on aid from corporations and international sources to preserve national treasures referred imprecisely to the 25 million euro (about $34 million) refurbishment of the Colosseum in Rome. Part of that money has been spent on the facade, not all of it.Advertisement"}

The Palestinians elected Hamas into power, and instead of building hospitals, schools and the makings of a thriving economy, Hamas used Gaza as a launching pad for shooting rockets into Israel.After nine years, Israel has had enough and has launched an offensive to do what Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, cannot: stop Hamas once and for all. Maybe then there will be hope for peace and reconciliation. To the Editor:Your July 9 front-page report about violence in Israel and Gaza did not mention a major factor contributing to today\u2019s crisis: the seven-year blockade. The blockade is impossible to miss in any visit to Gaza.When I visited there in 2010, the first Palestinians I saw through the caged walkway from Israel were boys piling rubble onto donkey-drawn carts. Rubble has long been the only building material available to most Gazans because of Israel\u2019s restrictions on importing construction goods.I saw families sleeping on the rubble of their homes demolished by Israeli airstrikes two years before who are still unable to rebuild. The blockade has devastated life for ordinary Palestinians and emboldened extremist groups.The United States can help stop violence against Israelis and Palestinians by pressing for an immediate cease-fire and an end to the blockade. The writer is the legislative associate for Middle East policy at the Friends Committee on National Legislation. To the Editor:These same people and organizations have virtually no criticism of the thousands of rockets sent into Israel, day and night, with no advance warning. And many give short shrift to the suicide bombers who continue to blow up Israeli school buses and cafes and who kidnap and murder Israeli teenagers.Israel isn\u2019t perfect. But in a war situation where one side refuses to recognize the other\u2019s right to exist, credit should be given to a country that seeks to minimize civilian casualties rather than to groups that celebrate the slaughter of innocent people in the street.To the Editor:When Israeli children are murdered, the Arab streets are filled with celebration. The murderers are honored with statues and parks named after them, and the parents of the murderers praise their \u201cmartyrs.\u201dThe Arab educational system, communications system and even summer camp recreational system continue to spew hatred for Jews and the \u201cZionist enemy.\u201dWhen Arab children are murdered, the suspects are brought to justice under the democratic Israeli legal system. The act is condemned and the perpetrators are punished. The prime minister of Israel calls the slain boy\u2019s family to offer condolences. No celebrations.While there may be the psychological need to create the \u201ccycle of violence\u201d concept, in truth, if the Palestinians put down their weapons, there would be peace.To the Editor:The world is watching to see how the Palestinians and Israel deal with the aftermath of the horrific killings of three Jewish boys and a Palestinian youth.As expected, emotions boiled over on both sides. Now is the time for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Mahmoud Abbas to show true leadership. There can be no whitewash on either side.Perhaps both leaders can use these senseless acts as a way for them to come together and work out a lasting peace. If so, these deaths will not have been in vain. If not, this cycle of death will surely continue.To the Editor:You write, \u201cIt is the responsibility of leaders on both sides to try and calm the volatile emotions that once again threaten both peoples.\u201d Why are leaders looked to when leaders from too many countries have failed endlessly to achieve peace in the Middle East since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in the last century?Advertisement"}

The State Department report cites fewer prosecutions for trafficking violations in Malaysia in 2013 than in 2012, and no investigations, prosecutions or convictions of government employees or recruiters complicit in human trafficking. Traffickers, unethical employers and corrupt officials in Malaysia have little to risk and much to gain from exploiting trafficking victims, and they know it.For Malaysia to restore its credibility on human trafficking, it must abandon its blame-the-victim approach.

{"Headline": "A Different Aging in Place", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDomestic LivesI have a confession. I\u2019m 47 years old, and I still live at home. Sort of; I do have my own apartment. But I still live in the house I was born into, a five-story Brooklyn Heights townhouse. My mother lives there, too. She\u2019s been there longer than I have (by a few months, anyway), but I have what feels like a special status in the building. I\u2019m the only one who has lived on every floor since the building was divided into apartments in the 1950s. I was bathed in the white enamel kitchen sink of the garden apartment as a baby. I set my hair on fire blowing out the candles at my 10th birthday party on the parlor floor. I romanced my future husband with one of John Hersey\u2019s bluefish recipes and a large amount of tequila one night in the late \u201980s on the fifth floor. Ten years later, I learned of my father\u2019s death \u2014 in his sleep, one flight below me \u2014 while working on my first novel at a desk on the third floor. And for the past eight Octobers, I\u2019ve made princess, fairy, cat, bat, owl, dog, dinosaur and Ophiotaurus costumes for my daughters on the fourth floor, the top level of the duplex that my family of four now inhabits. When my parents first moved to the Heights, in 1966, the neighborhood had gotten rather down at the heels \u2014 meaning, it was affordable. There was a topless bar, the Club Wild Fyre, around the corner from the house, and several grand old hotels operating as single-room-occupancy residences. The apartment they were interested in was on the ground floor, and had a garden and nice moldings. Still, it was dark, and the children\u2019s room \u2014 for my parents were expecting their second child, me \u2014 would be tiny, hardly more than a closet with a window. They wouldn\u2019t have rented it if my mother\u2019s friend Ginger hadn\u2019t said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t take it, I will.\u201dThere\u2019s always a faint aroma to old buildings, something to do with the food the inhabitants have cooked over the years, plus the wood and plaster in the walls, and the makeup of the earth on which the foundations were laid. My building, a Greek Revival townhouse, was built in 1839. The first owner, Asa Worthington, lived there with his family and several servants for about 50 years. He owned a flour mill, and although I don\u2019t bake much, I like to think I can detect a trace of yeastiness from all the bread that must have been baked in the house in those early years. Whatever its origin, the ever-so-slightly musty scent had been brewing for 127 years by the time I came home from the hospital. My parents had planned to move back to Manhattan as soon as they could afford to. Instead, in 1973, they bought the building and combined their basement apartment and the parlor floor above to create a spacious garden duplex. They hoped to keep up with their mortgage, which was small by current standards, but a stretch for two recent art-school graduates, by renting out the top three floors. It turned out they needed a little help from family (all the apartments were rent stabilized), but they did it.When my parents first moved in, the tenants included a French couple with an infant on the parlor floor; a single cat lady on the floor above; a newlywed couple on the fourth floor; and a middle-aged audiophile and his wife on the fifth. Eventually, the French people returned to France and the audiophile retired to the country. The newlyweds raised their child and both died in middle age. The cat lady, with whom no one ever got along, finally moved away after my parents offered her money to leave. Over the years, we\u2019ve also had a book-jacket illustrator, a prominent newspaper editor, two architects and various writers, nonprofit types, lawyers and investment bankers living in the building. Even a Google mogul has passed through. As the years passed, the economy rebounded, and the neighborhood, like so many other parts of the city, regentrified. The Wild Fyre closed in the early 1990s. Some of the old hotels went condo. There was still one abandoned building on our block, but we made a project of cleaning out its front garden, which was filled with dead shrubs, used condoms and dirty syringes, and planting and watering it until someone bought and renovated the house.When my brother and I graduated from college, we both moved into apartments in the building at our parents\u2019 urging. We were normal enough kids, with thoughts of going off on our own, but they hooked us by offering steeply discounted rents. He took the third floor and I got the fifth, a sunny two-bedroom that\u2019s sweltering in the summer but has a huge living room with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves designed by the audiophile to hold his LPs. (The 12-inch shelves are just as good for dictionaries and encyclopedias, I discovered.) As a result, like our parents, we had the opportunity to explore careers in the arts. My brother got an M.F.A. in writing at Columbia, although he eventually pursued another career. I went to work at The Paris Review, a job I held for 16 years, getting a literary education. After a while, my brother went to live in another city. But somehow, with the exception of a couple of years when I lived in Germany, I never left the house. The rent was too good. So was the location. And then I moved into a better apartment: the one on the third floor with the big deck. I started growing tomatoes and imagining children of my own to feed them to.I\u2019ve watched the city evolve through the lens of this building and its tenants. And it, in turn, has sheltered my own development, from childhood to adulthood, marriage and motherhood, from aspiring writer to novelist. In fact, I\u2019m so much a creature of it that I set my entire second novel, \u201cWhen the World Was Young,\u201d in it \u2014 or a building very much like it. I embellished the fictional building with features like a dumbwaiter, borrowed from another house in the neighborhood where I\u2019ve spent time, and anchored it in details from my building\u2019s life, like the Nazi flag that hung in the window just next door in 1939 \u2014 a troubling piece of history recorded in a New York City tax photograph on file at the Municipal Archives, a copy of which hangs in my mother\u2019s kitchen.As for my mother, she is still the landlord. But my responsibilities, as a tenant, are broader than most: I handle late-night exploding sewer lines and do computer troubleshooting.My mother, who is now a grande dame of the neighborhood, lives downstairs and is our backup babysitter extraordinaire. When my husband forgot his car keys the other morning, I was able to leave the children at home with her and deliver him from the traffic cops before they towed the car away. I keep an eye on her in the same way. When her blood sugar plummeted last winter, I found her unconscious on my routine evening visit to her apartment, but I was there in time to call an ambulance. Why do I stay? For so many reasons, but mostly because I have the privilege of doing so. Do I ever long for different pastures? Yes, but when I think it out, I realize I\u2019m as well situated as I\u2019m ever likely to get. After all, I could never afford the rent in this area if I weren\u2019t born into it.

American industry, converted almost overnight from civilian to wartime production, produced 1,556 naval ships; 5,777 merchant ships; 88,410 jeeps; 2,383,311 trucks; 6.5 million rifles and 40 billion bullets between 1940 and 1945. Perhaps most impressive were the 299,293 airplanes that rolled off the assembly lines. Whether the air war was ultimately decisive remains a matter of historical debate, but Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Hitler all believed these planes were essential to victory because they could bring the fight to their opponents by destroying their industrial capabilities, pulverizing their military hardware and terrorizing their populations into submission. In A. J. Baime\u2019s fast-paced book, \u201cThe Arsenal of Democracy,\u201d the Ford Motor Company and its production of the B-24 Liberator heavy bomber take center stage. To be sure, this was one of many planes produced for the war, and Ford was neither the only car company to manufacture planes nor the largest military contractor. But as Baime points out, \u201cAmericans believed that no single Detroit industrialist was contributing more to the war effort than Henry Ford.\u201d Mass-producing a heavy bomber during the war makes for a dramatic story, as American business had to completely reorganize itself to take on what Roosevelt\u2019s mobilization czar, William Knudsen, called \u201cthe greatest production problem of any country in modern times.\u201d Baime, an editor at large at Playboy, covers everything from engineering challenges to the huge social dislocations the war caused in order to highlight the multiple problems faced by Ford. At the heart of the story is the clash between the increasingly senile, deeply anti-Semitic, Roosevelt-hating senior Ford and his terminally ill son, Edsel, a fight that Baime suggests significantly jeopardized the company\u2019s war efforts. The story certainly entertains, though it occasionally shades into melodrama. Baime recounts the uncomfortable history of Ford\u2019s business dealings with the Nazis, but it stretches credibility to claim, as he does, that in 1938 Hitler\u2019s expansionist intentions were unknown, or that faced with the decision to either work with the Nazis or risk losing access to German markets, \u201cthere was no right choice.\u201d Perhaps this argument would be more plausible if Baime had given us a financial perspective. But somewhat surprisingly for a book that looks at industry, Baime does not write much about finance. As Secretary of War Henry Stimson said, \u201cIf you are going to try to go to war . . . in a capitalist country, you have got to let business make money out of the process or business won\u2019t work.\u201d While noting that Ford grew considerably after the war started, Baime doesn\u2019t tell us how wartime contracts affected the company\u2019s bottom line, or how that factored into its corporate decisions. And while Baime does note that the Roosevelt administration made calls for harnessing the nation\u2019s \u201cwhole industrial strength,\u201d he does not reconcile this with the fact that the country remained the least mobilized of all participants, and in fact scaled down the rate and pace of its mobilization lest it inflict too much damage on the civilian economy. In times of economic austerity, and particularly in periods when the international environment is fraught, the types of weapons that governments purchase and the importance of the relationships between businessmen and public officials grow in significance. The book\u2019s intent is not to be useful to contemporary policy debates but to tell a good story. However, ignoring some of the more challenging complexities of its subject makes \u201cThe Arsenal of Democracy\u201d less rewarding than it might have been.

The difference is \u201cshadow unemployment,\u201d to borrow a term Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, used at her June press conference.The government counted 3.8 percent of the adult population as unemployed last month. (The official unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is measured as a share of the labor force rather than a share of the working-age population.) By this measure, unemployment is getting close to pre-recession levels. In December 2007, 3.0 percent of the adult population was unemployed.But hold the celebrations. Another 3 percent of the adult population reported that they are working part-time because they cannot find full-time jobs. This figure remains far above the December 2007 level of about 1.8 percent. In fact, part-time jobs accounted for two-thirds of all new jobs in June. Some economists expect employers to draw on this pool of partially employed workers as the economy continues to expand. Others, however, argue that at least some of these workers will not be able to find full-time work because of their shortcomings or because the economy is shifting toward part-time jobs.Finally, we have the people who are not counted as unemployed because they are not actively seeking work. We don\u2019t know how many of these people might return to the labor market as the economy improves. One simple measure: In June, the government reported that 2.7 percent of American adults said they were not actively looking for work, but they would still like a job now. About 2 percent of adults were in that category in December 2007.Advertisement"}

The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has called for exempting investment spending from deficit figures as he tries to re-energize France\u2019s economy.Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, struck a more reassuring tone about the euro zone\u2019s second-largest economy, amid rising concern that France may be the new \u201csick man of Europe.\u201d\u201cFrance is a huge economy in Europe, with a large industrial base and innovation and research,\u201d Mr. Sapin said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we can be sick, or at least sick for a long time.

{"Headline": "Left Coast Rising", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe states, Justice Brandeis famously pointed out, are the laboratories of democracy. And it\u2019s still true. For example, one reason we knew or should have known that Obamacare was workable was the post-2006 success of Romneycare in Massachusetts. More recently, Kansas went all-in on supply-side economics, slashing taxes on the affluent in the belief that this would spark a huge boom; the boom didn\u2019t happen, but the budget deficit exploded, offering an object lesson to those willing to learn from experience.And there\u2019s an even bigger if less drastic experiment under way in the opposite direction. California has long suffered from political paralysis, with budget rules that allowed an increasingly extreme Republican minority to hamstring a Democratic majority; when the state\u2019s housing bubble burst, it plunged into fiscal crisis. In 2012, however, Democratic dominance finally became strong enough to overcome the paralysis, and Gov. Jerry Brown was able to push through a modestly liberal agenda of higher taxes, spending increases and a rise in the minimum wage. California also moved enthusiastically to implement Obamacare.I guess we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore. (Sorry, I couldn\u2019t help myself.)What has actually happened? There is, I\u2019m sorry to say, no sign of the promised catastrophe.If tax increases are causing a major flight of jobs from California, you can\u2019t see it in the job numbers. Employment is up 3.6 percent in the past 18 months, compared with a national average of 2.8 percent; at this point, California\u2019s share of national employment, which was hit hard by the bursting of the state\u2019s enormous housing bubble, is back to pre-recession levels.Has there been any soul-searching among the prophets of California doom, asking why they were so wrong? Not that I\u2019m aware of. Instead, I\u2019ve been seeing many attempts to devalue the good news from California by pointing out that the state\u2019s job growth still lags that of Texas, which is true, and claiming that this difference is driven by differential tax rates, which isn\u2019t.So what do we learn from the California comeback? Mainly, that you should take anti-government propaganda with large helpings of salt. Tax increases aren\u2019t economic suicide; sometimes they\u2019re a useful way to pay for things we need. Government programs, like Obamacare, can work if the people running them want them to work, and if they aren\u2019t sabotaged from the right. In other words, California\u2019s success is a demonstration that the extremist ideology still dominating much of American politics is nonsense. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Promises of Hope Tarnished by Lack of Change", "Date": "2014-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From GuadalajaraGUADALAJARA, Mexico \u2014 The excitement that flooded this city\u2019s Liberation Plaza two years ago, when Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto announced his presidential candidacy amid mariachi bands, young hipsters and swooning women, has not just dissipated. For many, it has curdled.Even as he garners international praise for pushing through reforms in energy, education, telecommunications and taxes, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s public approval rating in Mexico has fallen to 37 percent from 54 percent, below that of any Mexican president in recent memory. Many former supporters now say they wonder: Were we deceived?\u201cAt first, it looked like there was a lot of change \u2014 \u2018look at all these new laws,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Martin Moreno, 60, a shoe-shiner at the plaza who voted for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \u201cBut then what came out of it all made us open our eyes. The reality is that for the middle class and below, life is worse.\u201d\u201cThe reform process is not designed to have an immediate impact,\u201d said Luis Videgaray, Mexico\u2019s finance minister. \u201cWhat we are trying to do with these reforms of historic proportions is to change the structure that has slowed down the country\u2019s growth for many years.\u201dAnd yet, here in Jalisco State, famed for its centrality in Mexican culture \u2014 the birthplace of tequila and mariachis, and a bellwether for national politics \u2014 the gap between the government\u2019s message and the public\u2019s assessment of its performance has become a canyon. The question is: Does that reflect a failure of government to deliver on its promises, or a sign of maturity for Mexico\u2019s young democracy?Many veteran observers of Mexican society say that voters here have become savvier and more demanding \u2014 far less willing to embrace gloss without true transparency, or to trust presidential platitudes until they see positive results.\u201cPeople are deeply enraged but not just based on erratic emotions, but rather in a pensive and thoughtful way,\u201d said Laura Esquivel, the Mexican novelist who wrote \u201cLike Water for Chocolate.\u201d \u201cPeople are slowly waking up from a fairy tale.\u201d As it turns out, Mexico\u2019s long and complicated relationship with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, has not been as easy to recast as the president and his advisers thought.Young Mexicans in particular often describe themselves as disillusioned with how much of the old way of doing things \u2014 heavy on information control, light on transparency \u2014 remains in force.\u201cI get frustrated a lot,\u201d said one 32-year-old PRI government official working on economic development in the Guadalajara area. Requesting anonymity to protect his job, he argued that the federal government under Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto still governs with past PRI values, favoring connections over good ideas, ignoring corruption, and generally just acting clueless when it comes to younger Mexicans\u2019 expectation of direct communication and decisions based on data, not back-room deals.\u201cThey don\u2019t understand there\u2019s a new way of doing things,\u201d the official said.The result, many argue, can be seen in the underwhelming economy. Even as Mexico draws in record levels of foreign investment, especially in the automobile sector, overall growth has been about as strong as a toddler kicking a deflated soccer ball. The economy grew in the first quarter of 2014 reached only 1.1 percent, far below the administration\u2019s initial projections of 3.9 percent growth for the year.Mr. Videgaray said Mexicans should begin to see tangible economic benefits over the next two to five years. \u201cThese are changes designed to transform the future of Mexico,\u201d he said.On the poor eastern periphery of Guadalajara, Teresa Mozqueda, 33, one of many local Pe\u00f1a Nieto voters with regrets, said that for her husband\u2019s vegetable cart, \u201csales are sometimes lower, sometimes the same, but it\u2019s never better.\u201d At the same time, she added, \u201ceverything we buy is more expensive.\u201dAsked how she feels about the PRI now, she laughed, as if forced to talk about an ex-husband. \u201cI was deceived,\u201d she said.Downtown, Mr. Moreno, the shoe-shiner, said the reforms could make it worse. Tall, mustachioed and a daily reader of five newspapers, he said he fears the new fiscal law intended to broaden tax collection, which he said would require him to open a bank account and have taxes taken out \u201ceven if I earn nothing.\u201dExperts say that is a misinterpretation; that enrollment may not be forced, and that there are incentive programs to offset the costs associated with trying to bring Mexico\u2019s large informal economy into compliance with laws and benefits.But what is increasingly clear in Mexico is that the reforms \u2014 however shiny and new \u2014 will be respected or scorned based on how they are applied and enforced. Many parents and education scholars are already criticizing the government for enacting a new education law, aiming to increase accountability and standards, only to let entire states refuse to comply.Others in business, from peddlers to executives, look at plans to allow private investment in Pemex, the state oil company, and recall the disappointments that came with the privatization of toll roads. They were supposed to be affordable and world-class; instead, many now say, they are expensive and often inferior.Especially among the high-tech crowd here in Guadalajara, there are also concerns that the new telecommunications law, which is supposed to increase competition and reduce fees, amounts to a privacy grab by government, granting officials greater power to monitor communications and shut down websites or limit Internet access traffic in certain circumstances. \u201cThe new reforms are necessary, yes, but what we worry about is: who is in charge,\u201d said Adri\u00e1n Campos, 34, a communication specialist for a new technology company here. \u201cEveryone is always just looking to benefit themselves.\u201dSuch pessimism has a rich history in Mexico, and political analysts argue that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto can banish the intense skepticism only with bold competence \u2014 a dramatic shift in how government functions, with tangible improvements in the justice system, the economy and transparency.And the rest of Mexico may need to change too.\u201cWe need to learn to be more optimistic and demanding,\u201d said Miguel Herrera, the coach of Mexico\u2019s national soccer team, adding that the country could learn from its team, which entered the World Cup poised to disappoint, only to overachieve. \u201cThey took us for dead,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we worked hard to convince them of the opposite, and to prove to them that we were killing ourselves in the field to reach the objective and the results we all wanted. I think us Mexicans, we should all be doing the same thing in every aspect of our lives.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazilians Grumble and Take Stock After Crushing World Cup Loss", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 As Brazil tried to absorb the shock of its 7-1 loss to Germany in the World Cup, the rout offered a vivid reminder of how the fortunes of the national soccer team can mirror how Brazilians view their society even as other traumas recede into history. The hosting of the World Cup has been politicized from the moment FIFA, the scandal-tarred organization that oversees global soccer, awarded the tournament to Brazil in 2007. Back then, the economy was booming and the president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, viewed the Cup as an opportunity to celebrate Brazil\u2019s achievements on the global stage.Now the economy is sluggish, in its fourth consecutive year of slow growth. While the feat of lifting millions out of poverty over the past decade remains intact, Mr. Lula da Silva\u2019s handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, has grappled with widespread protests over political corruption and spending on lavish stadiums.Just last week, a survey suggested that Brazilians were softening in their views of the Cup, buoyed by a series of stunning matches and a lack of major problems in the hosting of the tournament itself. Antigovernment protests had dwindled substantially, even though discontent continued to smolder over the public financing of stadiums when other large-scale projects remained unfinished. The effect of Tuesday\u2019s devastating loss on the presidential elections later this year may be hard to gauge. Ms. Rousseff, while less popular than at the start of her term, remains well ahead of her rivals in polls. Projects conceived in boom times stand abandoned, visible symbols of waste and the country\u2019s crippling bureaucracy.In 1998, Brazil\u2019s national team also stunned the country, losing in the final, but the president then, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, won re-election.Roberto da Matta, 77, a well-known anthropologist, said, \u201cSoccer has long served as Brazil\u2019s symbol of excellence, an area where Brazil could surpass any country in Europe, any country in the world.\u201d \u201cMy hope is that we\u2019re finally at the end of a cycle,\u201d Mr. da Matta continued, \u201chelping us pay more attention to problems in the country and less to how soccer affects our perception in the world.\u201d Brazilians explain what it feels like to lose really, really badly.\u201cSince I drank a little, I even asked a friend, \u2018Can this really be happening?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he told reporters. \u201cCan it be true?\u201dBrazil, of course, is a far different country from the Brazil at the time of the Maracanazo. Incomes have risen, illiteracy has diminished, democracy is more broadly entrenched and industrial companies have become giants. Outside Petrobras, the national oil company based here, Celso Lacerda, 35, an employee, said: \u201cThe game was kind of shocking, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much else to say. If this had happened in previous eras, there would be a bigger impact on Brazil.\u201dOthers tried putting the defeat into perspective in a country where the national soccer players have traditionally been treated with a reverence far beyond most people\u2019s grasp. \u201cPersonal accomplishments are so hard to come by here, that people are drawn to where they find collective success,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Oliveira Tavares, an accountant in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cIt\u2019s not how things should be, but I understand it.\u201dStill, for many Brazilians, the humiliation of losing in such a way, especially after waiting 64 years to host the tournament after the fiasco of 1950, continued to sting.\u201cThis feels like a punch in the stomach,\u201d said Gabriel Emiliano, 30, the owner of a company renting video equipment in Bras\u00edlia. \u201cI\u2019m very sad, and very shocked, and also ashamed.\u201dMariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, Lucy Jordan from Bras\u00edlia, and Seth Kugel from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Obama, Go Big on Immigration", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialHis powers are limited, of course. Only Congress can give immigration the long-term, comprehensive overhaul it so badly needs. A bipartisan bill passed by the Senate a year ago \u2014 and strangled in the House \u2014 was the best hope for that. But Mr. Obama should do his utmost, within the law, to limit the damage done by an obsolete, unjust system that is deporting the wrong people, stifling businesses, damaging families and hurting the economy. It starts with giving millions of immigrants permission to stay, to work and to live without fear. Mr. Obama needs to scale back the deportation machinery, which he greatly expanded. His decision two years ago to halt deportations of young immigrants called Dreamers was a good first step. Now he should protect Dreamers\u2019 parents, and, if possible, parents of citizen children. His emphasis should be on protecting families and those with strong ties to this country, and on freeing up resources to fight human traffickers, drug smugglers, violent gangs and other serious criminals. He should end programs that recklessly delegate immigration enforcement to local police. He should make it easier for family members of citizens to seek green cards without having to leave the country for three or 10 years. Through common-sense fixes to onerous visa restrictions, wise use of prosecutorial discretion and new programs to allow groups of immigrants to apply to stay and work legally, Mr. Obama should move the system away from its deportation fixation, and closer toward balance. Mr. Obama wants to shift resources away from the interior to the border, where tens of thousands of children have recently been detained after fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. He hopes to stem the influx through swifter deportations, but his most urgent priority should be giving these children lawyers and caregivers. While many will probably be sent back, many others will likely qualify for humanitarian protection. Republicans will howl over Mr. Obama\u2019s solo actions. Let them. Let the party pay a heavy price among Latino and Asian voters for failing to tame its nativist wing, whose only idea for immigration is a fantasy of an airtight border and mass expulsions. Nobody was even being released in Murrieta. But the mayor urged residents to complain, and in a pageant of ugliness, dozens took action: They waved flags, screamed \u201cU.S.A.!\u201d and turned three buses back. As the border crisis plays out, public support for legalization will be tested. But Mr. Obama can ease fears if he acts on the belief that millions who are here are a benefit to the country and deserve a chance to stay. Through cynical abdication, Republicans wasted a precious chance to fix immigration for the 21st century. That game is over. The president has moved on. It\u2019s about time. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transit Cards to Replace Cash on Kenyan Minibuses Are a Hard Sell", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNairobi JournalNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 On the gritty streets of this capital city, the battle for Kenya\u2019s future may come down to Hitler versus Google.Hitler is a matatu, electric raspberry in color, one of the thousands of minibuses that serve as Nairobi\u2019s subway system. Its owner says he meant no offense in naming his bus after a genocidal maniac. He simply liked what he called \u201cthose funny, funny names.\u201d Hitler has been misbehaving lately, refusing to adopt a new technology that could revolutionize one of East Africa\u2019s most lawless and lucrative cash-based industries.Google, which some could argue also has a funny, funny name, has been pushing the new technology: a little green transit card that will replace cash payments and track every transaction on the minibuses, making it much harder to bribe police officers and much easier for the government to capture millions of dollars in taxes. But despite Google\u2019s substantial investment and the Kenyan government\u2019s deadline for all matatus to go cashless by July 1, Hitler is the norm, not the exception.Google\u2019s little green card has incited strong resistance, with the vast majority of Kenya\u2019s matatus still dealing in their preferred currency \u2014 grubby bills \u2014 as they zoom around Nairobi\u2019s streets stuffed with passengers, flitting in and out of traffic like a bunch of fleas on methamphetamines.\u201cPeople thought Google was crazy to go into Kenya\u2019s transport sector,\u201d said Dorothy Ooko, an executive at Google\u2019s 40-person office in Nairobi. \u201cWhen we first got involved, nobody wanted to touch this.\u201dGoogle is not giving up, and the struggle to modernize Kenya\u2019s unruly matatu trade illustrates the challenges of superimposing cutting edge technology on some of the poorest countries in the world. Across the continent, the analog Africa of old is racing, at variable speeds, toward a digital future. Rwanda has invested heavily in high-speed Internet even though most Rwandans are still peasants swinging muddy hoes. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, women sell $500 iPhones from little kiosks lit by stubby candles.\u201cWhat we are trying to do,\u201d said Manoah Esipisu, a government spokesman, with a sad shake of the head, \u201cis to minimize human contact.\u201dThe matatu industry may be the best example. Millions of commuters use matatus everyday. Glassy-eyed conductors shanghai hapless passengers from the curb into shuddering minibuses that zigzag through lines of cars, sometimes even jumping up on the sidewalk. The matatus are loud in every way: blaring music, crazy paint jobs, wild names (Gangsta, Psycho, I Feel Nothing). But they also kill. Because owners typically demand from the crews a flat fee for using their buses for the day, the drivers and conductors squeeze every cent they can from passengers by stuffing them in as tightly as possible and getting them to their destination at deadly speed. A single accident can kill a dozen or more people. If a cop stops a matatu for speeding or overloading, no problem. The driver just shoves a fistful of Kenyan shillings out the window.The other day, Hitler\u2019s driver, a short, chatty guy named Nicholas, was breaking about five laws at once: talking on his phone, running red lights, pumping Rihanna way too loud, not wearing a seatbelt, and cutting off other cars. Nicholas preferred that his last name not be revealed, lest he face consequences for his merciless style of dispatching with traffic.The idea to use technology to tackle the matatu problem started on a rainy day a couple of years ago when some executives at Google were staring out their plate-glass windows at the matatus stacked up on Uhuru Highway, watching passengers pay double for a ride (matatus always jack up fares on rainy days). The Google executives said, What about a transit card?With engineers from a Google lab in Zurich, the Kenya team helped design a special plastic card that uses near field communication technology, so you do not even have to swipe the card, just rub or tap it. Google made a simple app for matatu conductors to use through an Android phone. The Kenyatta government was thrilled. The plan was to digitally monitor all matatu activity, eliminate robberies and take away the incentive to drive recklessly. (Without cash, the matatu drivers and conductors would be switched to regular monthly paychecks.) The government was eager to rake in taxes from an industry with an estimated $2 billion turnover, though since most of it is done in worn-out bills, no one really knows.\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Ms. Ooko said. \u201cWe get users.\u201dBut the matatu owners did not want to be Google users.\u201cKenya is a cash-based economy!\u201d yelled one conductor the other day, when asked if his bus accepted BebaPay cards. A few dozen bus lines said they used the cards, but most matatu conductors scornfully waved it away. Other companies have unveiled competitor cards, but even fewer commuters seemed to be using those. The government, in a bow to the power of the matatu cartels, has extended the deadline for several months, saying it needs to rethink implementation.Hitler\u2019s owner, Joram Kamau, is yet to be convinced. As for the name of his bus, he had a vague awareness of the atrocities orchestrated by Adolf Hitler but never heard of the Holocaust. It was not something they focused on in Kenyan schools.\u201cWhen I was little,\u201d Mr. Kamau said, \u201cI fought a lot. I was really tough. The kids in my neighborhood called me Hitler.\u201dSo when he bought his first matatu two years ago, he named it after himself. \u201cHitler\u201d is painted on the windshield in 7-inch-high letters and stitched into every seat.Hitler may go cashless, one day.\u201cI just got the paperwork,\u201d Mr. Kamau said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I\u2019m open to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aid Elusive, Crimea Farms Face Hurdles", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySIMFEROPOL, Crimea \u2014 Sergei V. Tur, a significant landowner, scowled beneath his desert camouflage cap as he watched a hulking combine chew through one of his golden barley fields, reaping part of what he predicts will be the best harvest in Crimea in three years.The weather may be cooperating, but since the Russian annexation of the Black Sea peninsula in March, the political crisis has disrupted virtually every other aspect of farming \u2014 from irrigation to credit to exports.\u201cOn a scale of one to five, we are at negative three,\u201d said Mr. Tur, the head of the Association of Farmers and Landowners of Crimea, with 300 members among the largest 1,700 farms.Despite Russian promises of support immediately after the annexation, help from Moscow has been spotty at best.\u201cIt would seem reasonable to get some help from the Russian government, but I don\u2019t see that the government is helping,\u201d said Mr. Tur. Recently he was called to a meeting with the deputy minister of agriculture, who praised the government\u2019s pledge to fund 50 percent of a variety of new farm programs, Mr. Tur said.\u201cWhere are we supposed to get the other 50 percent that we cannot pay ourselves?\u201d asked Mr. Tur. Given that the sector generated $660 million in output last year, just behind tourism and manufacturing, it deserves more help, he said.The problems are legion. Buyers from giant international grain trading firms like Cargill and Dreyfus avoid Crimea because of a Western boycott of its products.Ukraine closed the spigot for the main irrigation canal in April, starving the peninsula of essential water. No rice was cultivated, corn planted for feed was sharply curtailed and even widespread crops like wheat and barley were stunted, but generous rains helped bring them back.With Ukrainian banks now shuttered and Russian ones barely established, farmers have struggled to get credit for essentials like seed and fertilizer.And farmers and agricultural companies hoping to break into the Russian market have suddenly found themselves caught in a transportation labyrinth. Ferry service, the only link to mainland Russia, can involve a 15-hour wait on the best days. It often takes two or three days to clear the backlog when storms shut the service across the Kerch Strait, with vehicles backing up for miles.Agriculture is not the only economic sector in disarray. Tourism, the foundation of the economy, is down by more than one-third this year, government officials and tour operators said, despite the Kremlin\u2019s encouraging Crimean vacations, sometimes with reduced airfares.Many bank customers, not just farmers, face trouble getting money because few banks are operating. Hotels and restaurants generally refuse credit cards. Major banks fear Western sanctions for working in Crimea, so mostly only small regional Russian banks are opening.The legal system remains in limbo, since there is scant expertise in Russian law. Cellphone and wireless signals yo-yo up and down as the technology shifts from Ukrainian to Russian providers.Some Crimeans complain that they face repeated unpleasant surprises. Prices for basics like milk have doubled. Where television cable service once provided a full array of international and Ukrainian satellite channels, it now shows only Russian channels.The first concrete signs of blowback on the Russian economy are also emerging. The estimated cost of developing Crimea through 2020 ranges from $18 billion to more than $24 billion, according to various government projections. Moreover, the sanctions imposed for annexing Crimea have sapped confidence in the overall Russian economy.The annexation still retains broad support in Crimea, since the many Russians living there yearned to be part of the motherland. Echoing the constant refrain of government officials, enthusiasts said they accepted short-term problems and were confident that matters would improve.Crimea\u2019s minister of agriculture, Nikolai P. Polyushkin, portrays his sector as robust. \u201cOf course we have faced some very unusual problems that we have never faced before, but this transition is going pretty well,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe receive a lot of help from the Russian side.\u201dThe Kremlin will provide $110 million to farmers this year, with only the distribution mechanism needing to be established, Mr. Polyushkin said. The Russian market will take whatever Crimea has to offer, he said, asserting improbably that there were \u201cno barriers\u201d to the Ukrainian market. True, the European Union last month banned all imports from Crimea, but if international buyers do not come, he said, \u201cthat is their problem that they lost Crimea.\u201dThe lack of water from Ukraine? \u201cIt is a problem, but it is not a catastrophe,\u201d said Mr. Polyushkin, who grew up on a collective farm here in Soviet times, when Crimea was an agricultural powerhouse.Transportation issues with the ferry? \u201cThis problem has been resolved,\u201d he said.The minister\u2019s assessment was so rosy, in fact, not to say remote from the reality farmers said they experienced, that it mostly provoked laughter from those outside government.They said they faced significant hurdles with both production and marketing.\u201cOf course officials in their offices will say that all is well,\u201d said Vitaly V. Polishuk, 42, the founder of Skvortsovo, one of Crimea\u2019s largest food producers. When Mr. Polishuk, a former athletic trainer, started the company a decade ago, it was making a little more than 1,200 pounds of sausages a day in a small village factory; last year its sales hit about $55 million, the company said.While Mr. Polishuk professed optimism about long-term prospects, both he and his managers said the company was trying to cope with the sudden loss of the Ukrainian market, where they were established players. Sales are off by about 50 percent and falling. Ukrainian companies have so far refused to pay roughly $2 million in outstanding bills, Mr. Polishuk said.Mr. Polishuk and his managers are also a bit daunted about how to compete against what they frequently refer to in conversation as the \u201csharks\u201d and \u201cmonsters\u201d of the Russian market.In Crimea itself, demand remains sturdy for Skvortsovo\u2019s salami, hot dogs and other meat products like the football-size \u201cDoctorskaya\u201d sausage \u2014 modeled on a 1930s Soviet \u201chealth\u201d product.But that demand pales in comparison to previous years when six million summer vacationers tripled Crimea\u2019s 2.3 million population. \u201cThis year we are only working at 35 percent of capacity,\u201d said Sergei A. Sazhienko, the director of the company\u2019s spotless, energy-efficient meat processing plant.Skvortsovo also cultivates fruits and vegetables, particularly the cabbage, beets, onions and carrots needed for borscht. After Ukraine blocked the North Crimean Channel, the main irrigation vein off the Dnieper River, the company relied on reservoirs and a small local river for water. But if the canal remains blocked next year, Skvortsovo may not plant vegetables, field managers said.The harvest of wheat and barley was down by about one metric ton per 2.5 acres because of the irrigation shortfall, said Dmitri V. Mozhaev, one of the company\u2019s senior farm managers.Growing produce is one thing. Getting it to Russia has become perhaps the bigger hurdle. It used to take trucks two days to cross eastern Ukraine to Moscow, but that highway runs through a combat zone.The ferry route and 1,250 miles of dubious highway beyond take a week to traverse. A costly bridge link to the mainland is at least four years away.Mr. Polyushkin, the agriculture minister, said produce trucks were waived right onto the ferry. Farm managers said that was news to them. Not only does the produce have to wait, but once the trucks get into Russia, Ukrainian license plates make them targets for constant stops, searches and shakedowns by the Russian police, producers said.A steady parade of senior Kremlin officials, including Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev and numerous ministers, have all promised help, farmers said. But little that is concrete has materialized.\u201cRussia talks about patriotism all the time, but they do not seem to be taking the simplest steps to promote Crimean goods,\u201d said Gennadi V. Potapenko, a publicist working for Skvortsovo.An article on July 8 about the problems that Ukrainian farmers and businessmen have experienced since Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in March misspelled the surname of a publicist for Skvortsovo, a Crimean food company. He is Gennadi V. Potapenko, not Potabenko.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sales of Big S.U.V.s Pulling the Weight at General Motors", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the redesigned 2015 Chevrolet Suburban started coming off the assembly line this year, Mike Quinto made sure he was one of the first to buy one, ordering it, sight unseen, two months ahead of time.Mr. Quinto, a technology consultant from Blowing Rock, N.C., is well aware that the fuel economy of his four-wheel-drive Suburban, a large sport utility vehicle, is low, officially rated at a combined 18 miles a gallon. But it is a trade-off he is willing to make for something that can handle his work travel and weekends in the mountains with his children.\u201cI didn\u2019t buy the vehicle for the gas mileage,\u201d he said. \u201cI bought it for everything it can do for me and my family.\u201dTens of thousands of buyers have similarly flocked to buy G.M.\u2019s largest S.U.V.s \u2014 and buoyed the company\u2019s bottom line just when it needs it most. Mired in a recall scandal over defective ignitions that has now, along with other safety-related charges, cost the automaker $3.8 billion, G.M. has been hammered on its income statement. On Thursday, the company said its earnings in the second quarter dropped 85 percent from a year ago.But G.M. would be in worse shape financially without the surging sales of its large sport utility vehicles, which many once wrote off as artifacts of prerecession excess.G.M. emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 with $49.5 billion in taxpayer money and a promise to diversify its lineup of vehicles. Gone would be the days of relying on the huge \u2014 and hugely profitable \u2014 sport utility vehicles that sold so well when the economy was booming. Instead, the new G.M., facing the collapsing sales of its largest vehicles, would build fuel-efficient, smaller cars to compete with foreign automakers that had gobbled up market share.But as G.M. finds itself embroiled in an endless wave of recalls that now stands at around 29 million vehicles worldwide, the company has, by design or not, embraced its old playbook of marketing cavernous S.U.V.s \u2014 a segment it dominates even more today than in previous years. While competitors like Ford and Nissan have largely shifted resources away from such large vehicles, G.M. has stayed with them, and it now commands more than 70 percent of the market.\u201cI don\u2019t think S.U.V.s will ever get back to their heyday, but G.M. absolutely owns the big S.U.V. space, and right now they\u2019re relying on that,\u201d said Tim Fleming, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, the auto research firm.That translates to big profits. With prices that can approach $65,000 for a full-feature Suburban, and even more for a Cadillac Escalade, big sport utility vehicles can increase G.M.\u2019s bottom line in a way that smaller vehicles cannot.While G.M. would not provide profit margins, analysts estimate that the company has to sell five small cars like the Cruze to equal the profit of just one Suburban. G.M.\u2019s largest S.U.V.s reach profits of up to $10,000 a vehicle, said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with Cars.com. By contrast, its smaller cars make about $1,500 to $2,000. Altogether, the large S.U.V.s have added about $1 billion to G.M.\u2019s bottom line this year.What\u2019s more, G.M. has not had to pile on incentives like rebates and bottom-rate financing to move its big S.U.V.s \u2014 in fact, the automaker reduced them once again in June. According to data from Kelley Blue Book, incentives on the Tahoe and Suburban in June were barely half of what they were a year ago, with Yukon incentives down nearly $1,000 to $2,500.And sales are booming. G.M. has sold nearly 46,000 Chevrolet Tahoes this year through June, up 12 percent from 2013. It has sold nearly 24,000 Suburbans (a 9 percent rise); about 19,000 GMC Yukons (up 54 percent); and 7,000 Cadillac Escalades (up 18 percent). In June alone, sales of the four vehicles rose 86 percent from a year earlier.\u201cThey needed this market to turn for S.U.V.s, and it\u2019s turned,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst with auto research firm Edmunds.com.Fueling this new boom for bigger rides is an improved economy. But Ms. Caldwell said social norms were also starting to change: Big sport utility vehicles do not have the stigma they had in the depths of the recession.\u201cNow it\u2019s O.K. again to buy an S.U.V., where for a while it was somewhat iffy,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who\u2019d downsized probably weren\u2019t fully satisfied with what they had, so they\u2019re going back to the big ones they like.\u201dA G.M. spokesman, James Cain, said while the market for big S.U.V.s might not be what it once was, it\u2019s proving to be a \u201cvery successful business\u201d for the company. \u201cEvery global automaker has areas they specialize in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one that we know well, and which we continue to dedicate resources to.\u201dTo keep up with demand, the Arlington, Tex., plant that makes the Suburban is running 24 hours a day, in three shifts, along with extra work on weekends, said Mark Clawson, G.M.\u2019s Tahoe and Suburban marketing manager. He said there was something about the biggest sport utilities that creates loyal customers.\u201cOnce they get into a vehicle this size, and realize how accommodating it is to their needs, they have a hard time giving up that space,\u201d Mr. Clawson said.Mr. Quinto, the Suburban buyer from North Carolina, said he test-drove other large vehicles, but even the accouterments of more luxury brands did not hold up.

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Other Beautiful Games", "Date": "2014-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANAUS, Brazil \u2014 It was a newsroom like any television station newsroom, unless you count the brunette receptionist wearing a crown, sash and leopard print dress and offering friendly advice on how to spice up the World Cup.\u201cBeauty queens,\u201d Brenda Pontes, 19, said.The World Cup does have many things \u2014 consuming attention, enthralling soccer and a carnival atmosphere \u2014 but it does not have beauty queens.In the Amazon rain forest, though, there is a tournament that is equal parts soccer and beauty pageant. It is one of the largest and most unusual amateur soccer competitions in the world, and perhaps the only one with a reality show. Pontes is the reigning queen.The tournament is called the Pelad\u00e3o. The name is a reference to pelada, a Portuguese word that can mean a naked woman. But in this case it means soccer disrobed of big money and glamour and revealed in its informal essence \u2014 pickup games played in Brazil on dusty fields, on sandy beaches and even on ferries in floating villages.About 1,100 teams and 23,000 players compete yearly in the Pelad\u00e3o and its affiliated tournaments. Each of the 500 or so teams in the main field will enter a queen. Parallel competitions will run from mid-September until early January, one to determine the champion soccer team and the other to choose the Queen of the Pelad\u00e3o.Why mix a soccer tournament with a beauty pageant? One must consider Brazil\u2019s passions, said Messias Sampaio, 69, a lawyer who founded the Pelad\u00e3o in 1973 when he was a newspaperman.\u201cIn Brazil, every business promotion has football, beautiful women and beer,\u201d Sampaio said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have these, it will not be successful.\u201dOn Sept. 13, Pontes will arrive by helicopter to the opening ceremony, where the queens will parade in team jerseys and bikinis before a panel of judges. Organizers hope to use Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia, which hosted four World Cup matches here.\u201cThere are two queens in the world,\u201d Pontes, a college freshman who hopes to become a police chief, said with a laugh. \u201cQueen Elizabeth and me.\u201dThe queens of Pelad\u00e3o teams might not own any crown jewels, but they wield significant influence on the soccer competition. If a queen does not show up for the opening ceremony, her team is disqualified. No excuses, even for illness or death in the family, are accepted. If the queen is not there, her team is out.\u201cWe\u2019ve had fistfights,\u201d said Kid Mahall, 45, a television producer and director who coordinates the beauty pageant. \u201cBut the teams are always eliminated.\u201dYet a faltering team can also be saved by its queen.If a team is eliminated on the field but its queen keeps advancing, the team enters a satellite tournament with a chance to rejoin the Pelad\u00e3o in the late rounds. A team nicknamed Arsenal won first place in 1998 after such a rescue.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge responsibility,\u201d Pontes said. \u201cThe queens want to be in the final, and the team wants the same thing.\u201dOnce, even tinted contact lenses were forbidden among the beauty contestants, according to the book \u201cFutebol: The Brazilian Way of Life,\u201d by the British writer Alex Bellos. Breast implants were also prohibited, Mahall said. Now, there are just two basic requirements: The queens must attend the opening parade and they must be women.\u201cThey had cross-dressers in the past,\u201d Mahall said. \u201cNow that\u2019s forbidden. It\u2019s a female competition.\u201dAs the soccer tournament plays on, the field of beauty contestants is narrowed from 500 to a final dozen. Several years ago, a new twist was added: a reality show called \u201cPelad\u00e3o Onboard.\u201dThe final dozen contestants are sent on a yacht down the Rio Negro, the largest tributary of the Amazon. The show is broadcast nightly for a month on a regional channel of a media conglomerate called A Cr\u00edtica, and the queens face challenges like rowing a boat, setting a table and dressing quickly in cramped spaces.\u201cThe first test was to dress up in five minutes,\u201d Pontes said. \u201cThe bedrooms are so tight, and I had three pieces of luggage.\u201dOnce the final three contestants are chosen, organizers said, television viewers decide the Queen of the Pelad\u00e3o. The women are mostly ages 18 to 28 \u2014 students, factory workers, some wanting to be famous, others seeking a brief escape from the everyday.Pontes, in high school a year ago, wanted to honor her brother, Sans\u00e3o Carioca Miranda, who was shot to death in 2012, at age 24, when someone tried to steal his motorcycle.That same year, at the 40th Pelad\u00e3o tournament, one of the queens was Marcia de Almeida Lobo, a 34-year-old street cleaner and a mother of five. Lobo had no delusions of winning, she told the newspaper A Cr\u00edtica, but as a child she watched the Pelad\u00e3o parades and allowed herself to dream.\u201cI saw the queens, these beautiful girls, in front of the team carrying the flag,\u201d Lobo told A Cr\u00edtica. \u201cThe only thing I could think about was that, one day I, too, wanted to be a queen of the Pelad\u00e3o.\u201dStories like Lobo\u2019s make the soccer tournament \u201ca shout for freedom,\u201d said Arnaldo Santos, 75, a radio journalist and soccer commentator who has been the Pelad\u00e3o\u2019s chief organizer since 1998.\u201cThere is no separation of the social classes,\u201d Santos said. \u201cThe rich and poor are mixed. Some people don\u2019t even know what they are going to eat on Monday, but on Sunday they are playing and people are applauding.\u201dThe tournament began after Brazil\u2019s former military dictatorship declared Manaus a free-trade zone, attempting to revive an economy that faded after a rubber boom of the late 1800s went bust.Immigrants began streaming into Manaus, and the Pelad\u00e3o helped provide recreation for these new arrivals and relieve tensions between neighborhoods, said Sampaio, its founder.He was a reporter at the time, and the Pelad\u00e3o had another purpose \u2014 enhancing the circulation of a new Sunday edition of the A Cr\u00edtica newspaper.The first parade of queens was held in 1974 on a square near Manaus\u2019s San Sebastian Church. The ceremony drew tens of thousands of spectators, Sampaio said, and the ire of the local clergy.In these interactive graphics, videos, slide shows and articles, The Times covered the action on the field and far from it. Dig in, but be sure to save time for Spot the Ball.\u201cWhile the parade happened outside, the priest was talking bad things about us inside,\u201d Sampaio said, laughing. \u201cHe accused the Pelad\u00e3o of exploiting women. Soccer balls were hitting the faithful as they came out of church. It was an organized mess.\u201dIn some ways, it still is. Car lights have illuminated games on makeshift fields after dark. A referee was chased up a tree by a Rottweiler unleashed by an irritated team owner. Another referee dispersed an agitated crowd with a fake pistol. To rebut charges of exploitation, Sampaio decreed that queens be accompanied at appearances by their mothers or a close relative. Recently, the mother of Pontes, the reigning Queen of the Pelad\u00e3o, told a photographer, \u201cDon\u2019t kidnap her; if you do, kidnap me, too.\u201dToday, Manaus has two million people, and the Pelad\u00e3o has added a masters division and related tournaments for women, children, indigenous tribes and teams from the interior of the state of Amazonas. Last year, 1,142 teams and 22,983 players participated. A recent championship match drew a crowd of more than 40,000. Some rules have been tailored to the competition. Offside is not called. The ball can be kicked instead of thrown into play from out of bounds. Yellow cards can be expunged by buying balls for disadvantaged children.As the tournament has grown, so have the stakes. Former professionals regularly play. Team sponsors provide jobs to top players or school fees for their children. And violence has intruded. Last December, a goalkeeper named Paulo Christian Bezerra da Silva, 36, was shot and killed, reportedly for refusing to throw a semifinal game.The Pelad\u00e3o reality show, broadcast aboard a yacht, leaves the tournament vulnerable to charges of elitism, Sampaio said. \u201cThis is going to end the Pelad\u00e3o,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no poor women on that boat.\u201dYet for now, the allure of being named Queen of the Pelad\u00e3o remains strong, the rewards generous. Pontes won a car last year, which she sold to pay for college and housing. She took a job as a receptionist at the A Cr\u00edtica television station and has endorsed beauty products, lingerie and jewelry. For the last month, Pontes has been a cheerleader on a nightly program devoted to that other soccer tournament, the World Cup.She aspires to win other beauty contests. And why not? Priscilla Meirelles de Almeida, a former Queen of the Pelad\u00e3o, was named Miss Earth in 2004. Pontes will start with less global ambitions.\u201cI will be Miss Brazil one day,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Africans Open Fuller Wallets to the Future", "Date": "2014-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Across sub-Saharan Africa, consumer demand is fueling the continent\u2019s economies in new ways, driving hopes that Africa will emerge as a success story in the coming years comparable to the rise of the East Asian Tigers in the second half of the 20th century.After seeing years of uninterrupted economic expansion across Africa, governments, analysts and investors are focusing on this fast-growing continent\u2019s shoppers and workers rather than just the usual upswing in commodity prices that have driven past cycles of boom and bust.\u201cThe development is real, and on the back of that, there\u2019s a lot of commercial opportunity that\u2019s emerging,\u201d said Simon Freemantle, senior political economist at Standard Bank here.At times messy and difficult to quantify, Africa\u2019s economies give pessimists and optimists plenty of statistical ammunition to support their narratives of the future. Growth is uneven. Inequality is rising in many corners. Millions of people still live in extreme poverty. With violence simmering in the Central African Republic, South Sudan and elsewhere, it\u2019s easy to fall back on the old pessimistic plotline for sub-Saharan Africa.The middle class has expanded rapidly across the continent, but the population has grown so quickly that the absolute number of impoverished Africans has gone up at the same time. Sushi restaurants in Dakar, Senegal, and fancy coffee shops in Kigali, Rwanda, do not improve the lives of subsistence farmers in the hinterland.Yet a sign of confidence is the success with which African countries have been able to tap international capital markets of late. In spite of recent terrorist attacks, Kenya sold $2 billion worth of bonds to international investors last month, which will be used in part to pay for infrastructure projects; two months earlier, it was Zambia with a $1 billion offer.But some of the most rapid growth is now coming from other sectors. In South Africa, for example, the broader economy has been sluggish, but the black middle class now spends more money than the white middle class.For decades, this country\u2019s long-neglected black consumers spent their money on the far edges of the economy, buying necessities like soap, salt and milk at informal convenience stores called spaza shops. During the hard years of apartheid, Itumeleng Mothibeli\u2019s grandparents ran one such shop in a township, the peri-urban communities to which blacks had been exiled under the racist system.Now Mr. Mothibeli manages 14 shopping centers spread across four provinces of South Africa for the Vukile Property Fund. The company targets the long-shunned township market for its high volume, turnover and foot traffic. Instead of the one-story brick stand adjacent to his grandparents\u2019 house, these are enormous Western-style shopping malls that are doing brisk business.\u201cIn the old days, you had cathedrals in the middle of towns,\u201d said Mr. Mothibeli, 30, as he drove a gold Toyota Corolla company car into the parking lot of the Daveyton mall. \u201cNow you have shopping centers.\u201dThe African Development Bank gave the so-called Africa Rising debate a significant jolt in 2011 with a report declaring that the African middle class had grown to 350 million people in 2010 from 126 million in 1980. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development put the figure in 2010 at a mere 32 million, \u201cor roughly the same as Canada.\u201dMiddle class is a fraught, even political, expression. In the United States, it conjures the image of a suburban house with a white picket fence and a car in the garage. The African Development Bank, on the other hand, defines someone as middle class if he earns $2 a day or more.\u201cThe future is about that lower middle class that\u2019s expanding quickly,\u201d said Staffan Canback, managing director of the consultancy Canback & Company, who has done business in Africa for decades. He was talking about the people with enough money left over for small packets of detergent or who can save money for name-brand shoes. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to see a middle class even in a place like Angola,\u201d Mr. Canback said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go, but I think it\u2019s incorrect to say that it\u2019s only a few families that make all the money and no one else makes money. That\u2019s definitely not true.\u201dBusinesses alert to the opportunities are setting up shop in Africa.There are more than twice as many people considered middle class in sub-Saharan Africa than there were 30 years ago. But in most countries, the poorer and richer classes grew as well, so income distributions have gone largely unchanged.Perhaps no country illustrates the pitfalls and opportunities quite as starkly as Nigeria. Even as the country is projected to grow at a swift 7.3 percent clip this year and next, the kidnapping and murdering by Boko Haram militants, who operate with impunity in Nigeria\u2019s northeast, transfix the world.Adewale Opawale, executive director at Strategic Research and Management (Stream) Insight, a market and social research company in Lagos, said he had witnessed drastic change not just in the number of cars on the streets and airplanes taking off from the international airport there, but in the way that people do business.Consumers are moving from running around with cash for purchases to using their Internet-enabled cellphones (many with more than one phone) to place orders from online retail chains that have started to cash in on the country\u2019s rising middle class. \u201cIt\u2019s loads of opportunity in the Nigerian consumer market,\u201d he said. \u201cNigeria is on track to become one of the 20 largest economies in the world.\u201dThe commercial gains are not spread equally across society or across the continent. A study of the top African brands found that of the top 25, all but one \u2014 Kenya\u2019s Safaricom \u2014 came from Nigeria or South Africa. Seven of the top 10 brands were South African. How the spoils of growth are shared is as important as the national averages that mask deep inequality. The goal is a broad-based improvement in the lives of the masses, which has proved elusive.\u201cThe question of how the poor fared in the period of rapid growth in the last decade in Africa is a subject of controversy,\u201d said Mthuli Ncube, chief economist at the African Development Bank. \u201cThe precise relationship between poverty and growth in the long term depends crucially on a growth pattern that is accompanied by structural shifts where labor moves from a low productivity to high-productivity sectors.\u201dThat means more good jobs in manufacturing and services and fewer subsistence farmers. But that has been a goal for leaders across Africa since the dawn of the postcolonial period.Whether the continent\u2019s governments are up to the task, there is no question that the individual, entrepreneurial drive is present and pushing Africa ahead.\u201cThere\u2019s just this amazing determination to get places,\u201d said John Simpson, director of the Unilever Institute of Strategic Marketing at the University of Cape Town. \u201cIt\u2019s a relentless desire to make more, to get better, to have a better lifestyle.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on July 21 with an article about increased investment in manufacturing and retail operations across sub-Saharan Africa, fueled by consumer demand among a rising black middle class, misstated the name of a mall near Johannesburg where a saleswoman was shown talking to shoppers. It is the Daveyton mall, not Daveytown.Advertisement"}

Beer in hand, he nodded toward Robby Ayala, a comedian and employee of Niche, the social media management agency Mr. Lachtman, 32, founded with a partner last July. Mr. Ayala was one of more than a dozen Niche members invited to the company-sponsored happy hour.In an era of new economies, this may be one of the most curious: the network that has sprung up to help the follower-laden stars of Instagram, Vine, Pinterest and other social media services make money by connecting them with brands wanting to advertise to their audiences. People like Mr. Lachtman and his co-founder, Rob Fishman, run what may be seen as a parallel universe to Hollywood, one in which shares and likes matter more than box-office sales and paparazzi shots. Here, authenticity \u2014 a word that comes up often in this arena \u2014 trumps a Photoshop-perfect facade or publicist-approved message.\u201cYou come work with GrapeStory,\u201d he added, \u201cyou\u2019re guaranteed to make five and six figures per year.\u201d\u201cPeople still come and think they can get away with that, and it\u2019s like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Stein said, throwing up his hands. \u201cWhat are they thinking? It\u2019s literally getting away with robbery.\u201dIf Mr. Stein comes out swinging, Ms. Eswein coddles. She acts as a kind of den mother to the more than 1,000 Instagram photographers Cycle represents, who have been paid to do projects for brands including Michael Kors and Coach. \u201cIt\u2019s less about, how much can you make this year, and more about educating the photographer and what their worth is,\u201d she said.That worth can be significant. Niche\u2019s so-called branded marketing deals can pay upward of five figures a post \u2014 enough that one of Biggie\u2019s owners, Lindsey Louie, quit her job with Google to work full time on Biggie\u2019s feeds and work as the company\u2019s community manager. Niche also enables creators to track their performances across social networks (what post got like after like on Instagram but flopped on Facebook, for example) and allows brands to see which creators work best for them.\u201cWe\u2019ll do stuff like discount codes,\u201d Mr. Lachtman explained on a Wednesday afternoon in Niche\u2019s San Francisco office. This time, Biggie was out of the crate and padding across the conference room table, paws sometimes landing on Mr. Lachtman\u2019s MacBook. \u201cBiggie gets a custom code; let\u2019s see how many BarkBoxes he sells versus other dogs.\u201d\u201cThe dog demographic on these social platforms is huge,\u201d he added, scanning Biggie\u2019s statistics on his screen. Mr. Lachtman recounted an April Fool\u2019s Day campaign Niche did with American Eagle called American Beagle. \u201cWe flew a bunch of dogs to their headquarters in Pittsburgh,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we had five dogs that each had 400,000 followers. It\u2019s a crazy audience. It works really well.\u201dBrands see upsides beyond increasing their profiles. They can spend far less on an advertising campaign executed through these social media platforms than more mainstream ones, which is part of the allure of hiring a budding Instagram photographer to shoot a project versus, say, Mario Testino.General Electric, which came to Niche to find people to evangelize \u201cSpring Break It,\u201d a campaign to promote its work with advanced materials, declined to say how much it paid each of the eight creators it involved in the project, but Linda Boff, G.E.'s executive director of global brand marketing, described it as \u201ca fraction of a fraction of the cost\u201d the company would have paid to advertise on a traditional distribution channel, like television.\u201cI don\u2019t know, social media and marketing seem a lot more interesting than civil procedure,\u201d he said. \u201cLaw school didn\u2019t really interest me. I was in class just avoiding getting called on by the professor.\u201dFor social media stars, this is part of what makes agencies that cater to them crucial: They focus on people (possibly fighting sleep in a law school classroom) who may not be discovered by traditional means, whose talents may not fit into an existing category, unlike the Justin Biebers of the YouTube world.\u201cYou can only do so much on your own,\u201d he mused at Niche\u2019s happy hour, twiddling with his iPhone, which he had just used to edit an \u201coutfit of the day\u201d shot of Ms. Louie, one of Biggie the dog\u2019s owners. (\u201cV8, there\u2019s no V8 filter, that\u2019s a juice!\u201d he joked during the process, swiping through an array of photo retouching apps as Ms. Louie looked over his shoulder.)Dan Porter, in charge of WME\u2019s digital division, likes to refer to Ms. Cho and her ilk as \u201cdigital first\u201d talent. \u201cTheir talents are eventually going to cross over a lot of platforms,\u201d Mr. Porter said, talking about the potential for a Vine star to do a live tour or a Pinterest personality to put out a book. (Ms. Cho has written two books.)In this world, the line between traditional and social stardom is growing ever more blurry. So is the distinction between competitor and cohort: WME is an investor in Niche. Mr. Porter admitted \u201cwe\u2019re in that middle fuzzy zone\u201d of figuring out how this new world of fame management will work, but said at least within the walls of WME, \u201cthe goal of the digital division is for there to be no digital division.\u201dHe offered a comparison to music videos: \u201cIt used to be when MTV was big, people would say, \u2018This guy\u2019s a music video director.\u2019 \u201d\u201cThe director of a Loverboy video from 1987 was a guy named David Fincher,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo one talks about him as a music video director.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran Outlines Nuclear Deal; Accepts Limit", "Date": "2014-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA \u2014 Iran\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator, faced with an imminent deadline for an agreement with the West on the future of the country\u2019s nuclear program, said in an interview on Monday that Iran could accept a deal that essentially freezes its capacity to produce nuclear fuel at current levels for several years, provided it is then treated like any other nation with a peaceful nuclear program.The proposal, which Iran said was conveyed to the United States and five other world powers during closed-door negotiating sessions in Vienna, would effectively extend a limited series of concessions Iran made last November as part of a temporary deal to get negotiations started on a permanent accord. In return, Iran wants step-by-step relief from sanctions that have substantially weakened its economy.\u201cI\u2019m not here to present maximalist positions,\u201d Mr. Zarif said in an interview in a 175-year-old neoclassical former palace, now a luxury hotel where the negotiators are living and working. \u201cWe\u2019re here to reach an agreement.\u201dMr. Zarif\u2019s decision to go public with what he called an \u201cinnovative proposal\u201d appeared motivated to achieve two goals: to make it harder for the White House to walk away from a deal that would establish intrusive inspections and freeze Iran\u2019s program, but also to offer just enough for both sides to propose extending the talks beyond Sunday, the current deadline.Such arguments are a reminder that this negotiation is taking place on at least two levels: a political discussion that is focused on whether two countries that have been implacable adversaries for more than 30 years can finally reimagine their relationship in the broadest terms, and a technical discussion that is both mind-boggling in its complexity and mired in distrust.In specific terms, Iran will press for the restrictions on its program to be short-lived, perhaps three to seven years; the United States has said that period must be in the \u201cdouble digits,\u201d meaning at least a decade. After the agreement expired, Iran would be free to produce as much fuel as it wanted as a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, as long as it abided by the treaty\u2019s inspection rules.Moreover, Congress will be looking for sharp, perhaps permanent, limits on Iran\u2019s capability, or even on its development of next-generation centrifuges, in return for lifting American sanctions.Mr. Zarif rejected the concept that Iran would be subject to any permanent limits, and he did not use the word \u201cfreeze,\u201d because his proposal would allow the kind of production of low-enriched uranium fuel that Iran has underway now, under a temporary accord. But he said, \u201cI can try to work out an agreement where we would maintain our current levels.\u201dTo provide further assurances to the United States and others, he said, Iran would convert most of the nuclear fuel it produces into a form that is impossible to use in a weapon, and forgo the construction of the facility that would be needed for the first step of converting it into bomb-grade fuel.Asked about his proposals, a senior administration official involved in the talks here, who would not speak on the record, said: \u201cWe have consistently said we wouldn\u2019t negotiate in public, and we\u2019re not going to start doing so now. Some of the things described in this interview they have put forward in negotiations. Some have not come up. And on some, they\u2019ve shown more flexibility behind closed doors.\u201d Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.American officials said that keeping the 22,000 nuclear centrifuges Iran now has in place \u2014 slightly fewer than half of which are now operating \u2014 creates the risk that in the future Iran could throw out international inspectors and turn the centrifuges back on, much as North Korea did in recent years with another bomb-making technology.But Mr. Zarif\u2019s decision to go public with the proposal in a 45-minute conversation before meeting with Mr. Kerry for a second time in two days was clearly tactical. His willingness to move away from Iran\u2019s insistence that it must be free, immediately, to expand its nuclear program may give Mr. Kerry room to recommend to President Obama that the negotiations continue, for weeks or months.In the interview, Mr. Zarif accused the West of trying to sabotage a heavy-water reactor under construction near Arak by altering components of its cooling system, a step he said could have led to an \u201cenvironmental catastrophe.\u201d But he did not directly blame the United States.\u201cYou know about cyberattacks,\u201d Mr. Zarif said, referring to the American- and Israeli-led operation called Olympic Games that blew up roughly one thousand centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant until it was discovered in 2010. He said a foreign power had tried \u201cto create malfunctions in equipment\u201d purchased for the Arak plant from outside Iran \u201cso that for instance instead of cooling the facility they would have increased the heat in the facility, had we not detected it\u201d in time.Mr. Zarif offered no evidence, and when pressed, he said his own briefings on the subject have been sketchy. Arak has been a known target of Western intelligence because it has the potential to produce weapons-usable plutonium. He said Iranian engineers found what he contended was sabotage before it could create \u201chuge problems.\u201dThe core measure of whether Mr. Zarif\u2019s proposal will gain traction focuses on what nuclear experts call \u201cbreakout capacity,\u201d the speed at which Iran could produce the fuel for a single nuclear weapon. The American position has been that only by dismantling a large proportion of Iran\u2019s centrifuges can the United States and its European allies extend that time to a year or more.Mr. Zarif combined his proposal of a freeze with an offer to take the nuclear fuel produced by its 9,000 or so working centrifuges and convert it to an oxide form, a way station to being made into nuclear fuel rods. He said that Iran would guarantee, during the agreement, not to build the facility needed to convert the oxide back into a gas, the step that would have to precede any effort to enrich it to 90 percent purity, which is what is generally considered bomb-grade.He clearly signaled that he had some room to negotiate on how long the freeze would last because Iran has an agreement with Russia to provide fuel for its Bushehr nuclear plant for the next seven years. \u201cWe want to produce only what we need,\u201d he said. \u201cSince our reactor doesn\u2019t need fuel for another seven years we don\u2019t have to kill ourselves for it. We have time.\u201dAmerican officials say that argument is specious; Russia must license the fuel for its reactor and does not want to give up the business. They doubt Iran could safely make the fuel for that reactor.At talks in Vienna on Monday, participants said, a series of exchanges focused on whether Iran\u2019s leadership was willing to give up hopes of industrial-scale nuclear fuel production for more than a decade, along with specifics of how it would answer questions about evidence that its scientists had worked on nuclear weapons designs.Robert Einhorn, who left the American negotiating team last year to return to the Brookings Institution, said that Mr. Zarif was clearly setting up a trade-off.\u201cIran\u2019s strategy seems to be to accept near-term limitations in exchange for longer-term freedom of action,\u201d he said.\u201cThe U.S. and its partners will want to scale back enrichment capacity and constrain R & D during the agreement, and lengthen the duration considerably.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prized but Perilous Catch", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFORT BRAGG, Calif. \u2014 Every year, as steady as the tides, lifeless bodies are pulled from the cold, restless water along the rugged coastline north of San Francisco. Most of the victims are middle-aged men. They wear black wet suits, usually hooded. They are often found in small coves framed by crescents of jagged rocks. An abandoned float tube sometimes bobs about nearby. Almost without exception, the victims are found wearing weighted belts that help them sink. Sometimes the bodies are discovered by friends nearby. If the fog is not too thick, the victims might be spotted from the towering bluffs above, where lifeguards patrol dozens of miles of desolate coast and armed game wardens spy for poachers. Many of the bodies are plucked from the swells by a search-and-rescue helicopter crew accustomed to making daring rope rescues and recoveries several times a year. The bodies are those of abalone divers.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of death in abalone diving,\u201d Nate Buck, a longtime Sonoma County lifeguard, said as he steered a pickup truck south along Highway 1, the Pacific Ocean churning below the cliffs to the right. In 14 years, he has lost count of how many bodies he has helped retrieve. \u201cLifeguards know that. Drive around here, and every one of these coves is another reminder.\u201dAbalone is an edible mollusk, a snail-like, single-shell gastropod found in coastal waters around much of the globe. But the red abalone is the biggest and the most prized, found only on the west coast of North America. In California, with a litany of restrictions to protect its fragile population, the hunt for wild red abalone is permitted only north of San Francisco, and only for sport. Part of the enduring allure is how easy it is to take part. No experience and little equipment are necessary. Air tanks are illegal. Abalone divers simply slip into the murky water and hold their breath, in search of a hidden prize. The red abalone\u2019s thick, domed single shell grows to more than 12 inches in diameter. Brick red on the outside and pearly silver on the inside, they are trophies, framed for the wall, mounted above a mantel or set along walkways as yard decorations. The meat inside, sometimes several pounds\u2019 worth, is a delicacy, with a taste and texture not unlike calamari. \u201cIt really is an iconic species for California,\u201d said Laura Rogers-Bennett of the University of California at Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory and a senior biologist for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. \u201cIt is a species that is part of our fishing heritage. And because of the size of red abalone, the biggest in the world, it\u2019s not unlike the redwood or the sequoia.\u201d During the seven-month diving season \u2014 April through November, with a hiatus in July \u2014 thousands arrive each weekend to the wild edges of Sonoma and Mendocino Counties, mostly, in serpentine parades from the south and the east. Divers are rooted in tradition and thrive on camaraderie, like those who hunt deer or pheasant elsewhere. They pour from cars and trucks and vans, dress themselves in rubber suits, burden themselves with as much equipment as they can carry and trudge down treacherous rocks to the ocean\u2019s edge. Those brave enough to dive deep below the water\u2019s surface for abalone or pick through the shoreline rocks during low tides may take no more than three in a day and 18 for the year. Each abalone has to be at least seven inches in diameter, meaning it is probably at least 10 years old. Each shell must be tagged and recorded immediately. It cannot be resold. But temptations are real, and the black market for poached red abalone is active, because a full-size one can fetch $100 or more. With roughly 250,000 red abalone legally captured for sport in California annually, and estimates that at least as many are taken illegally each year, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, including its undercover Special Operations Unit, spends as much time and resources protecting abalone as any other creature in California. Abalone, in other words, is a big deal in Northern California. \u201cIt\u2019s like the last warrior-hunter thing to do,\u201d said Sydney Smith-Tallman, whose family owns a dive shop in Fort Bragg that caters mostly to abalone hunters. \u201cThere\u2019s danger, thrill, beauty.\u201d And, though no one tracks the numbers specifically, up to a dozen people die doing it every year.\u2018The Dream of a Diver\u2019The holy grail for divers is an abalone with a 10-inch shell. No one has caught more than Dwayne Dinucci, a retired high school technical arts teacher who lives on a cul-de-sac in Union City, Calif., near Oakland. The license plate of his truck reads, \u201cPOPNAB\u201d \u2014 pop an ab, the widely used expression for plucking abalone, or abs, from their suctioned underwater homes on the rocks. \u201cTen inches is a landmark, the dream of a diver,\u201d he said. \u201cTo this day, 45 years later, when I find a 10-inch abalone, I am thrilled.\u201dDinucci had captured 343 abalone before the start of this season, including 20 that were more than 11 inches. The biggest he has caught is 11 29/32inches, just shy of the world record of 12 5/16 inches, set in 1993 by John Pepper, a former student of Dinucci\u2019s. Dinucci has four of the top 10 largest abalone caught on record in California, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.Charlie Lorenz held his tools for catching abalone in a dive bag as he prepared to slip into the water at Mendocino Headlands.\u201cThe lure is finding the world\u2019s largest abalone,\u201d Dinucci said. \u201cAnd on my gravestone it\u2019ll say, \u2018Never found it, but sure as hell tried.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The walls and rafters of his two-car garage are covered in hundreds of abalone shells, like hubcaps. They are perfectly aligned on hooks and labeled: size, date, time, location. The locations are intentionally vague, because a good abalone diver does not reveal such secrets. Dinucci, with a rim of gray hair and a salt-and-pepper mustache, usually dives with a group of like-minded, trophy-hunting friends. While some coves can be jammed with dozens of divers and pickers, Dinucci and his crew look for open water, about 12 feet deep, disguising rocky shoals. From an inflatable boat, they drop into the water, one held breath at a time. Dinucci has a customized boogie board \u2014 most use a float tube, which Dinucci finds too cumbersome \u2014 fitted with straps so he can hike up and down cliffs with it on his back. The board has hooks to connect to his necessary tools, such as fins, goggles, a waterproof flashlight and an abalone iron, like a small crowbar, used to pry abalone from rocks. Divers are required to carry gauges that measure seven inches, the legal size, but Dinucci\u2019s is 10, because he wants nothing smaller than that. He has no special ability for holding his breath \u2014 a minute at best \u2014 but has patience to dive and resurface dozens of times in pursuit of a single abalone. With tight limits on the catch, Dinucci does not want to pluck one that he will regret if he happens upon something larger. The water, besides being cold and rough, can be as murky as soup. Dinucci prowls the underwater rock formations, feeling with his hands, shining a light into dark holes. Some of his best catches have required him to squirm through narrow passageways. Others have necessitated great patience and reach, inserting the bar into a nook and under the abalone, hoping the slow-moving animal will slide and attach itself firmly enough to let Dinucci carry it to the surface like a Popsicle. \u201cI\u2019ve gone into holes and all of a sudden a swell will come over and suck you into the hole, even farther than you wanted to come in,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve come close to losing my life. But I\u2019ve had some scares. Which is good.\u201dDinucci said he had been thrown into rocks by sudden swells and so-called sneaker waves, known to pull unsuspecting beachgoers off the shore. In many places, the shoreline can be inaccessible because of cliffs.\u201cWhy do a lot of these people die?\u201d he asked. \u201cMostly inexperience. We get a lot of Southern California divers, but the North Coast is different. It\u2019s rough. And it can get rough\u201d \u2014 Dinucci snapped his fingers \u2014 \u201clike that. The key is to know where you\u2019re coming out. Getting in is easy. Coming out is the hard part.\u201dSurveillance and RaidsThe man on the phone wanted 45 abalone. The seller agreed to deliver them to him in San Francisco for $2,500, a reasonable black-market bulk price. A few days later, a car approached an auto repair shop on the west side of San Francisco, far from the tourist sites. It was met by an employee in coveralls and ushered into a service bay. Three coolers were removed and placed into the back of a Toyota Prius. Cash changed hands. \u201cOur guy\u2019s leaving,\u201d a voice on a walkie-talkie radio said. Unbeknown to the buyer, the seller worked for the Special Operations Unit of the state Fish and Wildlife Department. The shop was surrounded by agents in eight cars, parked on surrounding streets, connected by radios and cellphones. The 10-member unit is a type of SWAT team, charged with protecting California\u2019s wildlife resources from poachers and the black market. Among its chief concerns are sturgeon eggs, part of the high-dollar caviar market, and black bears, prized for body parts such as paws and gall bladders. Abalone, though, is the top priority. It was first harvested with regularity in California by Chinese immigrants in the mid-1800s, who mostly dried and exported it. The Japanese created many of the state\u2019s hundreds of commercial operations in the early 20th century. With the advent of scuba, divers could eventually collect 2,000 or more abalone a day. Concern grew as the red abalone population plummeted through the 1970s and 1980s. California took serious action in the 1990s, banning all commercial operations and declaring that sport diving (unassisted by air tanks, with no reselling allowed) could take place only north of the Golden Gate Bridge. (There remains a legal, niche business for small, farm-raised abalone steaks, sold to restaurants and consumers for roughly $125 per pound.) These days, about 98 percent of the legal abalone diving in California occurs off the remote coasts of Sonoma and Mendocino Counties. Even so, if biologists\u2019 estimates are correct, at least a quarter-million abalone are illegally poached each year off the coast of California, and the street value could be $25 million. \u201cIt\u2019s not endangered, but it\u2019s scarce,\u201d said Capt. Robert Farrell, head of the special operations unit. \u201cBut with lots of money from the black market, it could be endangered quickly.\u201d Last August, using armed wardens from across the state, Farrell\u2019s team led simultaneous early-morning raids on 14 homes in Sacramento, Oakland and several Bay Area suburbs. It was dubbed \u201cOperation Oakland Abalone Syndicate.\u201d Thirteen men, most of them Vietnamese, were charged with illegal possession of abalone, believed to be part of a black-market network. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him to date take 57 abalone,\u201d Lt. Patrick Foy said outside one Oakland house, noting that the annual limit in 2013 was 24. (It was reduced to 18 in 2014.) \u201cWe believe it\u2019s for commercial sale.\u201dAbalone remains a delicacy in many Asian cultures, treasured not only for taste, but also for medicinal qualities, including as an aphrodisiac. In drugstores in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, in glass apothecary jars kept on high shelves behind the counter, dried abalone can sell for $2,000 or more per pound. Frozen abalone, too, is commonly found in Asian restaurants and seafood markets, but often out of its original packaging and without proper paperwork. One Chinatown market recently offered it for $55 per pound in plain bags.Not all abalone is illegal \u2014 there are dozens of varieties, and many can be imported from other countries. For investigators, though, paperwork trails get lost in translation, and promising leads disappear in mistaken identities. Leads have led to massage parlors, nail salons and other businesses viewed skeptically as fronts for seafood poaching, among other illicit activities.The belief is that California abalone not only finances criminal activity, but makes its way across the ocean. In other countries, such as Australia and South Africa (where, this month, investigators found 36,340 abalone hidden inside a house), the authorities have connected abalone poaching directly to drug and arms cartels. California officials have been unable to draw as many straight lines. But they have made a string of large-scale abalone busts over the past two decades. In 2004, Warden Dennis McKiver boarded a commercial sea urchin boat in Mendocino County and found it jammed with 458 abalone \u2014 a load, presumably not the first, probably worth $40,000 on the black market.The two men aboard were arrested, barred from fishing for life, fined a combined $60,000 and sent to jail for two years. They remain oft-cited examples of the type of temptations facing divers of all kinds.\u201cSea urchins are nickels,\u201d McKiver said. \u201cBut next to those nickels are $100 gold pieces. And it\u2019s very tempting for those guys to grab a couple. And then it grows from there.\u201dAlong the coast, wardens sometimes dress in camouflage and hide on bluffs and in trees, spying on abalone divers through binoculars, recording what they see and citing offenders as they return to their cars.On a couple of busy weekends each season, they erect abalone checkpoints along the meandering two-lane highways leading to and from the coast. Hundreds of cars returning inland from abalone diving are diverted, their drivers and passengers politely questioned by uniformed wardens.Often, as cars approach the backup, abalone can be seen getting flung out windows in desperate attempts to avoid detection. Confiscated abalone is donated to area fund-raisers and local soup kitchens. Wardens mostly find improperly completed log sheets and an extra abalone or two. Even those can be costly violations. At the Mendocino County Courthouse in Fort Bragg, about a four-hour drive north of San Francisco, the docket is filled with abalone cases. A majority involve Asian defendants from the Bay Area, often requiring Vietnamese, Mandarin or Cantonese interpreters.Most want to avoid the headache of repeated trips to the courthouse and are circumspect about their chances of winning a trial. They accept a plea bargain, usually losing their fishing license for a year and paying more than $1,000 in fines and fees. Investigators, of course, want meaningful arrests. After unsuspectingly buying the 45 abalone from an informant in May, the suspect at the auto repair shop in San Francisco continued his shift, unaware that he was surrounded by a constellation of law enforcement agents. They had their dealer. They wanted to see what he intended to do with his stash.Two older men arrived in a pickup truck and went inside.\u201cProduct 1 out of the box, into white plastic bags,\u201d an agent reported through the radio. \u201cProduct 2 out of the box, into a plastic bag.\u201dIt appeared that four or five abalone changed hands. The men left. Agents had already run checks on their car, and had at least one name and address. They would find the men later. They stayed with the abalone.A couple of hours and many legitimate car repair customers later, another man left with four or five abalone. A woman accompanying him carried one in a bag. They left, also unfollowed.At closing time, the suspect left and unwittingly led a parade of cars, mostly S.U.V.s, through the streets of San Francisco. He pulled into an auto body shop in Daly City. Agents parked nearby and watched. An hour later, the suspect left in his car and drove to a home in South San Francisco. A woman came out. The man carried two of three coolers into the garage and closed it. She got in the car and they left. Several agents followed. Others stayed within sight of the house. And, taking turns, they staked it out, unnoticed, for four more days as the supply of abalone in the coolers dwindled. The man, a first-time offender, had no single buyer, just a lot of small ones. Some paid about $100 per abalone, investigators said, and others may have been given the abalone as a gift or a returned favor. The man was charged with unlawful purchase and sale of sport-caught fish/abalone. His web of connections was noted. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard community for us to infiltrate,\u201d Lt. Adrian Foss, who led the sting operation, said during the stakeout. \u201cBut as they become more desperate for product, they have to reach beyond their own circle in search of it.\u201dIt is just another kind of risk taken in the search for abalone. Danger In and Out of the WaterNot all abalone-related deaths are by drowning. In June, a 55-year-old man fell to his death immediately after diving while climbing a 100-foot cliff near Mendocino. Most out-of-water victims, however, are struck by heart attacks. They may drive hours to get to the coast and are eager to return with abalone, a quiet desperation that causes them to overlook ominous clues that the surf, tides and weather conditions silently provide to experienced divers. Water temperatures usually range from 47 to 56 degrees. An ability to see the rubber fins dangling from your toes counts as clarity. Divers wear constricting wet suits and weight belts, up to 30 pounds, designed to help offset their buoyancy. They sometimes panic when swept into riptides or swamped by sudden swells. Other dangers lurk in the depths, ranging from tangled forests of kelp to great white sharks.\u201cAll these things are layers upon layers of stress,\u201d said Buck, the Sonoma County lifeguard. \u201cAnd all that, unfortunately, is too much for people sometimes.\u201dTwelve years ago, when Buck was 21, he was diving off the rocks of Salt Point State Park with a 52-year-old uncle, an experienced diver from Southern California and an \u201cocean mentor\u201d to Buck. The man climbed out of the water and had a heart attack on the rocks. Help, as it is along this part of the coast, where traffic is light and cellphone reception is spotty, was slow to come.\u201cThe hardest part was calling my mother and telling her that her brother died,\u201d Buck said. \u201cHearing her anguish on the other end of the line is a sound I\u2019ll never forget.\u201dLike Buck, most lifeguards in Sonoma County gained experience much farther south, where beaches are sandy and dotted with \u201cBaywatch\u201d-style lifeguard stations. In Sonoma County, lifeguards work out of pickup trucks. They go where instinct, experience and unfamiliar parked cars tell them to look. The air temperature can be cold (often in the 50s in the summer) and so foggy that the high-pitched wail of young harbor seals is sometimes confused with that of a person in distress. \u201cI was a lifeguard in Southern California,\u201d said Tim Murphy, one of two uniformed state park peace officers who double as lifeguards on the Sonoma County coast. \u201cI never had a rescue where I worried about getting the person back to shore, nevertheless myself. Up here, it really is a mixed bag. You\u2019re in the water sometimes thinking, \u2018I hope my backup is here soon, because I\u2019m not sure I can pull this off myself.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Lifeguards learn to scan a cove of bobbing divers and instantly detect discomfort or inexperience by the way they hold their heads above the water or cling to their float tubes. They urge some out of the water with polite coaxing. If there are no imminent signs of trouble, they hike on to the next cove, or drive farther up the highway. \u201cYou are not expected to have drownings in Southern California,\u201d Buck said as he stood on rocks near where another lifeguard nearly lost his life a few years ago in an ill-considered, unsuccessful rescue attempt in churning water. \u201cHere, it\u2019s sort of the norm.\u201dAbalone season opens each year on April 1. By early May last year, four men had died while searching for abalone \u2014 three of them on the same weekend, the other a week later.On the last weekend of last season, during still weather in late November, a 67-year-old man from San Francisco was found in the same cove where Buck\u2019s uncle had died more than a decade before. A day later, divers noticed an unattended float a few miles south, near Fort Ross State Park. Buck rushed to the scene, where he found a 57-year-old man from Oakland at the floor of the ocean with his weight belt on. He was the seventh and final casualty of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if some will die,\u201d Murphy said in late May this year. \u201cBut when.\u201dWithin two weeks, two abalone divers were dead near Mendocino. And on June 29, a 44-year-old man became the season\u2019s third victim. He was sucked into an underwater cave. It took two days to recover the body because of high tides and strong swells.Most abalone divers, of course, do not see their hobby as a risk, but a reward \u2014 a chance for companionship, to enjoy the ocean and, if all goes well, capture an abalone that others envy. Abalone diving in Northern California is celebrated, not feared. The World Championship Abalone Cook-Off began at a dive shop in the late 1980s, but it now finds a home each fall at Noyo Harbor in Fort Bragg. On a sunbaked day last October, there were 20 booths, offering abalone won tons, abalone salsa, abalone ceviche (two kinds), abalone sausage, even abalone wrapped with dates, goat cheese and bacon, all of it deep fried. It is the pursuit of abalone, more than anything, that fills the campgrounds, motor lodges and bed-and-breakfasts up and down the coast in both directions. Fort Bragg used to have thriving lumber mills and commercial fishing operations. They have dried up. \u201cWhat we depend on now is tourism,\u201d said Charlie Lorenz, the self-proclaimed Abalone Hunter, who interviewed people at the cook-off for MendocinoTV.com. \u201cAnd what brings people here? Abalone.\u201dThe festive air belied an undercurrent of concern about the state of abalone diving. The total legal catch in Northern California has dropped more than half in the past 25 years, and restrictions tightened further in 2014. Longtime abalone divers worry about the trend and see a day when diving is banned completely. Some say it would be catastrophic to the area\u2019s economy and culture, and suggest it might make abalone more susceptible to poaching, not less, as if it were an illegal drug. The only certainty is that the coves that scallop the coastline would be emptier. And the lifeguards who patrol the bluffs and rough waters would have it easier, if they had a job at all.\u201cAbalone divers make up the bulk of our rescues,\u201d Buck said. \u201cThey\u2019re the reason we\u2019re here.\u201dAn earlier version of a photo caption in the slide show misspelled the surname and misstated the title of an official in the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. He is Capt. Robert Farrell, not Assistant Chief Bob Ferrell.An earlier version of a photo caption in the article misspelled the surname of a diver.

{"Headline": "The Bottom Line Should Decide", "Date": "2014-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesWith scintillating headlines and compelling story lines, the N.B.A. has continued to keep pace with global events like the World Cup and Wimbledon. The most intriguing news surrounds free agency \u2014 specifically, whether Carmelo Anthony will stay in New York with the Knicks or join some amalgamation of star players, possibly including LeBron James. While James is on vacation, his representatives are reportedly vetting offers for his talents. I followed the Kidd drama and the Anthony trip during the course of a meandering train ride from Seattle to Los Angeles. As I went past the mountains and wine country of Oregon, traveled through California\u2019s towns and cities, I wondered what the lives of the people there were like. I reminded myself that with health, love and freedom, one can happily live virtually anywhere. Having said that, on each flight home, I am reminded that there is no place like New York. And I suspect that Carmelo Anthony realizes as much.New York presents those who live there with the daily challenge of fighting, block by block, for recognition (and elbow room). No matter what you have, someone has more; no matter what you have accomplished, someone has accomplished more. Anthony is a great player, but Derek Fisher, his coach if he stays with the Knicks, has five championship rings. Phil Jackson, the team president, won 11 as a coach (and two as a player). A franchise needs at least two extraordinary players to have a realistic chance at a championship. The Knicks have one, Anthony \u2014 or one and a half if you include J. R. Smith. So the odds that Anthony earns his first ring with the team, which itself has not won a title for 41 years, are daunting. Still, the challenge is worth the millions of dollars Anthony would be paid, and he would share the burden with Jackson, whose job is to build a team of talented young players eager to prove themselves and willing to fit into a winning system.The popularly held sentiment is that Fisher is merely Jackson\u2019s coaching surrogate, and Anthony is not the best player for Jackson\u2019s triangle offense.But Jackson is not the coach. When he was hired, Fisher paid homage to the triangle but said somewhat cryptically that there was more than one way to play basketball. Regardless, the Knicks can at least try to lure Anthony with a larger contract than any other team can offer. Elsewhere in this round of free agency, too, the business of basketball is intriguing, and it may be influenced by, if not intertwined with, the Sterling affair. That someone is willing to pay that much money for a team, and that the value of the other teams in the N.B.A. most likely rose with the announcement of that deal, should make all the players in the league think before they accept any contract offer.The segment of the Sterling episode, in which he was secretly recorded making racist remarks, that continues to resonate is the part of the conversation when Sterling talked about all he did for his players. \u201cI support them and give them food and clothes and cars and houses,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cWho gives it to them?

{"Headline": "Only Netanyahu Can Put Out the Fire", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEL AVIV \u2014 In recent days, Israel\u2019s hawkish prime minister has found himself in an awkward situation. Benjamin Netanyahu is known abroad as a staunch right-winger. But now he needs to do the exact opposite of what his image suggests. He must restrain an Israeli instinct for revenge after the cold-blooded murder of three Israeli teenagers abducted by Palestinian terrorists. And he must also come up with a strategy for battling Jewish right-wing radicals after the murder of a Palestinian teenager that is feared to have been a retaliatory act by extremist Jews. The tides of sorrow and rage have changed rapidly in Israel in the last three weeks. The country united in worry, then in growing despair, then in grief and anger when the bodies were found. The leading suspects have known ties to Hamas, and the Israeli authorities believe the murders occurred minutes after the abductions took place, but finding the bodies took time and effort. Thousands of people attended the funeral of the slain teenagers \u2014 including Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cThe moral chasm that separates us from our enemies is deep and wide,\u201d he intoned. \u201cThey revere cruelty, and we pity.\u201d In responding to the killings, he used the language of a tough guy, and surely, he can be tough at times. But Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s years at the helm have been less bloody than those of many prime ministers, like Shimon Peres and Ehud Olmert, both of whom had a much more dovish image. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s predecessors were more accommodating in peace talks, but Mr. Olmert initiated a war in Lebanon in 2006 and a military operation in Gaza in 2009 in which more than 2,000 Arabs were killed. Under Mr. Netanyahu, military operations have been slow to come and quick to end. The violence continues, but at a much lower scale.It is a well-established fact in Israeli politics that it is easier for the left to make war, and easier for the right to make peace or show restraint \u2014 as the public will be less inclined to see the right as weak. During cabinet deliberations over Israel\u2019s response to the three murders, Mr. Netanyahu was a voice for restraint amid a barrage of bombastic vows of retribution by officials like the deputy defense minister, Danny Danon, and the economy minister, Naftali Bennett.But restraint is becoming more difficult with each passing day. Israeli towns have been hit by rocket barrages fired from Gaza, while Israel has intensified attacks on Hamas targets. Further escalation is a very real possibility. Yet as the prime minister ponders a possible escalation in dealing with the enemy, he also has to ponder escalation at home. Jewish extremism appears to have reared its ugly head, and may have crossed the line from incitement to murder with the killing of a 16-year-old Palestinian, Muhammad Abu Khdeir, in East Jerusalem. His burnt body was found in a forest on Wednesday. His family says he was abducted by Jews before morning prayers outside a mosque. Mr. Netanyahu has demanded a prompt investigation. He also strongly condemned \u201cthe reprehensible murder\u201d and called on people \u201cnot to take the law into their own hands.\u201d The anger of Israelis after the murder of three young countrymen is understandable, but citizens\u2019 calls for revenge are highly disturbing. The Israeli airwaves and social media have been saturated with disgraceful demands for vengeance. A prominent rabbi declared that \u201cthe disgrace will be paid for with the blood of the enemy, not with our tears,\u201d alluding to the biblical story of David, who killed 200 Philistines and presented their foreskins to King Saul.To the government\u2019s credit, there was no double talk. The message was rapid and clear: Israel is a country of law and order, not vigilantism.On Thursday, the Israeli police announced an investigation of a social media campaign of incitement against Arabs, and soldiers engaging in provocative acts were promptly jailed. Clearly, verbal condemnation is not enough. A strong government must act against those who take the law into their own hands. Too many Israelis harass Palestinians on the street and too many of those who carry out so-called price tag attacks \u2014 a euphemism for violent acts against Arabs \u2014 are still at large. The Israeli government wasn\u2019t always so serious about battling this phenomenon. The events of the last few days \u2014 and especially if the murder of Mr. Abu Khdeir proves to be an act of Jewish terrorism \u2014 make it essential that the government act forcefully to punish extremists. Mr. Netanyahu must restrain the most hawkish members of his own cabinet and fight the extremists outside it. Because he himself is a hawkish leader who can\u2019t be accused of bias against the right, Mr. Netanyahu is just the man for the job. Advertisement"}

Armed with a college journalism degree and work experience writing for a Maytag company magazine, she took an entry-level job assisting Fortune\u2019s male writers. The young woman, Carol Loomis, navigated the magazine\u2019s \u201cMad Men\u201d-like culture, on one occasion slapping a married colleague whom, she delicately recalled, \u201chad an agenda.\u201d She proved herself as a reporter but had to battle gender stereotypes. In 1970, she fought her way into an Economic Club of New York dinner after its director said he did not want \u201cany frivolous little Smith girls looking for a free dinner and the chance to spend an evening with 1,200 men in black tie.\u201d After 60 years at Fortune, Ms. Loomis is retiring as one of the country\u2019s most venerated financial journalists, with a collection of work that reads like a history of modern Wall Street.\u201cShe has an analytical mind and she keeps learning,\u201d said Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor and a close friend. \u201cWe males never do that. We quit at about 15. We just think we know it all. At 85, she is interested in learning more.\u201dIn the 1960s, she wrote one of the first articles about hedge funds. She reported two cover articles on the risk of derivatives in the mid-1990s, long before those instruments contributed to the near-collapse of the global economy. A 1999 piece, \u201cLies, Damn Lies and Managed Earnings,\u201d presaged the wave of accounting scandals a few years later. On Monday, Fortune will publish her final article before she retires, a piece about one of the world\u2019s most powerful financiers, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock. Ms. Loomis is perhaps best known as Mr. Buffett\u2019s Boswell. She has been Fortune\u2019s resident expert on Mr. Buffett since meeting him in 1966, and each year edits the annual shareholder letter of Mr. Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway, an unusual role for a financial journalist. The two speak nearly every business day and are frequent bridge partners, playing mostly over the Internet. She will have more time now for bridge. At her age, she said, it was becoming too difficult to jump on a plane and take extended trips to write the deeply reported, lengthy magazine features that she worked on throughout her career. \u201cI began to realize that some of the things that a Fortune writer needs to do, just take for granted, become a little bit harder at this age,\u201d said Ms. Loomis, seated in a Fortune conference room on Wednesday. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a Fortune writer who was constrained in any way.\u201dMs. Loomis stressed that her departure had no connection to the recent spinoff of Fortune\u2019s parent company, Time Inc., from the media conglomerate Time Warner. In fact, she said she was never fond of Time Inc.\u2019s 1989 merger with Warner Communications.\u201cI think it\u2019s good that we\u2019re out here on our own, don\u2019t have to send money to Time Warner, and we sent a lot of money to Time Warner,\u201d she said.When Ms. Loomis started at Fortune, she was surrounded by journalistic luminaries. The magazine\u2019s masthead included Hedley Donovan, who would go on to succeed Henry Luce as the editor in chief of Time Inc. William H. Whyte, author of \u201cThe Organization Man,\u201d the seminal book about corporate culture, and the famed photographer Walker Evans, were also on the magazine\u2019s staff. She soon became a luminary herself. Among her influential articles was a 1966 piece about another former Fortune employee, Alfred Winslow Jones, considered the father of the hedge fund industry. For decades, readers contacted Fortune for copies of the piece to use as a blueprint for using hedging techniques to make money on both rising and falling stocks. Ms. Loomis cast something of a skeptical eye on Mr. Jones\u2019s fund, calling his record in forecasting the market \u201conly fair.\u201d Alan Farnham, a former Fortune writer who worked at the magazine during the 1980s and \u201990s, said Ms. Loomis taught him how much work went into producing great journalism. He worked for her as a researcher, and remembers her arriving at the office with a suitcase of documents and poring over them for days. \u201cShe would research something to the nth degree before any of the interviewing started,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was evident by every word and deed that she was committing herself to an uninterrupted siege of work.\u201dFortune\u2019s editors helped Ms. Loomis over her six-decade career \u2014 she is Time Inc.\u2019s longest-serving employee \u2014 by allowing her a flexible schedule. In 1968, after she had her second child, her editors let her take summers off. As she hit her mid-60s, she cut her schedule to working seven months a year. And last year Andrew Serwer, Fortune\u2019s managing editor, agreed to cut back her output to three lengthy features a year.\u201cWe wanted to keep her and we wanted to keep her happy,\u201d Mr. Serwer said. \u201cYou should be flexible for your most important employees.\u201dShe was introduced to Mr. Buffett by her husband, John, a retired partner at First Manhattan, the New York investment manager. The couple, married 54 years, are longtime Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. They raised two children in Larchmont, N.Y., the Westchester suburb where they still live. Now that she is officially retired, Ms. Loomis said she hoped to first catch up on the lunches she missed while finishing her article on Mr. Fink and BlackRock. She also needs to find a place for the nine boxes of reporter\u2019s notes cluttering her garage. And she looks forward to playing more golf and bridge.Ms. Loomis also plans to continue her regular conversations with Mr. Buffett and assist him with his writings. After editing the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter for nearly 40 years, she likes to remind Mr. Buffett that he still needs her help. She said that dangling participles and the passive voice were persistent problems. \u201cI kid him,\u201d she said, \u201cthat he missed the class on active verbs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Instead of building an economy and housing for Gazans by using the many tons of concrete and other building materials that were allowed into Gaza, it used them to build tunnels to smuggle weaponry from Egypt and to cross under the border of Israel for future attacks against its citizens, as demonstrated this week.It\u2019s not the West\u2019s failure that brought about war, but Hamas\u2019s refusal to live peaceably side by side with Israel. To the Editor:The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. How many times has Hamas launched rockets into Israel only to have Israel respond in a heavy-handed way that multiplies the civilian death rate? The Likud Party tells Israelis that this hawkish approach will keep them safe, but it just makes them more vulnerable at home and abroad.It is time that Israelis and Palestinians started thinking in new ways. What if Hamas were overshadowed by a Palestinian peacemaker who could rally the international community against the occupation in the West Bank? What if Israel were to work to end the occupation in the West Bank and invest in building and development in the Palestinian territories?The situation wouldn\u2019t change overnight, but it would put the region on the road to a future in which Israeli and Arab children could walk around without the fear of being killed by a nationalistic zealot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goodbye to the Republican Wave?", "Date": "2014-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMidterm CalculusRepublicans entered this election cycle with high hopes. President Obama\u2019s approval ratings had sunk into the low 40s, and the rollout of the Affordable Care Act had been an unmitigated disaster. In an off-year election, Democrats weren\u2019t expected to fully mobilize the young and diverse coalition that has given them an advantage in presidential elections. Off-years are also when a president\u2019s party typically suffers significant losses.This year seemed poised to turn into another so-called wave election, like in 2006 or 2010, when a rising tide of dissatisfaction with the incumbent party swept the opposition into power. Given a favorable midterm map, with so many Democratic Senate seats in play, some analysts suggested that Republicans could win a dozen of them, perhaps even picking up seats in states like Virginia, New Hampshire and Oregon.The anti-Democratic wave might still arrive. But with three and a half months to go until November\u2019s elections, the promised Republican momentum has yet to materialize.The race for the Senate, at least right now, is stable. There aren\u2019t many polls asking whether voters would prefer Democrats or Republicans to control Congress, but the Democrats appear to maintain a slight edge among registered voters. Democratic incumbents in red Republican states, who would be all but doomed in a Republican wave, appear doggedly competitive in places where Mitt Romney won by as much as 24 points in 2012.The same could not be said for Rick Santorum or Blanche Lincoln in 2006 or 2010. The light-blue Democratic states and purple presidential battleground states, like Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and New Hampshire, all seem to be heading toward tight races or Democratic wins, as one would expect in a fairly neutral year.The race could break toward the Republicans over the next few months. There\u2019s reason to think it will: The president\u2019s approval ratings and the long history of the president\u2019s party losing in midterm elections are consistent with that possibility.But as July turns to August, the G.O.P. is now on the clock. If there is to be a wave this November, the signs of a shift toward the G.O.P. ought to start to show up, somewhere, soon. Every day that goes by without a shift toward the G.O.P. increases the odds that there will not be a wave at all.How could the Democrats dodge a wave, given the president\u2019s weak ratings and the long history of the president\u2019s party losing in midterms?Part of it might come from the unpopularity of the Republican Party. The G.O.P. is less popular today than it was in 2010, when G.O.P. favorability ratings increased and Democratic ratings faltered in advance of the midterms. Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings might also be deceptive: They\u2019re mainly low because of minimal support from Republican leaners, not because Mr. Obama has lost an unusual amount of ground among his own supporters.Another part might be the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which has faded from the forefront of the news. Whatever the public\u2019s view of the law, it is clear that it will not be as potent an issue as Republicans hoped it would be. Similarly, the economy and the deficit are both in a better place than they were in 2010.The Republicans will have a good chance of picking up the Senate without an anti-Democratic wave. There are so many Democratic-held seats up for grabs in red and purple states this year that the G.O.P. could take the Senate under neutral conditions. Candidates like Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, for instance, won by modest margins in 2008, even though it was an excellent year for Democrats and even though they were bolstered by huge black turnout.But if a wave doesn\u2019t materialize, and if Republicans don\u2019t post victories in Democratic-tilting states like Iowa or Colorado, it will be hard to consider 2014 a great year for Republicans. That will be true even if they take the Senate by taking advantage of a favorable map. The Republicans don\u2019t need more evidence of their ability to win with low Democratic turnout in states like Louisiana and Alaska heading into 2016. Fortunately for the G.O.P., there are still more than three months to go.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.\nnytimes.com/upshot Advertisement"}

That was the second-lowest reading for the moving average since August 2007.

Long-term savings are critical for individuals, families, the nation and the overall growth of our economy, whether the savings originate from an upper-income, middle-income or lower-income worker. The real question is how best to encourage all workers to save for a retirement that could last 10 years, 20 years or more.The universal 401(k) concept has always been controversial. Why not start with simple, common-sense solutions that offer a real possibility of success? For example, Congress could make it easier and advantageous for small employers to offer workplace savings opportunities, such as \u201cstarter\u201d 401(k)\u2019s with simple-to-administer rules. By focusing on small employers, Congress would tackle the coverage issue where it is most needed.Congress could also encourage employers currently without a workplace savings plan to automatically enroll employees in an individual retirement account. At the same time, it could provide a start-up credit to employers to offset initial and administrative expenses related to establishing automatic I.R.A.\u2019s.Such initial steps would get a necessary national discussion about retirement security off to a good start.

{"Headline": "Housing: Small Economic Sector With a Big Impact", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReal Estate and the RecoveryHousing is a pretty tiny part of the economy. But housing also plays an enormous role in creating economic booms and busts. This is one of the most important paradoxes of how the economy works that policy makers are only now starting to grapple with adequately.In the United States, residential investment is about 4 percent of total economic activity in normal times, and about 3 percent lately. But it experiences far more extreme ups and downs than the economy as a whole, especially over the last decade. Spending on food and beverages is a larger share of the overall economy, but you never hear of a recession being triggered by a downturn in the grocery store and restaurant industries. In 2008, overall G.D.P. fell 2.8 percent. Residential investment fell 24.3 percent.But that\u2019s only part of the reason housing is so important to economic cycles despite its relatively small size. A home is not just something people consume; it is also in many cases their largest asset. So swings in home prices can change individual\u2019s perceptions of their wealth (and hence their spending on everything else).But even though housing plays a huge role in the ups and downs of economic cycles, it has too often been an afterthought for the people charged with setting economic policy. To them, it is just one of many important industries, no more and no less. You see hints of this, for example, in transcripts of Federal Reserve policy meetings from 2006 and 2007, when many officials were analyzing the decline in home prices and building activity that was under way through a narrow lens that made them unable to see how widely the damage could ripple.There is decent evidence that a number of other countries are experiencing new housing bubbles \u2014 mostly, advanced nations that skirted the worst of the last downturn like Canada, Germany, Australia and the Nordic countries. But even seven years after housing was at the root of a global crisis, there are still no solid answers as to what exactly constitutes an economic risk and how policy can combat it.Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, also announced a new cap on mortgages. A British bank can\u2019t issue any more than 15 percent of its mortgage portfolio to buyers who are taking on debt of more than 4.5 times their income.These are baby steps. The evidence of whether economic policy makers have really learned anything about how to avoid the boom-bust cycle in housing that brings the rest of the economy along with it will come with the next downturn. But in the meantime, the research by the I.M.F. and action by the Bank of England are early and important examples that American officials will want to study closely as they try to figure out how to rein in the kind of boom-bust cycle that has had such lasting consequences.Advertisement"}

Those in the highest ranks remain loyal to Mr. Bashir. They are from the same elite, and benefit from the privileges conferred on the president\u2019s inner circle. Their fate is tied to his.In contrast to the army, the janjaweed has proved a reliable machine of terror with little capacity or ambition to rule. It has no prominent political leaders or educated cadres; it remains mostly a group of fighters for hire, unlikely to challenge Mr. Bashir\u2019s leadership.In May of last year, the newly formed R.S.F. was instrumental in rebuffing an attack on the city of Umm Ruwaba in southern Sudan by the Sudan Revolutionary Front, a rebel coalition from Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile. With the insurgents less than 200 miles from Khartoum, and his official army proving reluctant to fight, Mr. Bashir used the former janjaweed forces to check the rebels\u2019 advance.These moves, which were an attempt to create a counterweight to the army and intimidate political opponents, have complicated Sudan\u2019s national crisis. They have alienated opposition parties that seek a peaceful solution, while insulting and provoking regular army officers.Showing no more than a rhetorical commitment to national political dialogue, Mr. Bashir appears to believe that he can continue to rule by force, using the janjaweed as a mercenary army. But he has miscalculated: Without peace and greater political unity, Sudan is economically nonviable and destined to become ever more divided and lawless.There is a common interest in putting Sudan on a path to prosperity. And a wider regional stability, including oil-producing South Sudan, is also at stake. Rather than turning a blind eye to Mr. Bashir\u2019s remobilization of the janjaweed, Khartoum\u2019s friends among African states and allies like China, Russia and Qatar need to use their leverage \u2014 if necessary, through an internationally managed regional conference \u2014 to bring about a political transition. This means addressing the grievances of Sudan\u2019s periphery and ending Khartoum\u2019s piecemeal approach to the country\u2019s conflicts. It also means insisting upon the decade-old Security Council resolution that the janjaweed be disarmed, once and for all.Advertisement"}

But state agencies have not consulted with him on such climate change data, he said. \u201cGiven that climate change has been politicized across the board , it doesn\u2019t surprise me at all,\u201d said Dr. Nielsen-Gammon, who was appointed by Gov. George W. Bush in 2000.Mr. Averitt, now a health and environmental consultant, said the tone of the climate change debate had radically shifted. \u201cUnfortunately, climate change is associated with a liberal agenda that most Republicans are initially going to reject,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite frankly, it was that simple and nonconstructive. You do your rhetoric, we\u2019re going to do our rhetoric, and in the meantime nothing gets done.\u201dTexas\u2019 economic and energy boom is likely another reason Republicans have strayed from climate science \u2014 the state\u2019s economy runs largely on the ability to emit significant quantities of greenhouse gases and to export fossil fuels around the world.For Larry Soward, a former close political associate of Mr. Perry\u2019s, the easy narrative of Texas\u2019 ascent fueled by business-friendly conservatism was too good to pass up for Mr. Perry as he prepared to run for president.\u201cWhen he made his run in the presidential race, he was totally negative towards environmental issues like greenhouse gases and climate change, and I think that was strictly because of the partisan politics necessary to get support,\u201d said Mr. Soward, whom Mr. Perry appointed to serve on the Texas commission from 2003 to 2007 and is now an environmental activist. Ms. Nashed, Mr. Perry\u2019s spokeswoman, said the governor was committed to protecting the environment by reducing other \u201cknown pollutants\u201d like nitrogen oxide but did not believe that greenhouse gases fell in the same category. nsatija@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

By way of comparison, two years before Mr. Romney\u2019s first presidential bid, in December 2006, 69 percent of Americans had no opinion of him.

A nationwide tour can build an up-to-date, geographically diverse network of supporters who are ready to knock on doors and make phone calls when the time comes. It gives people the chance to identify with the author and become part of the team. Similarly, selling books means that the data on people who buy them can be leveraged to target readers with direct appeals or to recruit more volunteers.

The answer centers on one of the biggest costs of a national book tour for someone who is as viable a presidential candidate as Mrs. Clinton is.People are not evaluating her for the party nomination; they are sizing her up as a president. They evaluate Mrs. Clinton on what they think life would be like under her presidency, but she\u2019s actually giving them very little domestic policy information to go on. In the absence of policy statements to guide the thought experiment about life under President Hillary Clinton, voters gravitate toward personal traits and characteristics \u2014 like how much money she and Bill Clinton have earned since leaving the White House.It\u2019s just like figuring out if you want to go on a date with someone you\u2019ve just met. You quickly extrapolate from observed personal traits, like weight, height or clothing, to unobserved personal traits like whether this person would be considerate, strong or relatable. In the political realm, the extrapolation goes one step farther, Mr. Popkin argues \u2014 from unobserved personal traits like compassion or loyalty to future job performance in the Oval Office.Voters are used to hearing candidates talk about what they want to do if elected. It\u2019s what a presidential candidate sounds like. Despite looking a lot like a candidate, Mrs. Clinton doesn\u2019t sound much like one at this stage, and that could be costly in the long run.There are, however, risks and rewards to both strategies. More policy discussions about what she would prioritize as president would surely deflate the strong, nonpartisan and statesmanlike narrative she tried to build as President Obama\u2019s secretary of state. It is not hard to understand why she would like to avoid that. But the absence of discussion of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s broader vision for America \u2014 and how she might achieve it \u2014 leaves people to fill in the blanks based on personal characteristics.Given the narrative so far, it is also not hard to understand why she would like to avoid that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeing a Supersize Yacht as a Job Engine, Not a Self-Indulgence", "Date": "2014-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersDENNIS M. JONES was struck by an intriguing coincidence when he took delivery of his custom-built 164-foot superyacht: The $34 million he paid for it was equal to the $34 million he had donated to charity since 2000. The contributions helped the neediest around St. Louis get an education, get healthy or get a fresh start.But the money spent on the yacht helped save the shipbuilder and the jobs of the hundreds of people it employed.Could the purchase of a such a yacht be more than an act of self-indulgence? Could it provide something as significant, Mr. Jones wondered, as the financial aid he has given to children, homeless people, drug addicts and groups that promote education and entrepreneurship?Mr. Jones, who made his fortune when he sold Jones Pharma, a niche drug company, to King Pharmaceuticals for $3.4 billion in 2000, is under no illusions that a superyacht is an essential item, even for someone in the 0.1 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate for people who want the ultimate.\u201dYet the yacht he purchased helped save Christensen Yachts, a 30-year-old American yacht builder, whose work force shrank to 75, from 500, after the financial collapse. Beyond improving the leisure time of one very successful man, the yacht Mr. Jones ordered added jobs for people being paid craftsmen wages.\u201cThe company is up and running better because of us,\u201d Mr. Jones said. Today, Christensen has a three-year waiting period for one of its yachts. When I heard about Mr. Jones\u2019s story, and his willingness to tell it, I was intrigued. Was he just a wealthy man trying to justify spending tens of millions of dollars on a new yacht?Or was he subtly challenging the billionaires who make a show of signing the Warren Buffett-Bill Gates pledge to give away most of their money to philanthropies during their lifetimes \u2014 those who seem almost embarrassed by the lifestyles funded by their enormous fortunes? Wealth is not something to be embarrassed by, Mr. Jones contends; in his view, people should be encouraged to seek it.Mr. Jones is unabashed about his lifestyle. It is one that could fairly be called lavish. He and his wife, Judy, live in a 31,000-square-foot mansion outside St. Louis. (According to property records, they pay more in property taxes than all but one person in St. Louis.) When they want to cruise on their new yacht, D\u2019Natalin IV, which will spend winters in the Caribbean and summers in Europe, they fly to it, and anywhere else they want to go, on a private jet.\u201cI retired at 62 after hitting an unbelievable home run, and now we have the great home, the great yacht and the method of getting there,\u201d Mr. Jones, 75, said. \u201cWherever we go, we have the same level of service.\u201d\u201cThe one theme throughout is education,\u201d Mr. Jones said of his charitable giving. \u201cI only have a high school degree. It didn\u2019t matter back then, but we have a different society today.\u201dMr. Jones said he wanted to encourage other wealthy people to think about how their opulent lifestyles could provide jobs just as their charity helps people in need. Which is where the 164-foot yacht comes in. After 15 years with a 151-foot Delta, which had room for 12 guests and 10 crew members, the Joneses wanted their own superyacht built from scratch. They chose Christensen Yachts, in Vancouver, Wash., because of its reputation for quality.What Mr. Jones didn\u2019t realize in early 2013 was how much Christensen Yachts was struggling from the recession. \u201cThere were only two other yachts plus ours being built,\u201d he said. Mr. Jones, who had employed 650 people at Jones Pharma and gave stock options to employees at all levels, liked the idea of his money providing jobs and maybe saving an American company.Joe F. Foggia, chief executive of Christensen Yachts, does not dispute Mr. Jones\u2019s recollection. His yacht order was a catalyst for others. \u201cWe had finished some boats, but the last one we delivered was in the latter part of 2010,\u201d he said.His business was so slow in 2013 that the company had reorganized itself and branched out into industries like manufacturing wind turbines and making smaller yachts that other companies would sell under their brand.\u201cBefore 2008, no one took any interest in what we were doing,\u201d he said of the residents of the city, which is just across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore. \u201cWhen we started laying people off, we were viewed as the rich man\u2019s toy box.\u201dThat changed when the economic impact of hundreds of jobless workers was felt in the businesses around the shipyard.\u201cNinety-plus percent of the contract price of $34 million goes into payroll, health care, American-made materials, goods, services, local and federal taxes,\u201d Mr. Foggia said. \u201cOne boat affects close to 1,000 households nationwide. There are 180 brand-new cars in our yard in the last 18 months.\u201dMr. Foggia noted that the flow of money kept going with a boat like D\u2019Natalin IV. \u201cIt costs $170,000 a month in crew, insurance, moorage, fuel and the crew buying all their things for the boat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant cash flow machine for the local economy whenever one of those things pulls in.\u201dMr. Jones\u2019s friend and financial adviser, Niall Gannon, said this might sound like trickle-down economics, but he considers it something different. \u201cI\u2019d call it \u2018fire hose economics\u2019 because the money left his account that fast,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s out of his account and in the accounts of these 200 people who worked on his yacht.\u201dThe yacht also has a full-time crew of 10. An experienced captain on a ship like this earns $200,000 a year, an engineer about $100,000 and the rest of the crew members can expect to earn from $40,000 to $50,000 \u2014 on top of living rent-free on the yacht, said Christian Bakewell, a broker in the superyacht division at Merle Wood & Associates, who oversaw the construction of Mr. Jones\u2019s yacht.\u201cPeople see the splashy images of Beyonc\u00e9 stepping on a yacht,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t see is how many people go into building that yacht and maintaining that yacht. Those things get missed, and people fall back to the one percent arguments.\u201dStill, some people may think Mr. Jones\u2019s purchase is excessive. But Ken Nopar, principal at Nopar Consulting, a philanthropic advisory that helps wealthy people give their money away, disagrees. \u201cIf people are spending money, it is creating jobs and providing a way of life,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with it. Without that type of spending there would be a lot more people in need of help from social service agencies.\u201dAnd Mr. Nopar pointed out that there was still charitable value in D\u2019Natalin IV: If Mr. Jones tires of it, he can give it to a donor-advised fund, which would sell it and give the money away. In doing so, he would get a break on estate taxes.For now, Mr. Jones is eager to use his yacht. The maiden voyage lasted 29 days. The next trip is to the Panama Canal with his entire family at Christmas. After that, he plans to open it up to friends, as he has done with previous yachts.\u201cAll of our friends on our yacht have been friends well before Jones Pharma was ever started,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are regular working folks just like I was. Having them share in our lifestyle is a way of giving only second to giving to others.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Myanmar, the Euphoria of Reform Loses Its Glow", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 Three years after Myanmar\u2019s ruling generals shed their uniforms and propelled the country on an ambitious journey toward democracy, security forces are back on the streets of the former military dictatorship.A rampage by radical Buddhists in the sprawling city of Mandalay that left two people dead this week spurred the authorities to declare a nighttime curfew, dispatch hundreds of riot police officers and erect razor wire around the Muslim neighborhoods that were attacked.The violence raised fears that the rioting that has hit provincial towns in the past two years might now spill over into Myanmar\u2019s most populous and important cities. It was also yet another in a string of disappointments that have worn away at the euphoria that greeted the end of five dark decades of military rule. Among the most worrisome setbacks are the attacks in western Myanmar on an ethnic minority called the Rohingya, an apparent rollback of some press freedoms and tepid commitments by foreign investors who are crucial to building the nation\u2019s impoverished economy.Both critics and supporters of the government agree that changes over the past three years have made Myanmar profoundly more open and free than the cloistered, brutally repressive country that it was under military rule. But whereas two years ago the government was tightly focused on writing a foreign investment law, releasing political prisoners and abolishing strict censorship, critics say religious politicking is both distracting leaders from reforms and poisoning some of the good will that President Thein Sein, a former general, had when he began the liberalization effort in 2011.One of the highest-profile proposals of his administration this year is a series of divisive measures to \u201cprotect\u201d Buddhism that have drawn outrage from interfaith groups. The proposed laws \u2014 pushed by a radical Buddhist movement blamed by many for instigating violence against Muslims \u2014 would restrict religious conversions and require women to obtain permission before marrying outside their religion.\u201cLiberalization is over,\u201d said Daw Zin Mar Aung, a women\u2019s rights activist who has received death threats for her opposition to the bills. \u201cWhy would the president submit such radical laws?\u201dMs. Zin Mar Aung, who like many civic leaders in the country is a former political prisoner, accuses the government of building a new national identity on the basis of nationalism and Buddhist chauvinism rather than a multicultural democracy.The backsliding on press freedoms has been directly related, at least in one case, to the Buddhist-Muslim violence that has led to more than 250 deaths. In that case, a correspondent for Time magazine was barred from the country after writing an article on the radical Buddhist movement.Foreign journalists have seen the duration of their visas cut, and in February, journalists were jailed under a British colonial law, the State Secrets Act, for reporting on what they claimed was a chemical weapons facility. David Scott Mathieson, a Myanmar expert with Human Rights Watch, said the police last month \u201creverted to their old intimidation tactics\u201d when they called in journalists and editors of several publications for questioning. The reason given was concern over potential money laundering, \u201cbut more obviously it was a subtle form of pressure to curb the confidence of the Burmese media,\u201d Mr. Mathieson said.In an attempt to explain what many call a \u201cpause\u201d in reforms, Romain Caillaud, the managing director in Myanmar of Vriens & Partners, a consultancy, said he sensed more caution from the still-powerful military establishment and a belief that \u201cit\u2019s too early to let go of the reins.\u201d\u201cWe were all a bit na\u00efve about how far things could go,\u201d Mr. Caillaud said. \u201cThey have done a lot, and they are not that comfortable going much further right now.\u201dThe economic changes pushed by the new government are considered a critical complement to the political freedoms that have been introduced. For decades, Myanmar\u2019s poverty-stricken economy was largely state-controlled and disconnected from the outside world.But the welcome mat laid out for foreign investors three years ago has failed to produce the rush of foreign companies that many anticipated, and foreign businesses are encountering high levels of corruption, a dysfunctional bureaucracy and infrastructure that remains among the most primitive in AsiaThe wariness is evident at Thilawa, an area outside of the country\u2019s largest city, Yangon, that is being developed into an industrial zone.The blueprints call for a collection of factories, a showcase for the new Myanmar that would employ thousands of workers. But there are still more water buffalo than construction workers in the future industrial zone. The architects of the reform process \u2014 ex-generals of the former junta \u2014 are among the critics of the slow pace of the economic transformation. \u201cI would say our economic reforms have not reached the level we expected,\u201d Thura Shwe Mann, the speaker of the lower house of Parliament and the chairman of the governing party, said in an interview.A spokesman for President Thein Sein complained in a separate interview that too few investors \u201care coming with big money.\u201d U Ye Htut, the spokesman, added, \u201cThe president\u2019s concern is that economic dividends have failed to reach the grass-roots level.\u201dThe disappointing levels of foreign investment are a blow to the governing party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, which was created by the former junta. The party was counting on job creation to help it overcome what many consider the long odds of beating the National League for Democracy, the party of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate, in landmark elections due to be called next year.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi offered a measure of legitimacy to the fledgling democracy and its reform process when she joined Parliament and cultivated warmer relations with the military.But the honeymoon between Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and the military that jailed her for the better part of two decades now appears to be soured by the refusal of Parliament \u2014 where the military is allotted one-quarter of seats \u2014 to change a law that bars her from becoming president. She has begun to battle to curtail the military\u2019s political power. Last month in the provincial city of Taunggu, she told a crowd of supporters that the military is \u201ctaking rights they do not deserve.\u201d Despite the three years of a nominally civilian government, the military\u2019s privileges and economic clout have remained largely intact.\u201cThey own everything: land, companies, export licenses,\u201d said U Win Htein, a former officer who is now an opposition member of Parliament. \u201cYou name it, they have it.\u201dAnd almost without exception, the top posts in Myanmar\u2019s government today are held by former military officers.\u201cIt really seems like a military government in civilian clothing,\u201d said Sean Turnell, one of the leading experts on the Burmese economy.Yet at a time of failed and bloodstained democratic revolutions in the Middle East, some say the military\u2019s continued engagement in politics in Myanmar ensures a measure of stability.\u201cThis is a top-down, managed transition,\u201d said Richard Horsey, a former United Nations official and one of the country\u2019s leading political analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason why it may be more sustainable and successful than, say, the Arab Spring.\u201dThat reform process may be partly maintained by competition between former generals in elections.Still, there are fears that the upcoming election might also come with negatives, possibly exacerbating religious tensions, especially if the governing party tries to harness the popularity of the radical Buddhist movement.U Nyi Nyi, a Muslim tea shop owner, said Muslims had very little trust in the police force, which is overwhelmingly staffed by Buddhists, after it failed to stop massacres of Muslims in Meikthila and other towns and cities over the past two years.After the violence in his neighborhood this week, police seized sticks and swords from Muslim houses. But they did not disarm the crowd of Buddhist attackers, Mr. Nyi Nyi said.\u201cHow will we protect ourselves if we are attacked?\u201d he said.Thomas Fuller reported from Naypyidaw; Yangon, Myanmar; and Bangkok.

{"Headline": "Eurozone Must Brace for New Shocks", "Date": "2014-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyEurozone policy makers may feel they can afford to relax this summer. That would be a terrible error. The euro crisis is sleeping, not dead.The region is suffering from stagnation, low inflation, unemployment and debt. The crisis could easily revive because the eurozone is not well placed to withstand a shock.What is more, it is not hard to see from where such a blow could come. Relations with Russia have rapidly deteriorated since the downing of a Malaysia Airlines flight over Ukraine. If Europe imposes sanctions that make Moscow think again, these will hurt Europe, too.The eurozone needs to take measures to insure itself against disaster: looser monetary policy by the European Central Bank to increase inflation; a new drive for structural reforms, especially in France and Italy but also in Germany; and some loosening of budgetary straitjackets.First, though, look at the problem. Financial markets have been relatively calm for two years since Mario Draghi, the E.C.B.\u2019s president, said he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro. But the eurozone is barely growing. The International Monetary Fund predicted on July 14 that it would record growth of little more than 1 percent this year. That is a pathetic rebound, given the recession\u2019s severity.There are, admittedly, some bright spots. Spain is enjoying a moderate recovery, largely as a result of effectively having implemented root-and-branch overhauls of its labor market and banking system. Even Greece seems to be on the road back from Hades.But the large economies are not doing well. Italy will grow only 0.3 percent this year, according to the I.M.F.; France will creep along at 0.7 percent.Germany will do better, at 1.9 percent, but even the German engine seems to be losing momentum. The Ifo index of German business sentiment declined for the third consecutive month in July.Meanwhile, eurozone inflation is 0.5 percent \u2014 well below the E.C.B.\u2019s target of close to 2 percent. Such a low figure has two bad consequences. It is helping keep the euro strong, which harms the prospects for exporters, and it makes debt burdens harder to bear.Italy\u2019s debt, which is expected by the European Commission to reach 135 percent of G.D.P. this year, is the most worrying. Unless growth and inflation go up, its borrowings are not sustainable. Given that Italy\u2019s debt is 2.1 trillion euros, or about $2.8 trillion, the repercussions of its getting into trouble would be horrendous. Italy needs to step up its privatization plans to head off fears that its debt could spiral out of control.Some eurozone politicians, especially from France, seem to think that the solution is to loosen both monetary and fiscal policy. Yes, sort of.Now that interest rates cannot fall further, the E.C.B. certainly needs to introduce a determined program of quantitative easing \u2014 the buying up of assets with newly created money. Given the undeveloped state of much of the eurozone\u2019s capital markets, this means buying government bonds in large quantities. There would be two benefits: Inflation would go up and the exchange rate would fall.There is also a strong case for the European Commission to give those countries that are engaged in serious structural overhauls extra time to hit their deficit targets. Such an approach has worked well with Spain, which was twice given more budgetary leeway during its program. But even when extra time is justified, this should be used to avoid tax increases rather than to let up on cuts in public spending.What is more, a program relying solely on looser monetary and fiscal policy would be more damaging than helpful. It would take the pressure off governments to change. A resurgence of the crisis would be probably delayed not prevented. And when it returned, it would do so with a vengeance.The biggest worry is France. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France has done too little to rein in public spending or liberalize labor markets. His newish prime minister, Manuel Valls, is trying to overhaul the economy but lacks whole-hearted support from his president, the Socialist Party and the country. At least Italy knows it has to change and has a prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who is determined to bring this about.Mr. Hollande now wants to install Pierre Moscovici, his former finance minister, as the European Commission\u2019s new economic commissioner. Given the need to keep the pressure on Paris, it would be a mistake to make a poacher one of the gamekeepers.By contrast, the idea of making Luis De Guindos the new head of the Eurogroup, which brings together the zone\u2019s finance ministers, is a good one. Spain\u2019s finance minister is in a perfect position to explain to his colleagues the value of structural overhauls, because they have worked so well in his country.This lesson is something Germany, too, could take to heart. Although Berlin revamped its labor market early in the century, it has since been resting on its laurels. The priority is to free up its services markets. This would have the double benefit of giving more choice to German consumers and opening up its markets to suppliers from other European countries, therefore increasing the countries\u2019 growth.If governments are prepared to fast-track structural overhauls, it is not just the European Commission that should be willing to give those that need it extra time to curb their deficits. The E.C.B. should also be happier to introduce quantitative easing. Policy makers should use the summer holidays to agree on a pact containing these three elements.Hugo Dixon is editor at large of Reuters News.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of Italy's debt. It is about $2.8 trillion, not $2.8 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France and the Loss of Greatness", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorApril was the cruelest month for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. The French president, battered by abysmal poll ratings, traveled to the southwestern town of Carmaux to commune with the spirit of its native son, Jean Jaur\u00e8s, the founder of France\u2019s Socialist Party, titanic tribune of the people and tireless defender of the values of 1789.Desperate to save his own political hide, Mr. Hollande hoped he would somehow profit by identifying publicly with the man who ever since his assassination in 1914 \u2014 on the eve of the outbreak of the catastrophic war that he had fought so hard to prevent \u2014 has become a modern icon of French greatness, perhaps second only to Charles de Gaulle.But if it were a miracle he sought, Mr. Hollande would have been better advised to visit nearby Lourdes. Though the police had cordoned off Carmaux\u2019s center, Mr. Hollande (who has achieved the distinction of having the lowest ratings of any French president since de Gaulle formed the Fifth Republic) was not spared the wrath of its residents. Boos and hisses sizzled from the crowd. One resident raked him over the coals \u2014 once this depressed town\u2019s principal industry \u2014 for his unfulfilled promises to revive the economy and battle unemployment. Mr. Hollande\u2019s irresolution and indecisiveness, others shouted, would make le grand Jaur\u00e8s turn over in his grave.Would it, in fact, have been surprising if the angry citizens of Carmaux felt seismic rumbles coming from the depths of the Pantheon, where the earthly remains of Jaur\u00e8s now lie? As France marks, on Thursday, the centennial of his assassination, we can measure not just the decline of the political party launched by this remarkable man, but also the decay of the republican ideals he embodied.As a parliamentary deputy at the end of the 19th century, Jaur\u00e8s won fame in wielding his fierce eloquence on behalf of the oppressed miners from his native region. But when the Dreyfus Affair enveloped France, Jaur\u00e8s grasped that oppression was not the lot of workers alone. Fellow Socialists had dismissed the affair as immaterial to the all too material and political concerns of workers. Yet Jaur\u00e8s corrected them, and corrected the course of history, by yoking the Jewish officer\u2019s case to his nation\u2019s revolutionary and universal values: liberty, equality and fraternity. The persecution of Dreyfus, Jaur\u00e8s declared, stripped the man of his social and economic particularities: \u201cHe is nothing less than mankind itself in the deepest pit of despair.\u201dThe generous humanism that spurred Jaur\u00e8s to mobilize his followers on Dreyfus\u2019s behalf also fueled his denunciations of European imperialism and nationalism. With great lucidity and logic, he saw these twinned ideologies leading to war; with great conviction and courage, he devoted the last years of his life to combating these evils. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Jaur\u00e8s shuttled between Germany, Belgium and Holland, working feverishly with other Socialist parties. Should war come, Jaur\u00e8s argued, the workers must not. By brandishing the threat of a general strike, he believed Europe\u2019s political leaders would refrain from plunging the Continent into war. Vilified as a traitor, Jaur\u00e8s lived under shadow of dozens of death threats.Ultimately, his hopes for worker solidarity were illusory, while the menaces of death were all too real. Months before he was shot and killed by a rabid nationalist, Jaur\u00e8s spoke at the funeral of a friend and prominent human rights advocate, Francis de Pressens\u00e9. There are no recordings of his voice, but we can still see and hear Jaur\u00e8s thanks to drawings and photographs. Imagine him with his arms stretching toward his listeners, then reaching toward the sky, his barrel chest jutted out and eyes bright with optimism: \u201cToday you\u2019re told: Act, always act! But what is action without thought? It is the barbarism born of inertia. You are told: brush aside the party of peace; it saps your courage! But I tell you that to stand for peace today is to wage the most heroic of battles.\u201dThe last and greatest hope to prevent the war disappeared on July 31. At 9:40 that night, on the terrace of the Caf\u00e9 du Croissant in Paris, a disheveled youth named Raoul Villain approached a group of men seated at a table, pulled a pistol from his pocket and fired two shots at Jaur\u00e8s. The massive and bearded bull of a man slumped to the ground.The headlines announcing his death stunned the nation: \u201cThey\u2019ve killed Jaur\u00e8s!\u201d Suddenly, a war that seemed imminent was now ineluctable. No less important, a certain idea of politics, one committed to an optimistic and generous understanding of France, also seemed to die. Jaur\u00e8s marked his era not just by his public oratory and intellect, but also by his personal integrity. Not only was he untainted by financial shenanigans and corruption, but his moral ideals and political actions almost always meshed, while his private life was no less exemplary than his public persona.In a profound sense, Jaur\u00e8s holds the same role in French history as de Gaulle does. (Not surprisingly, the general and the Socialist each have over 2,000 boulevards and streets named after them in France.) While de Gaulle renewed the French Right, and Jaur\u00e8s reshaped the French Left, both collapse simple political or ideological categories. Both were physical giants, as they were in their capacity to embody their nation\u2019s ideals.Tellingly, French politicians across the ideological spectrum invoke the names of both Jaur\u00e8s and de Gaulle \u2014 a measure of their greatness, of course, but also the smallness of their descendants. Not only have Mr. Hollande and former President Nicolas Sarkozy engaged in this form of hijacking, but so, too, has Marine Le Pen of the National Front (F.N.), who dismissed the Gaullist Union for a Popular Movement (U.M.P.) for \u201cbetraying\u201d its founder\u2019s vision for France, all the while comparing herself to the general who, like her, was distrusted by the Left and Right. At the same time, Steeve Briois, F.N. mayor of H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, cited Jaur\u00e8s during his campaign, while for Ms. Le Pen\u2019s second-in-command (and partner), Louis Aliot, Jaur\u00e8s would now vote for the F.N.These various appropriations are as lamentable as they are inevitable. Every politician wants to latch onto Jaur\u00e8s\u2019s massive presence, if only because they themselves are so weightless. In different, yet equally consequential ways, both Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande have shrunk the grandeur of their office. Overwhelmed by the charges of corruption brought against Mr. Sarkozy, underwhelmed by the romantic dalliances of Mr. Hollande, the French do not know where to turn, or perhaps they do: An increasing number of French people consider Marine Le Pen as a potential leader. France now faces the possibility of electing as its next president, to paraphrase Karl Kraus, the disease for which she pretends to be the cure.At Carmaux, Mr. Hollande insisted that Jaur\u00e8s had always understood the \u201cresistance of reality\u201d \u2014 namely, the need to acknowledge political and material facts. But he neglected to add that Jaur\u00e8s always insisted that while such resistance existed, we must always hold fast to our ideals. One hundred years later, many French citizens, deprived of such ideals by their political leaders, may well wonder if the resistance of reality has carried the day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Top Properties in Hong Kong Housing Resist Market Forces", "Date": "2014-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetHONG KONG \u2014 When the Opus project was unveiled in 2012, its developer boasted that the apartments there, designed by the star architect Frank Gehry, would be the most expensive in Hong Kong \u2014 and, by extension, probably the world.Last year, the government sought to cool the market with tighter mortgage rules and a higher tax aimed at some high-end buyers from outside Hong Kong. Still, at the beginning of this month, Swire announced that another Opus unit had sold for $55.5 million. The buyer was apparently local.The sale illustrated how seemingly bulletproof Hong Kong\u2019s superluxury housing market is, experts say. Prices have remained roughly the same even as the number of transactions has dropped, showing that developers and rich owners are happy to hang on to prized properties \u2014 even empty ones \u2014 as the rest of the market dips.\u201cThey have holding power,\u201d Thomas Lam, head of valuation and consulting at the real estate service provider Knight Frank Hong Kong, said of wealthy investors. \u201cFor them, the holding costs are relatively low, and they don\u2019t need the rent. They can keep it empty. High-net-worth individuals already have other homes.\u201dBut the penthouse is not for sale. According to a Henderson spokeswoman, Gabriella Chow, the home is empty and owned by the developers.For all the hoopla surrounding Opus when it opened two years ago, it remains partly empty. Of the nine remaining units that Swire holds, five are leased, three are available for rent and one is being held by the company, according to Lydia Tsui, a company spokeswoman.With Opus, Swire used a bidding system to avoid having to disclose a full price list, which would otherwise be required under a 2013 ordinance to prevent backdoor dealings. Rather than list the units on the market, the company collected sealed offers from prospective buyers.The government does not have statistics on how many privately held properties are empty. But some newer luxury towers in popular districts like West Kowloon are dotted with undressed windows and empty living rooms.The Hong Kong government has often faced criticism for policies that make homes unaffordable for average families, and it is trying to create more housing stock, which could bring prices down in sectors other than superluxury apartments. The government and the MTR Corporation \u2014 a government-linked company that is both the city\u2019s subway operator and a major property developer \u2014 announced last month the release of five new sites that could provide room for 2,100 apartments. Almost all land in Hong Kong is owned by the government but leased out for private use.\u201cIn most property sectors, values have either stabilized or come down,\u201d said Simon Smith, head of Asia-Pacific research for Savills, a real estate company based in London. \u201cPrices across the board are off 5 to 10 percent since 2013. And the volume of transactions has come down even more heavily.\u201dAccording to analysts, about half of the purchases at popular luxury developments were by mainland Chinese before the 2013 cooling measures. \u201cIt\u2019s a desire to get money out of China, where people have accumulated vast wealth, but there is only so much room for investment,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cAnd Hong Kong real estate has always been a safe haven.\u201dIn that regard, Hong Kong is most often compared with London, but with a different clientele.\u201cIn the case of London, you have a much more international buyer demographic,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cOverseas buyers in Hong Kong tend to be mainlanders, and not so much the Arabs, Russians and Europeans.\u201d\u201cWith the government measures in place, new supply on the way and rates set to rise,\u201d Mr. Smith said, \u201cyou will see a further correction in prices eventually.\u201dOpus and 39 Conduit Road are on streets that curve up to The Peak, a high-priced enclave overlooking the rest of Hong Kong Island that is the center of the superluxury world. But less prominent property developments are spreading across the Kowloon Peninsula, and farther afield to the mostly rural New Territories.On a busy Saturday in June, four luxury developments in Kowloon and the New Territories simultaneously put more than 600 apartments on the market. There were lines of potential buyers outside the buildings, followed by eager agents waving glossy brochures and business cards.One of the four is the Grand Austin, under construction in West Kowloon. The area is choked with dust, noise and congestion because of two government projects: a high-speed rail terminal that will connect to mainland China and the yet-unbuilt West Kowloon Cultural District. The thinking is that home prices will jump once rich mainland Chinese can commute directly to a complex with shiny new museums and theaters.\u201cIf you look at future housing supply, only 10 percent will be on Hong Kong Island, 15 percent in Kowloon and 75 percent in the New Territories,\u201d said Mr. Lam, of Knight Frank Hong Kong.When asked whether unrest could rock superluxury housing, Mr. Lam said, \u201cNot unless there are effects to the larger economy or stock market.\u201d\u201cThis is Hong Kong,\u201d he added, a few days after the protest. \u201cLife goes on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Will Stand Up for Hong Kong?", "Date": "2014-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSeventeen years after the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China, the political future of the territory hangs in the balance. The city can continue down a path that will lead to a fully democratic political system, or Beijing can thwart its democratic development and eventually run Hong Kong like just another Chinese city.All signs indicate that Beijing plans to tighten its grip. As increasingly restive Hong Kongers protest this summer against Beijing\u2019s interference, the international community, particularly Britain, the former colonial power, has a moral and legal obligation to support their will for democracy and autonomy. London should demand that Beijing live up to its agreements and back off.On July 1st, an estimated half a million people took to the Hong Kong streets to protest Beijing\u2019s meddling. In the days before, nearly 800,000 Hong Kongers participated in an informal vote run by a pro-democracy group in support of electing the city\u2019s next leader by democratic means, a prospect Beijing has all but ruled out.In recent months, the Chinese government has made clear that it intends to renege on a promise to allow Hong Kongers \u201cuniversal suffrage\u201d to freely elect their next leader by insisting Beijing must vet the candidates for \u201cpatriotism.\u201d But it was the release in June of a strongly worded policy paper in which Beijing claimed ultimate authority over Hong Kong that galvanized locals against the mainland\u2019s interference.The so-called white paper says the \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d Hong Kong was promised in the 1984 Joint Declaration \u2014 signed by Britain and China when Beijing was trying to assure the world it would leave Hong Kong alone after the end of British colonial rule \u2014 is not \u201cfull autonomy.\u201d In blatant disregard of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s signature on the Joint Declaration, the white paper claims that Beijing can interpret Hong Kong law as it sees fit. The territory\u2019s autonomy, the paper says, derives \u201csolely from the authorization of the central leadership.\u201dPerhaps most troubling, the document likens Beijing\u2019s authority over Hong Kong to how it rules other autonomous regions in China \u2014 a worrying prospect for anyone familiar with how the leadership treats the people of Tibet and Xinjiang.The situation should not be this bleak. As early as 1979, in meetings with British officials, Deng Xiaoping said Hong Kongers should \u201cput their hearts at ease\u201d about Chinese rule. The Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, largely fulfilled the legal commitments made in the Joint Declaration. Hong Kong courts were authorized to interpret the Basic Law within the scope of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, while foreign affairs and defense were to be handled by Beijing. Most importantly, \u201cuniversal suffrage\u201d was to be implemented.Now, the white paper refers to Hong Kong\u2019s judges as \u201cadministrators\u201d and emphasizes their role in guarding national security.Cracks appeared soon after the handover. First, the National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee effectively overturned a 1999 decision by Hong Kong\u2019s highest court in a case about local residency rights, raising great concern about Hong Kong\u2019s judicial independence. Later, Beijing made central government approval a requirement for any reforms to the Legislative Council election process. And over the past decade the subservient Hong Kong government has tried to push through unpopular national security laws and policies on patriotic education (all abandoned in the face of mass public protests). Meanwhile, a form of crony capitalism is widely thought to be creeping across the border.Still, Beijing finally agreed in 2007 to allow universal suffrage to elect the chief executive in 2017. Yet in the last year Beijing has insisted that nominees must \u201clove China and love Hong Kong\u201d \u2014 language that is code to exclude the democrats. Locals feel they have no other choice but to take the cause of democracy to the streets.The group Occupy Central with Love and Peace has threatened a mass act of civil disobedience in the Central financial district if the government does not put forth fair democracy proposals that meet international standards. To show support for its position, Occupy Central organized last month\u2019s vote in which citizens were asked to choose from three democratic proposals for nominating chief executive candidates. The next protest, its organizers say, could happen as early as August if government proposals, due out this week, aim to block real democratic reform.A special onus falls on Britain, whose flag some Hong Kongers waved during the July 1 demonstrations. One can only wonder if Prime Minister David Cameron, who recently signed a group of major trade deals with China during Prime Minister Li Keqiang\u2019s visit to London, will ever weigh in to uphold his country\u2019s commitment to Hong Kong\u2019s people. He should consider the words of his predecessor, John Major, who sought to assure a wary world before Hong Kong was handed over to the Chinese.\u201cIf in the future there were any suggestion of a breach of the Joint Declaration, we would mobilize the international community and pursue every legal or other avenue open to us,\u201d Prime Minister Major said back in 1996, a year before the handover. It\u2019s clear that time has come. Michael C. Davis is a law professor at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in constitutional development and human rights.Advertisement"}

These Western powers have involved themselves in a variety of ways to promote peace and have secured the trust, for the most part, of both sides.

They alone should set the parameters for a peace agreement and impose them on the parties. The leaders of Israel, Fatah and Hamas are bound to complain that the rest of the world has no right to impose conditions that they themselves have not proposed, but they will have to accede to these conditions in the same way that the rest of the world acceded to the creation of Israel once the United Nations voted it into existence.

{"Headline": "Influx of South Americans Drives Miami\u2019s Reinvention", "Date": "2014-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 As the World Cup played out over the past month, yellow-clad Colombians packed the Kukaramakara nightclub downtown, Aguila beers in hand, shouting, \u201cColombia, Colombia!\u201d Outside, Brazilians in car caravans blasted samba music. Argentines, some in blue-and-white striped jerseys, jammed into nearby steakhouses and empanada joints. Around town, children filed into Sunday Mass, their jerseys ablaze with their futbol heroes from across Latin America.It was less a commentary on soccer than a tableau vivant of the new Miami, which has gone from a place defined by Cuban-Americans to one increasingly turbocharged by a surge of well-educated, well-off South Americans in the last decade. Their growing numbers and influence, both as immigrants and as visitors, have transformed Miami\u2019s once recession-dampened downtown, enriched its culture and magnified its allure for businesses around the world as a crossroads of the Spanish-speaking world.\u201cIt\u2019s now the indisputable capital of Latin America,\u201d said Marcelo Claure, a Bolivian millionaire who founded Brightstar, a global wireless distribution company based here. \u201cThe Latin economic boom in the last 10 years has led to the creation of a huge middle class in countries like Brazil, Peru and Colombia, and they look at Miami as the aspirational place to be.\u201d The transformation, the latest chapter in the city\u2019s decades-long evolution, is especially apparent amid the building cranes, street life and nightclubs downtown. But it is seen across Miami-Dade County, where highly educated South American immigrants and second-home owners have increasingly put down roots and played a major role in jump-starting a region that not long ago was ravaged by recession.Their relative wealth has allowed them to ramp up businesses like import-export companies and banks, and to open restaurants that dish out arepas from Venezuela, coxinhas from Brazil and alfajores from Argentina. Partly as a result of that influx, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale region eclipsed Los Angeles in 2012 as the major metropolitan area with the largest share \u2014 45 percent \u2014 of immigrant business owners, according to a report by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group.The South American presence has also reshaped politics and radio here. More moderate than traditional Cuban-Americans, South Americans have nudged local politics toward the center. Radio stations no longer cater exclusively to Cuban audiences; they feature more news about Latin America and less anti-Castro fulminating.Last week, Charlie Crist, who is running for governor as a Democrat, named a Colombian-American woman from Miami, Annette Taddeo-Goldstein, as his running mate.Colombians, who first began to settle here in the 1980s, are the largest group of South Americans. They now make up nearly 5 percent of Miami-Dade\u2019s population. They are joined by Argentines, Peruvians and a growing number of Venezuelans. Brazilians, relative newcomers to Miami\u2019s Hispanic hodgepodge, are now a distinct presence as well. The Venezuelan population jumped 117 percent over 10 years, a number that does not capture the surge in recent arrivals. Over half of Miami\u2019s residents are foreign born, and 63 percent speak Spanish at home.The influx is expanding the borders of immigrant neighborhoods in places like West Kendall, the Hammocks and Doral. Their numbers are growing across the county line into Broward, where one city, Weston, has gained so many Venezuelans that it is jokingly called Westonzuela.Jorge P\u00e9rez, the wealthy real estate developer for whom the the new P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami is named, said the latest surge of South Americans was turning the city into a year-round destination and luring more entrepreneurs and international businesses. Latin American banks have proliferated as they follow their customers here.Most noticeably, they are snapping up real estate in Miami, Miami Beach and Key Biscayne, a wealthy island two bridges away from Miami. Real estate developers credit South Americans for spurring the current housing boom.\u201cSouth Americans are the game changers \u2014 they are the ones that allowed the housing market to bounce back,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez said.Cubans still dominate Miami, making up just over half the number of Hispanics and a third of the total population, and Central Americans have flocked here for decades. But in an area where Hispanics have gone from 23 percent of the population in 1970 to 65 percent now, what is most striking is the deepening influence of South Americans.Many came here to flee a political crisis, as the Venezuelans did after the presidential election of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 1998 and then his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, or to escape turbulent economies, as the Argentines and Colombians did more than a decade ago.But the latest wave of South Americans adds a new twist. It includes many nonimmigrants \u2014 investors on the lookout for businesses and properties, including second homes in Miami and Miami Beach. For them, Miami is an increasingly alluring place to safely keep money and stay for extended periods.Spanish, which has long been the common language in much of Miami, now dominates even broader sections of the city. In stores, banks, gyms and even boardrooms in much of Miami, Spanish is the default language.The effect on real estate is especially visible in the Brickell area, Miami\u2019s international banking center, and in once-bedraggled parts of downtown. The South American infatuation with urban living has led to the explosion of lavish new condominium towers, with more to come. There is even rooftop soccer, like the kind offered in South America. Last year, David Beckham and Mr. Claure announced that they would bring a Major League Soccer team to Miami, though they are still in negotiations for a suitable stadium site.Sit in a restaurant and you hear a range of accents \u2014 the lilt of Argentine patter, the clarity of Colombian Spanish, the liveliness of Venezuelans and the speedy rat-a-tat of Cubans. Brazilians have sprinkled Portuguese into the mix.The flurry of condo construction now rivals the one before the 2008 crash, raising the specter for some housing analysts of another risky housing bubble.\u201cStatus is having a condo in Miami,\u201d said Juan C. Zapata, the first Colombian to serve as a Miami-Dade County commissioner and, before then, in the State Legislature.The suburbs, too, continue to swell as more South Americans move into areas anchored by people from their countries. Doral, a middle-class city near the airport, is now a panoply of South Americans, most of them Venezuelans. Eighty percent of Doral is Hispanic, and in 2012, a Venezuelan, Luigi Boria, was elected mayor.\u201cEvery year, we get more and more Venezuelans,\u201d said Lorenzo Di Stefano, the owner of El Arepazo 2, a Venezuelan restaurant there. This year, with the economy worsening in Venezuela, Mr. Di Stefano said he expected another large wave.But, Mr. Crist\u2019s running mate and Mr. Boria aside, the South American influx has not translated into widespread electoral success. South Americans lag far behind Cuban-Americans in political power, in part because their citizenship rate is lower. Many do not vote or run for office, a reality that Mr. Zapata said must change.\u201cWhat you see in Miami is a change economically; it\u2019s much more diverse than it used to be,\u201d Mr. Zapata said. \u201cBut the Cubans grew economically, and turned it into political power.\u201dThat transformation, Mr. Zapata said, will be Miami\u2019s next chapter.Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the effect an influx of South Americans is having on the reinvention of Miami misstated the relationship of the wealthy real estate developer Jorge P\u00e9rez to the new P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami. The museum was named for Mr. P\u00e9rez; he is not its founder. The error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Number That Many French Businesses Fear", "Date": "2014-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u00c9GUILLES, France \u2014 Philippe Plantier, a seasoned French mountaineer, was rappelling down a cliff more than a decade ago when the inspiration struck: He could turn his passion for climbing into a business.Starting from his garage, he opened a small firm in the heart of Provence that now does a brisk local business on vertiginous industrial structures, with rappellers painting suspension bridges or belaying over mammoth nuclear cooling towers.There are few heights to which Mr. Plantier and his workers will not ascend. But there is one number he refuses to go above: 49.When his employee head count reached that figure, he stopped hiring. Taking on a 50th person would unleash nearly three dozen French labor regulations that he estimates would cause operating costs for his company, Travaux Grande Hauteur, to rise by about 4 percent. That could mean the difference between making and losing money, he says, in a business whose profit margins are as thin as his climbers\u2019 margin for error.So in a tactic used by hundreds of other employers in a country with some of the European Union\u2019s most extensive labor requirements, he has sought to conquer by dividing.Rather than expand his company, he set up a second, and then a third, all capping the work force at fewer than 49 employees. Like-minded business owners are the reason France holds the curious distinction of having more than twice as many companies with exactly 49 employees, as it does those with 50 or more.Economists say France\u2019s 50-plus labor rules, which require employers to implement stringent and costly job protections \u2014 including a workers\u2019 council with labor union delegates, a health and safety committee, and annual collective bargaining \u2014 are one reason the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy runs an unemployment rate more than twice Germany\u2019s.Worker councils do exist in various forms in some other European Union countries, including Spain, where employers also say the additional costs from having more than 50 employees discourages business expansion. In the United States, businesses do not face as many workplace regulations, but their costs do tend to rise after the 50th employee, mainly because of additional health care obligations.But in France, because of the potential for union activism and a multitude of other additional regulations, crossing the 50-employee threshold is seen as particularly onerous.\u201cThe idea was not to pass 50,\u201d Mr. Plantier, a wiry, energetic man, said as muscled workers wielding climbing gear bustled about. \u201cIn France, regulations and costs become almost overwhelming once your company reaches a certain size. It\u2019s a disincentive to hire, and it holds the country back.\u201d\u201cFrance must reform,\u201d said Jacques Attali, an adviser to French governments and the author of a landmark 2008 report on the French labor market, which warned that the thresholds stunt growth and employment. \u201cIf not, we will all be singing while the ship goes down.\u201dWith the economy stagnant, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has sought to avoid that outcome. Recently, he sought to encourage hiring by trimming the country\u2019s 3,200-page labor code, in part by making it easier for companies to shed workers or cut pay and working hours during downturns.This month, he went further and proposed lifting or temporarily suspending the 50-plus set of obligations to stoke job creation. But as Mr. Hollande toils under the lowest opinion-poll rankings ever for a French president, he risks a clash with some members of his Socialist party and powerful labor organizations.When he recently held a conference in Paris to address unemployment, the two main unions \u2014 the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail and Force Ouvri\u00e8re \u2014 boycotted it. They assailed the threshold reform plan as an effort to weaken collective worker representation, saying there was no proof firms would create more jobs under a deal.Employers had already broken pledges to set hiring targets in exchange for 30 billion euros, or $40.5 billion, in payroll tax breaks, Thierry Lepaon, the general secretary of the C.G.T., said at the time. Raising the employee ceiling would dilute trade union rights and employers\u2019 responsibilities, dealing \u201can unprecedented blow to democracy and to social democracy in particular,\u201d he said.Proponents say the 50th-worker threshold is meant to protect employees and give them some say in managing the company. The workers\u2019 council can object, for instance, if bosses are thought to be spending money inefficiently, or flouting workers\u2019 rights.\u201cWorkers\u2019 councils can be good because they allow personnel representatives to help change the economic situation of the enterprise,\u201d said David Askienazy, a partner at AM+DA, a French employment consulting practice. \u201cIf this relationship is well managed, it can help the boss understand employees\u2019 concerns better.\u201dBut employers say the requirements also hurt business. A 2012 study by the London School of Economics showed that the cost of additional rules for 50-plus companies in France was equivalent to about a 5 to 10 percent increase in wages. \u201cThere is a strong disincentive to grow,\u201d the study concluded.Half an hour north of \u00c9guilles, Tanguy Roelandts, the founder of Puyricard, a maker of luxury French chocolates, faced such challenges when his business started booming a decade ago.He enlarged staff, training employees in the artisanal methods of handmade bonbons, calissons and other confections. The firm was like a family, he said, with annual sales of about \u20ac10 million.But after he hired his 50th employee, \u201cit didn\u2019t go well,\u201d Mr. Roelandts said.The change added about \u20ac32,000 to Puyricard\u2019s annual operating costs, and Mr. Roelandts said he wound up spending half his time dealing with administrative issues and state bureaucracy.Recently, for example, the government required him to calculate how much chocolate he could ration for France in case of a war, a task that took days.\u201cThat\u2019s 50 percent of my time spent trying to apply rules that don\u2019t advance the business, and that detract me from finding new products and markets,\u201d he said.But the biggest problem came when Mr. Roelandts created the works council, which French employers have long argued can raise workplace tensions in a country where unions often strike, and have even held bosses captive to prevent layoffs.Although none of his employees were unionized, Mr. Roelandts said, unions contacted Puyricard workers and enrolled them when he set up the council.\u201cSuddenly we found ourselves in a brutal discourse, and the dialogue became very different,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was a misfortune to have passed the 50 mark,\u201d he added, though he said he had come too far to scale back.\u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d Mr. Roelandts continued. \u201cThe situation in France has become so complex, that many company owners decide not to grow. They get to 50 people and say, That\u2019s enough.\u201dBack in \u00c9guilles, Mr. Plantier said there was ample reason to keep payroll below 50 at each of his work sites.\u201cIn France, there is this image of the boss as a thug, and if he\u2019s successful, it\u2019s because he\u2019s exploited workers,\u201d Mr. Plantier said. Eschewing a union-led workers\u2019 council could avoid such tension in a small firm where he had worked closely with employees for years, he reasoned.Of course, he said, it was hardly efficient to run three separate operations, instead of having all of his employees on one payroll.\u201cSplitting it up complicates management, organization and a whole lot of other things,\u201d said Mr. Plantier, who set up two annexes elsewhere in Provence, so far with 15 employees in each, by registering them under slightly different company names.Occasionally, he said, his organization has lost business because it cannot assign enough workers at various sites to meet demand.\u201cEmployees will say, we have a lot of orders, we need to hire more. And I tell them we can\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Plantier said. \u201cThey accept it, but they say it\u2019s a shame.\u201dToday, Mr. Plantier said, many French companies have taken the same route he has.\u201cUnless things change,\u201d he said, \u201cFrance will be left behind while the world passes us by.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Replay 2010 Strategy at State Level", "Date": "2014-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE \u2014 Republican candidates for governor around the country have built an unexpectedly strong position for election this fall, helped by an improving economy, disaffection with President Obama and a national fund-raising machine that is leagues ahead of the opposition.Four years after an economic crisis and opposition to Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law propelled Republicans to capture a lopsided majority of statehouses across the country, they are faced with a staggering political task: defending 22 of the 36 executive mansions that will be up for grabs in November, led by a governor who is trying to rebound from a scandal.While the sheer scale of Republican gains four years ago offers Democrats a wealth of opportunities to win, the political environment appears to be tilting again in the Republicans\u2019 direction.The recession that doomed Democrats in 2010 has shifted into a recovery, driving down jobless rates and bolstering Republican incumbents. At the same time, President Obama\u2019s approval ratings have fallen even in states that he won in 2012.\u201cIt gives me enormous flexibility,\u201d Mr. Christie said of the association\u2019s financial advantage, noting that he would raise money in 14 states over the next two months. \u201cWe\u2019ve narrowed our own map and are able to go on offense in some other states.\u201dThe improving economy creates curious and somewhat contradictory political conditions for the two parties. The brightening outlook has given many Republican governors the beginnings of a comeback story to sell to their voters. That forces their Democratic opponents to play down the good job numbers as illusory, even as Democrats in Washington claim success.At the same time, the economic turnaround is not enough to raise Mr. Obama\u2019s overall standing in several pivotal states, weighing down Democratic candidates for governor who might otherwise be in better shape.Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, for example, was widely viewed as imperiled, but the improving economic climate in his state, where unemployment has fallen by five percentage points since Mr. Scott, a Republican, was elected in 2010, has lifted his prospects.Governor Shumlin acknowledged the difficult climate, but expressed optimism about his party\u2019s potential to make gains.\u201cIn governors\u2019 races they ask one simple question: Has the governor delivered on job growth, economic vitality and making investments in infrastructure, education and our kids\u2019 future?\u201d Mr. Shumlin said.The stakes in the country\u2019s statehouses are arguably higher than those in the battle for control of the United States Senate, which has consumed most of the media coverage and money from both parties this year. Washington is likely to remain gridlocked regardless of which party wins control of the Senate in November, but the success of Republican governors this fall, along with retention of Republican majorities in dozens of state legislatures, would cement the sweeping changes on economic and social issues that have been implemented in state capitals across the country. In 17 states with Republican governors up for re-election, the party also controls the legislature.The state races will also have a major impact on state and national policies: the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the fate of big tax cuts, and further winnowing of union rights and voting access.Republicans are defending governorships in 22 of the 36 states with elections this fall, including 12 that they gained in the Republican wave of 2010.The landscape for governors is in some ways the opposite of the Senate map this year. While Democrats are forced to protect Senate seats in conservative-leaning states such as Arkansas and Louisiana, Republicans are doing much of the same with their governors in states that have favored Democrats in recent elections.No Republican incumbent is as vulnerable as Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, who was elected with Tea Party support but has seen his standing fall after making deep cuts to education, and now is believed to be trailing his Democratic challenger, Tom Wolf, by a significant margin.Yet the hardest-fought races are likely to take place in the Midwest, where the governors associations, business and labor are already spending millions. After failing to contest the New Jersey governor\u2019s race last year, and letting a potential presidential hopeful, Mr. Christie, win by a landslide, Democrats are determined to defeat Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and snuff out his White House aspirations. Like Mr. Walker, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan has taken on unions, and made himself a prime target for Democrats.Neither of the two Midwestern Republicans, however, faces as tough a re-election battle as Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois, a Democrat whose effort to reform the state\u2019s pension system has sent his popularity plummeting.The Republican association\u2019s enormous cash advantage has allowed it to spend heavily in recent months in an early wave of advertising intended to bolster the party\u2019s governors and candidates: about $25 million in 12 states, almost all of which have Republican incumbents.Democratic governors are plainly irritated that some of the country\u2019s biggest liberal contributors are more focused on Washington elections when state races have become so pivotal in shaping policy. The largest individual donor to the Democratic Governors Association through March was Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmental activist, who gave $250,000 to the group late last year. (Some liberal donors have contributed more heavily to groups based in their own states.)Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, who led the governors association before Mr. Shumlin, said some Democratic donors did not see the same opportunity for an investment in term-limited governors as with members of Congress.\u201cIt was my experience in making some of these phone calls that a lot of our individual contributors enjoyed the fact that they could have an 18-year relationship with a senator they contributed to, but they could only have at most an eight-year relationship with a governor they contributed to,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley said.Matt Walter, the committee\u2019s president, said it had raised more than $24 million through June, close to twice as much as it had raised by the same point in the 2010 election cycle, when his party took control of 21 state legislative bodies.In presentations to donors, the group has laid out ambitious plans to expand or preserve Republican legislative membership this fall.\u201cIt\u2019s the legislature and other down-ticket races \u2014 and courts \u2014 that really give governors power,\u201d Mr. Walter said.The group is focusing its efforts on chambers where Republicans hold very narrow majorities, including several in states that lean Democratic at the presidential level, such as Iowa and Pennsylvania. Officials there have argued that the aggressively conservative policy making of Republican lawmakers in more center-leaning states has turned off voters.\u201cThe fact is, Republicans have badly overreached in the states where they\u2019re in control,\u201d said State Senator Michael E. Gronstal of Iowa, the Democratic majority leader.Jonathan Martin reported from Nashville, and Nicholas Confessore from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Overvalued? Not So Fast", "Date": "2014-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 With stock markets continuing to hit new highs almost daily despite geopolitical disasters and human tragedies unfolding in Ukraine, Gaza, Syria and Iraq, there has been much head-scratching about the baffling complacency of investors.One plausible explanation is that geopolitics tends not to have much bearing on investment returns. Another possibility is that stock prices, even after their three-fold rise since March 2009, are still low enough to allow for the financial risks associated with geopolitical turmoil. That was essentially what Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the United States Federal Reserve, suggested last week when she said that stock prices \u201cremain generally in line with historic norms.\u201dMany economists and analysts, however, take exactly the opposite view, arguing that stock prices have been so absurdly overvalued for so long that investors have been overcome by greed and have become completely irrational.The most famous proponent of this view is Robert J. Shiller, the Nobel laureate Yale University economist, who is often credited with predicting both the 2000 stock market crash and the bursting of the American housing bubble.He did this in the two editions of his book \u201cIrrational Exuberance\u201d \u2014 the first published in March 2000, just days before the crash in Internet and technology stocks, the second in 2005, a year before the bursting of the housing bubble in the United States.Mr. Shiller\u2019s argument that stock prices have been inflated to irrational levels is centered on a statistic called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or the Shiller P/E. Conventional price-to-earnings ratios, or P/Es, divide the current level of share prices by the earnings estimated by analysts for the year ahead. At present, this ratio for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 is about 17 \u2014 and on this basis many conventional analysts, including Federal Reserve economists, conclude that stock prices in the United States are reasonably valued. A P/E ratio of 17 implies that if companies can sustain this level of profitability, they will provide investors with annual earnings of one-seventeenth, or 5.9 percent, which compares favorably with long-term interest rates on government bonds of about 1 percent after adjusting for inflation.Shiller P/E, by contrast, divides the present level of stock prices by their average profits over the past 10 years (after indexing for inflation). And to judge whether stock valuations are reasonable, Mr. Shiller compares them not with the prevailing level of interest rates, but with the long-term average of the Shiller P/E. Viewed against this yardstick, share prices on Wall Street look grossly over-valued. The Shiller P/E on the S.&P. 500 is at present 26.3, which is far above the long-run average of 16.1 calculated by Mr. Shiller\u2019s research on the profits of leading American businesses since the late 19th century. The implication is that Wall Street is grossly overvalued and that investors should prepare for a loss of at least the 40 percent required to return the ratio to 16. In fact, the expected declines from today\u2019s vertiginous price level should logically be much bigger than 40 percent, because the very definition of an average requires that a long period of far-above-average prices must be followed by an equally long period of deeply undervalued stocks.Why then are investors not panicking? There are many theoretical objections to the Shiller approach. His arbitrary 10-year averaging takes no account of the length and depth of business cycles and makes no allowance for accounting write-offs. The Shiller P/E will continue to be upwardly biased until 2019 by the longest recession in American history and the biggest-ever corporate write-offs that were suffered by banks in the United States.Even more damning is Mr. Shiller\u2019s failure to adjust earnings for accounting changes and the effect of inflation on inventory valuations, distortions that greatly exaggerated profits in the 1970s and produced understated P/Es. The most fundamental objection embraces all these technical arguments: any comparison of valuations covering very long periods is meaningless if it fails to take into account vast changes in technology, economic policies, interest rates, social and political structures, taxes and so on. And why, after all, should the returns expected today on Wall Street bear any relationship to what investors earned in the agricultural booms and busts of the 1880s or the Great Depression of the 1930s or the inflation of the 1970s?But leaving aside the theoretical arguments, what about the practical usefulness of Shiller P/E as an investment tool? The recent evidence is conclusive: for the past 25 years, the Shiller P/Es signals have been almost uniformly wrong. Since 1989, the S.&P. 500 has multiplied eightfold, while total returns, including dividends, have increased the value of an average equity investment twelvefold. But investors who followed Mr. Shiller\u2019s methodology would have missed out on almost all these gains, since the Shiller P/E showed the stock market to be overvalued 97 percent of the time during this 25 years. And even during the two brief periods when the Shiller P/E was below its long-term average, in early 1990 and from November 2008 to April 2009, it never sent a clear buy signal. Instead, Mr. Shiller\u2019s approach suggested that the valuations in 1990 and 2009 were only just below fair value, implying there was very limited upside at the beginning of bull markets in which prices multiplied fivefold from 1990 to 2000 and threefold from 2009 to 2014 (so far).The Shiller P/Es predictive performance would have been just as bad in earlier decades. During the equity bull market of the 1950s and 1960s, for example, the Shiller P/E would have shown Wall Street to be overvalued for 96 percent of the 19-year period from early 1955 to late 1973.Only in January 1974 did the Shiller P/E move below what was then its long-run average, implying that it might finally be a \u201csafe\u201d time to buy stocks. Straight after the Shiller P/E sent this first \u201cbuy signal\u201d in almost two decades, Wall Street crashed by 40 percent in 12 months.Time will tell whether the new records on Wall Street are evidence of irrational exuberance or simply a reasonable response to gradual economic recovery, as suggested by Ms. Yellen (correctly, in my view). But one piece of evidence we can safely ignore in making this judgement is the Shiller P/E.Advertisement"}

On a recent night, over 100 people were staying in yurts.\u201d\u0095 \u201cFifty-six percent of guests staying on Airbnb on a recent weekend were doing so for their first time. Last week, guests left reviews for hosts in 42 different languages. Over 17 million total guests have stayed on Airbnb. It took Airbnb nearly four years to get its first million guests. Now one million guests stay on Airbnb every month.\u201d\u0095 \u201cRoughly 120,000 people stayed in Brazil in Airbnb-rented rooms for the World Cup, including travelers from over 150 different countries. Airbnb hosts in Brazil earned roughly $38 million from reservations during the World Cup. The average host in Rio earned roughly $4,000 during the monthlong tournament \u2014 about four times the average monthly salary in Rio. And 189 German guests stayed with Brazilians on the night of the Brazil/Germany World Cup semifinal match.\u201d\u0095 July 5, 2014, was Airbnb\u2019s biggest night ever. \u201cIts platform hosted over 330,000 total guests staying around the world \u2014 in thousands of cities and over 160 different countries,\u201d said Chesky. In Paris, nearly 20,000 people were staying in Airbnb rooms on July 5. In 2012, that number was under 4,000.What\u2019s the secret? Who knew so many people would rent out rooms in their homes to strangers and that so many strangers would want to stay in other people\u2019s spare bedrooms?The short answer is that Airbnb understood that the world was becoming hyperconnected \u2014 meaning the technology was there to connect any renter to any tourist or businessperson anywhere on the planet. And if someone created the trust platform to bring them together, huge value could be created for both parties. That was Airbnb\u2019s real innovation \u2014 a platform of \u201ctrust\u201d \u2014 where everyone could not only see everyone else\u2019s identity but also rate them as good, bad or indifferent hosts or guests. This meant everyone using the system would pretty quickly develop a relevant \u201creputation\u201d visible to everyone else in the system. Take trusted identities and relevant reputations and put them together with the Internet and suddenly you have 120,000 people staying in Brazilians\u2019 homes instead of hotels at the World Cup. Obviously, there are exceptions and bad apples, and Airbnb provides $1 million in damage coverage for such cases, but the numbers say the system is working for a lot of people. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to move back to a place where the world is a village again \u2014 a place where a lot of people know each other and trust each other ... and where everyone has a reputation that everyone else knows,\u201d said Chesky, 32. \u201cOn Airbnb, everyone has an identity.\u201d You can\u2019t rent a room from someone or to someone unless you create a profile. And the more information you put into your profile \u2014 license, passport, Facebook page and reviews of people who have stayed with you \u2014 the more customers are likely to come. And the better reputation you earn from reviews, \u201cthe more other people want to work with you,\u201d Chesky added. \u201cAll the social friction because of a lack of trust gets removed.\u201d In the process, \u201cyou unlock all this value and the world starts to feel like a community again.\u201dBut what happens to \u201cownership?\u201dBut what will this mean for traditional jobs? Today, said Chesky, \u201cyou may have many jobs and many different kinds of income, and you will accumulate different reputations, based on peer reviews, across multiple platforms of people. ... You may start by delivering food, but as an aspiring chef you may start cooking your own food and delivering that and eventually you do home-cooked meals and offer a dining experience in your own home.\u201d Just as Airbnb was \u201cable to find use for that space you never found use for, it will be the same for people. That skill, that hobby that you knew was there but never used it,\u201d the sharing economy will be able to monetize it. How fast that happens will depend, in part, on regulators and tax collectors in different cities \u2014 not all of whom like people turning their spare bedrooms into hotels or their kitchens into pop-up restaurants. The sharing economy can complement the existing one, and make the pie bigger. But the bigger the Ubers and Airbnbs get, the more incumbents will resist them. This will be a struggle between the 20th-century economy and the 21st\u2019s.The 20th-century economy was powered by big corporations that standardized everything because they never really knew their customers, argued Chesky. \u201cThe 21st-century economy will be powered by people\u201d \u2014 where the buyers all have identities and the producers all have personal reputations \u2014 \u201cso I will be able to sell something directly to you and delight you and surprise you, and the selection you\u2019ll be able to choose from won\u2019t be 4 but 4,000,000.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how it will play out, but given Airbnb\u2019s rapid growth, Chesky\u2019s argument definitely has my attention.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the G.O.P. Be a Party of Ideas?", "Date": "2014-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, fresh from his easy primary win in Kentucky, who said in his keynote remarks that the time had come for the G.O.P. to stop being the handmaiden to Wall Street and instead attend to the anxieties of the middle class. \u201cOur average voter is not John Galt,\u201d McConnell said, referring to the visionary hero of Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d that sacred text of the libertarian right. \u201cHymns to entrepreneurialism are, as a practical matter, largely irrelevant.\u201d Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a Tea Party hero elected in the wave of 2010, was there promoting a child-tax-credit proposal. South Carolina\u2019s Tim Scott, one of the Senate\u2019s two sitting African-Americans, scolded his party for not having \u201cspent enough time figuring out how to unleash the American dream in some of our strongest and poorest areas of the country.\u201dAnd then there was Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, its second-highest-ranking figure and, most assumed, the next speaker of the House. Cantor\u2019s rise in power and visibility over the last six years was largely a result of his role in devising the Republican strategy of unbending opposition \u2014 always, everywhere \u2014 to anything Barack Obama proposed. Cantor built strong ties to Wall Street and to wealthy, conservative donors, and yet here he was, too, espousing the new reformist principles: that the G.O.P. was letting down its actual base, by which he meant \u201cthe bulk of the people in this country\u201d who \u201care feeling that this country is not there for them.\u201d Sounding like a graduate of the Joe Biden School of Empathy, Cantor told the audience that he himself has found, when imagining a path toward better policy, that \u201cit\u2019s very helpful sometimes to think about the working family or maybe the single mom who at the end of a hard day has put her kids to bed and then has to face how she is going to make ends meet and pay the bills at the end of the month.\u201dStrangest of all, the true stars of the proceedings were the intellectuals whose work was showcased that morning and had seeped into the legislators\u2019 rhetoric. Two young men, in particular, were responsible for this change: Yuval Levin, a former policy adviser to George W. Bush and founder of the earnest quarterly journal National Affairs, and Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor at National Review and columnist at Bloomberg View. Each is an intellectual prodigy in his 30s, and together they have become the leaders of a small band of reform conservatives, sometimes called reformicons, who believe the health of the G.O.P. hinges on jettisoning its age-old doctrine \u2014 orgiastic tax-cutting, the slashing of government programs, the championing of Wall Street \u2014 and using an altogether different vocabulary, backed by specific proposals, that will reconnect the party to middle-class and low-income voters.The reformicons, it seemed, had captured their party\u2019s imagination. But three weeks later, on June 10, the narrative of the newly in-touch G.O.P. met the colder reality of politics, with its pitiless winnowing of winners and losers. Eric Cantor, in what was supposed to be a cakewalk primary, succumbed to David Brat, a far-right challenger so obscure that national anti-establishment organizations like FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth, which poured millions into other insurgencies, kept out of this one.\u201cI hadn\u2019t even been following the race, as it seems almost no one had, since there wasn\u2019t really any serious talk of his being in jeopardy,\u201d Levin wrote to me in an email the morning after Cantor\u2019s loss, cannily distancing himself from the soon-to-be-former majority leader. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him well but had talked with him now and then about particular issues, especially health care, when asked.\u201dStill, a new story line emerged. Cantor became the losing face of reformism, the \u201cposter boy\u201d (as The Wall Street Journal called him) and \u201cone of the patron saints\u201d (Ezra Klein) of an \u201cupscale faction of the party calling themselves \u2018reform conservatives\u2019 \u201d (Politico). The reformist wonks, crunching through numbers and looking for an alternative to the six-year strategy of \u201cjust say no,\u201d were now depicted as the elite establishment of the G.O.P. And as Republican lawmakers and strategists look ahead to November and beyond, there was suddenly a new worry. Instead of saving the party from itself, the reformers risked being consumed by the Republicans\u2019 ongoing identity crisis.After Obama\u2019s sweeping victory in 2008, Levin was one of many conservative intellectuals who, as he put it to me this past March, \u201cwere trying to figure out what the hell this new world looked like.\u201d He had been writing for National Review and The Weekly Standard, but they are political journals, and Levin saw an urgent need on the right for serious policy ideas. Out of this came National Affairs, the quarterly he founded and continues to edit, with a small staff, out of his office at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a think tank \u201cdedicated to applying the Judeo-Christian moral tradition to critical issues of public policy.\u201d As Levin said: \u201cThe magazine tries to sit at the intersection of political ideas and public policy. That\u2019s where a lot of the action has to happen. You have to persuade conservatives and voters in general. And you need to have a coherent vision underlying a policy agenda.\u201dOver time, this formulation has assumed new meaning. When Kristol and colleagues like Daniel Bell and Nathan Glazer began their project, the Great Society was at its peak, and an abundance of new programs \u2014 dealing with poverty, education and housing, among others \u2014 were ripe for analysis. But in the decades that followed, government ambition shrank, largely as a result of the critiques Kristol made. In that period the G.O.P. was often acknowledged to be the party of ideas, while Democrats seemed to have lapsed into defending various so-called interest groups. Since then, the situation has reversed. Democrats have pushed the policy debate, while Republicans have become a party of opposition. Today Republican \u201crule\u201d often means obstruction, and its supposed principles sound like dogma. As for reality, it gave us the presidential prospects of Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann and absurdist moments, like the Republican presidential-primary debate in which all eight participants said they would reject a hypothetical deal with Democrats in which one dollar of increased taxation would be exchanged for 10 dollars of reduced spending.This was the sterile soil in which Levin planted National Affairs, which exudes seriousness of an almost antiquated kind. Each issue is the size of a small book, unleavened by illustration or even reported narrative. The typical Levin-assigned-and-edited article leads the reader through a forced march of acronyms and statistics and of formulations like this: \u201cThe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (P.R.W.O.A.) replaced A.F.D.C. with a new program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Under TANF, families can draw federal aid for only five years, to underline that welfare is supposed to be temporary. And where federal funding for A.F.D.C. had been open-ended, for TANF it is fixed, so that states must pay for any expansion of welfare.\u201dThe descriptions are both flattering and tinged with irony, for this is not a hospitable moment for serious-minded intellectuals on the right. The place once claimed in the culture by Kristol and William F. Buckley Jr. is now inhabited by Fox News hosts and Rush Limbaugh and the radio host Laura Ingraham, who is widely credited with mobilizing the troops who expelled Eric Cantor from Congress. Levin is circumspect about the competing noise. What disturbs him more is the long years of silence on the front where he operates. Rather than blame the media agitators and congressional extremists for his party\u2019s lack of substance, Levin said on a recent panel devoted to \u201cthe future of conservatism\u201d that \u201cthe policy vacuum on the right itself has been the fault for a long time of people like us.\u201d\u201cIn the immediate aftermath of defeat, there\u2019s a temptation to take comfort in pleasing illusions,\u201d Ramesh Ponnuru told me this past March, over filet mignon at the Palm, the Dupont Circle steakhouse. He was recalling the shock that conservatives felt after Obama\u2019s first victory. If Levin is the reformers\u2019 big thinker, then Ponnuru, who entered Princeton just after his 17th birthday and graduated summa cum laude (in history), is its cold-eyed political realist. \u201cThe Republican ranks were full of people up and down the line,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom the average voter to sophisticated operatives, that were of the view that if we\u2019d just been a little more pure in the Bush years, none of this would have happened, and the path to power is just to purify ourselves.\u201dThis was understandable. The \u201cbig government\u201d conservatism of the Bush administration alienated many on the right. There was a libertarian reaction, and it set the Tea Party aboil and helped the G.O.P. triumph in 2010. But that victory reflected the passions of only a portion of the electorate, much of it restricted to the South and the Plains states, and it also sent up a wave of fringe candidates who cost Republicans control of the Senate.Nevertheless, the appetite for ideological purity seemed insatiable and overrode all other considerations. Even cooler heads were persuaded that Mitt Romney would coast to victory as long as he could convince the activist wing of the party that he was a true conservative. \u201cThe result of the 2012 election was more disorienting than the \u201908 election,\u201d Ponnuru said. He described his futile attempt to educate House members at their annual retreat in January 2013, when Ponnuru worked through data showing that the loss couldn\u2019t be pinned on Romney alone. \u201cAs much as people say Romney was a weak candidate, he ran ahead of Senate candidates in almost every state\u201d \u2014 a crucial point that Ponnuru mentioned to the Republican caucus. \u201cI would have expected these guys, being political professionals, to know that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know it. They knew that Romney lost, and they knew that they won, and that was about all they knew.\u201dIn fact, some in Washington did know better. One was John Murray, Eric Cantor\u2019s deputy chief of staff. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of inertia on Capitol Hill,\u201d Murray told me last month. Debt reform and tax reform \u201cwere taking up a lot of oxygen\u201d \u2014 and crowding out many other issues that most voters were worried about: rising health care costs, exorbitant college-tuition expenses, jobs that didn\u2019t pay enough. \u201cI was frustrated, because I wanted us to be more offensively postured around issues like how to help the middle class.\u201dIn October 2011, Murray formed an advocacy group called YG Network \u2014 YG as in Young Guns, the tag adopted by Cantor and two other stars in the Republican House, Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy. Since it was formed as a nonprofit, YG Network operated independently of the politicians from whom it took its name. Murray envisioned it as a kind of processing plant for policies that could be pitched toward middle-class voters. A self-described \u201cmoney guy,\u201d he raised more than $12 million for the cause in 2012. The next year, he commissioned polls and focus groups with middle-class voters in four midsize cities. Researchers sorted respondents into two groups of around a dozen people. One group consisted of self-identified Tea Party supporters, the other of moderate swing voters. What was interesting to Murray was that, aside from a few hot-button ideological issues, the two groups sounded alike. Their paramount concerns were nagging \u201ckitchen-table-centric\u201d issues. In Murray\u2019s paraphrase: \u201cFuel prices are up. Grocery bills are up. The kids are home now, but who\u2019s going to help us get them to college?\u201d The respondents were not Obama fans, but they also felt as if the Republicans weren\u2019t helping them, either.Murray was aware of the various reform proposals being published in National Affairs and elsewhere, but, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a difference between how an academic and policy wonk approaches the discussion and how a political-communication person does it.\u201d To help sell these ideas more widely, he turned to April Ponnuru, Ramesh\u2019s wife, who was working as a senior policy adviser to Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican. In December 2013, Ponnuru left her job on the Hill to become YG Network\u2019s policy director. \u201cIt\u2019s the only game in town,\u201d she told me. \u201cMost of the other activities have been negative and destructive.\u201d She, too, talked at length about how the party was out of touch. \u201cThe biggest problem is that the politicians don\u2019t represent the people. We\u2019re identified with the rich and big business,\u201d she said, ticking off a list of constituencies that Republicans have alienated: \u201cSingle women, Hispanics, young people.\u201d Also as a wife and mother, she had serious doubts about any movement \u201cthat can offer nothing to a married woman with three children at the bottom half\u201d of the economic heap.Ponnuru\u2019s first step was to organize a brainstorming session with her husband, Levin and Peter Wehner (who, like Levin, was an adviser for George W. Bush and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center). In widely read articles that offended many on the right, Wehner had been urging Republicans to repudiate the extreme wing of their party. The fifth person present was Kate O\u2019Beirne, a former National Review editor who was now a policy adviser to YG Network.The challenge was turning policy into politics \u2014 how to get these ideas out to more lawmakers than the handful who had been closely following the reformists\u2019 work. The group batted around possibilities \u2014 a big public-policy conference, a statement of principles \u2014 before settling on, perhaps unsurprisingly, \u201ca collection of essays that we would refine and discuss at a conference,\u201d April Ponnuru recalled. The participants in the conference would be drawn from the interlocking worlds of think tanks and politics, and the expectation was that the time spent working through and refining policy ideas would bring the groups closer together and result in a more rigorous, politically realistic vetting.\u201cI think there\u2019s more of an appetite by people to listen [to these ideas],\u201d Strain told me. \u201cAnd that includes elected leaders.\u201d At the moment, he was also on a Twitter binge, urging House Republicans to stop stalling on passing an extension of unemployment-insurance benefits, a lifeline to the long-term unemployed. Some on the right, like Rand Paul, said extended assistance not only coddled the jobless but also stigmatized them, scaring off potential employers. Strain disagreed. \u201cSimple statistics tell the story,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a conservative-liberal thing. If you look at research, the best guess is: If you let benefits expire, people will take jobs they otherwise wouldn\u2019t take, but more will drop out of the labor force entirely. Conservatives, because of their conservatism, shouldn\u2019t want that. We\u2019re the party of work, earned success, championing people to lead their own lives.\u201dBut for reformers, it was a breakthrough. The plan wouldn\u2019t save a dime in the short run \u2014 in fact, it would most likely increase costs \u2014 but it met the bigger ideological goal of \u201cincentivizing\u201d work, a pet theme on the right since the days of Kristol and his liberal ally Daniel Patrick Moynihan.Not even the most hardened Republican opposes a better-skilled work force. What sets Rubio\u2019s thinking apart is his enthusiasm for a different approach to educating and training the young. He pointed to programs established by businesses in Miami that groom high-school students in professions like construction and high-skilled auto mechanics. This \u201capprenticeship\u201d idea has been gaining adherents on the left as well as the right, because it is closely tied to the mounting crisis over student debt. The discussion usually centers on graduates who enter the work force in jobs that don\u2019t pay enough to make a serious dent in the tens of thousands they owe in loans. Little is said, however, about the many young people who don\u2019t have the skills or interests to benefit from college but enroll anyway and often drop out, while still being saddled with debt. This is, of course, exactly where policy meets the cold reality of politics.According to Levin, today\u2019s liberals, the heirs of Paine, believe in wholesale technical solutions to the pressing problems of their time; this is \u201cpart and parcel of a larger project to overcome the limitations placed on mankind by his natural condition.\u201d Conservatives, on the other hand, follow Burke in his preference for continuity that extends over generations. One way to preserve that continuity is to push back against the ideas of the present generation by \u201cimposing crucial constraints upon its ambition and its reach.\u201dThis is, at best, a caricature of liberal conceptions of social science. But 13 years later, Levin clings to this view. In conversation, he describes liberal government as a \u201ctechnocratic\u201d monolith, with a master class of experts who construct and administer large-scale programs that subordinate the needs and wishes of the public to the appetites of the policy-makers themselves, who are less interested in making people\u2019s lives better than in seeing their pet theorems worked out. It is an old idea, most commonly associated with the attack on the self-infatuated, power-besotted \u201cnew class\u201d that Irving Kristol and other neoconservatives made a generation ago. Levin has updated the argument for the Obama years, the \u201ctyranny of reason\u201d having resulted, for instance, in a complex health care system designed and administered by a cadre of experts, when it would be better left to the homely market. And yet the unfettered market has historically failed to protect citizens from the ravages of economic downturns, including the recent Great Recession. If any species of blind faith has in fact damaged our democracy, it was blind faith in \u201cthe market,\u201d which gave us the deregulatory fever that began under Reagan and lasted through Obama\u2019s election in 2008.For all his temperateness of tone, and for all the meticulously reasoned arguments that he has shepherded into the pages of National Affairs, Levin justly says his ideas are radical. He envisions not just a shrinking or scaling-back of government, but an entire reimagining of it. He accuses both parties of being filled with pork-hungry \u201cappropriators\u201d who still think of Washington, even in these gridlocked years, as the lavish dispenser of services. Debates today \u2014 about \u201crunaway spending,\u201d about big versus limited government \u2014 reduce, in most instances, to haggling over how much to dispense and who gets what. A true Burkean conservatism, Levin argues, would recast the federal government as the facilitator and supporter of local institutions who are a function of, and a contributor to, a \u201ccivil society.\u201d \u201cThe agenda is not a moderate agenda,\u201d Levin told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a very conservative agenda, more so than a lot of what\u2019s going on in our politics that\u2019s argued at a different pitch and so might seem like it\u2019s more radical.\u201dIn 1980, further inspired by Ronald Reagan\u2019s decision to seek the nomination, the teams started piecing together their proposals into a giant rethinking of government. \u201cIt took about 10 months to have it ready,\u201d Edwards recalled. Completed just before Election Day, the 3,000-page manifesto was titled \u201cMandate for Leadership: Policy Management in a Conservative Administration.\u201d Shortly after Reagan\u2019s landslide victory, Heritage officials carried copies of the mandate to the Hay-Adams Hotel, where they had arranged a secret meeting with Edwin Meese III, the head of Reagan\u2019s transition team. Soon after, the mandate was published as a book, with some 2,000 specific policy recommendations. It became a Beltway best seller as well as a scorecard for the Reagan years. \u201cLater, we calculated something like two-thirds were adopted in whole or in part,\u201d Edwards said. Some \u2014 like Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut and his decision to greatly enlarge the Navy fleet, as well as his decision to fire striking air traffic controllers \u2014 entered presidential annals.\u201cConservatives acting like radicals\u201d is how Edwards described the creators of the mandate. \u201cWe were going for basic changes.\u201dMany in Washington policy circles are familiar with the legend of the \u201cMandate for Leadership.\u201d Yuval Levin, typically, has actually studied it. \u201cIt\u2019s very impressive,\u201d he told me last month. \u201cBut at this point, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve got a specific project of that scale in mind \u2014 maybe we\u2019ll just dump five years of National Affairs on the table.\u201dWhat\u2019s most impressive about the mandate is not the size of the report but the size of the army that produced it, the legion of policy intellectuals primed for such a mission. And that, in turn, implies a huge difference between that earlier era and this one. When Heritage was founded in 1973, 40 years had passed since the New Deal was introduced, and it was reasonable to say, as the movement conservatives of the \u201970s did, that those four decades had been a time in which liberalism reigned uninterrupted. Even the two Republican presidents of the period \u2014 Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon \u2014 accepted the reality of the welfare state and in some ways even extended it.The situation in 2014 looks very different. It is hard to make the case that a new age of liberalism even exists to be rolled back. The shadow of Reagan still looms large. Bill Clinton, the Democrat who broke the Republicans\u2019 streak of victories in 1992, did so as a centrist New Democrat who repudiated the liberal doctrine of his day on issues like race and welfare and diligently courted the blue-collar, white ethnic vote. His famous \u201ctriangulation\u201d consisted of compromises with Republicans, and he made so many that conservatives complained he was stealing their ideas.Today many on the right, including the reformicons, insistently depict Obama as a radical, but they are well aware he kept all but the top sliver of George W. Bush\u2019s giant tax cut. And for all the efforts to discredit Obamacare, it was ratified by the most conservative Supreme Court in modern history. Every reformer I talked to acknowledged that the principle of universal coverage is here to stay, in whatever form, including the operations advanced by Republicans who want to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obama\u2019s plan, the basis of which was hatched from a conservative policy suggestion that originated in 1989 from the Heritage Foundation.The condition that infects our politics today, volatile and unpredictable though it often seems, is a kind of equilibrium or ideological stasis. We have had a succession of three two-term presidents for the first time in nearly 200 years, each elected twice by small \u2014 in some cases tiny \u2014 margins. The one sweeping victory, Obama\u2019s in 2008, was not especially large; he received fewer electoral votes than Clinton got in 1992, when Clinton won with only 43 percent of the popular vote. And not one of the three has managed to hold on to a congressional majority and thereby maintain one-party rule. \u201cIt\u2019s the era of bad feelings,\u201d Ramesh Ponnuru said.That doesn\u2019t mean change won\u2019t come. No one was sure it would in 1979 either. \u201cReagan was able to do what he did because of the crisis that had been created by the Jimmy Carter presidency,\u201d Lee Edwards observed. \u201cIf he had been elected in 1976, we would not have had the kinds of reforms. The goals could not be achieved.\u201dIt is this possibility, not of crisis, but of a sudden drastic change in the political weather, that keeps Levin and his fellow wonks going, though in their case they are waging a battle within the conservative movement they want to speak for. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work, \u201d Levin said. \u201cBut that work has to be done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Decapitated", "Date": "2014-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Tour de France bicycle race kicked off in England this year, in Yorkshire to be precise, and ended its third stage on the Mall outside Buckingham Palace. Next pigs will fly.In fact they\u2019ve already flown, given that this quintessentially French event has started in Britain once before, but still it must be asked if anything is sacred anymore. Perhaps the horse racing at Ascot will soon move to Toulouse.I was in Paris last week. It was beautiful. Tourists lolled on the bridges enjoying picnics of cheese, baguettes and bad red wine. They were happy. The weather was perfect. The French were grumpy, of course. I did not notice any grumbling about the weird displacement of the Tour across the Channel, but encountered complaints over just about everything else.That the French are unhappy has become a commonplace. A nation that loves ideas is living in an ideological void. If that void is filled by anyone it is the rightist leader Marine Le Pen with her cleverly dosed venom about Europe, immigrants, crime, globalization and the other supposed culprits behind French national decline.Unemployment in France is at about double the German level. Growth is at zero. Investment is at new lows. If the European economy is stirring, the French has shown an exceptional capacity to resist signs of life.Manuel Valls, the centrist prime minister hated by many in his own Socialist Party, is trying to cut public-sector spending, loosen labor-market laws, slash payroll taxes, and generally spur job creation and growth by liberalizing a state-heavy economy. Many have tried before him. Many have failed. Such reform in France is a Sisyphean task.France is a modern country as well as a beautiful one. Its attributes, from its health system to its rail system (when not on strike), are well known. But the French dislike modernity. They mistrust modernity. That is the nub of the problem. They dislike and mistrust it for two reasons. Modernity has redefined space and relegated the state. This is intolerable.This is troubling in France because nowhere else is the particularity of place and the singularity of a person\u2019s attachment to it more important. That bond is expressed in the word \u201cterroir,\u201d at once the land, its special characteristics, the nature of its soil, its climate, and the unique human relationship to it. A great Burgundy and an indifferent one may come from properties a hundred yards apart. The soil is not the same, nor the slope of the land. Distance matters. Yet modernity has contempt for it. It even places the Tour de France in England. As Serres put it, \u201cWe live in a new space.\u201dHumanity has also changed its relationship to the state. The French place deep faith in the state. It is the righter of wrongs, the mediator of human affairs, the source of social justice, the object of duty, and the repository of power. The very word deregulation is odious to the French.But technology has shifted power from the state to stateless individuals living in a borderless cyberworld. An e-mail address is now more important and more relevant to the conduct of existence than a physical address. A revolution in communication is underway, not seen since the invention of the printing press, but it is not a French revolution. It is in fact an anti-French revolution. It challenges fundamental French values, the French sense of self, and the French attachment to the state.Valls, the prime minister, appears to be confronting French labor unions in his efforts at reform. What he is really facing is a fundamental objection to modernity.Serres, in his lecture, tells the story of Saint Denis, the Christian martyr decapitated around 250 A.D. Denis is said to have picked up his head and walked several kilometers preaching a sermon. Serres objected as a child, when his mother told him the story, that Denis could not possibly have found his head without his eyes. She rebuked him for failing to understand miracles.Today, Serres says, everyone\u2019s head is on the table in the form of their computers. \u201cYou have been decapitated!\u201d he tells his French audience.That is often how the French feel. I fear there is not much to be done about it, short of miracles.Thomas L. Friedman is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A 401(k) for All", "Date": "2014-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHow so? First, the federal government\u2019s use of tax deductibility to encourage savings turns our progressive structure for taxing income into a regressive one: While earners in the highest income bracket get a 39.6 percent deduction for savings, the hardest-pressed workers, those in the lowest tax bracket, get only a 10 percent deduction for every dollar they manage to put away. Second, while less than 1 percent of lower- and moderate-income Americans can put aside enough to fully \u201cmax out\u201d their benefits on I.R.A. contributions, higher-income Americans can maximize their return on savings by sampling from a menu of tax-preferred savings options. A business owner could theoretically benefit from a 401(k), a SEP I.R.A. of up to $52,000 and a state-based 529 program that allows tax-free savings for college education.Finally, a far larger share of upper-income Americans get matching incentives for savings from their employers. Members of Congress and the White House staff, for example, get an 80 percent match for saving 5 percent of their income. But while half of Americans earning more than $100,000 get an employer match, only 4 percent of those earning under $30,000 and less than 2 percent of those making under $20,000 get any employer match for saving.The results are stunning. Last year, of the $137 billion in tax benefits that went to encourage retirement savings, three times more went to the top 10 percent of taxpayers than to the bottom 60 percent. The top 5 percent of taxpayers get more tax relief for savings than the bottom 80 percent. If the main justification for savings incentives is to help workers overcome shortsightedness about the benefits of long-term accumulated savings, how is it defensible to focus so many of our resources on those best poised to save anyway? One intermediate step would be to replace our regressive system of relying on tax deductibility with a flat tax credit that would give every American a 28 percent tax credit for savings, regardless of income. But why should we stop there? If we know that 401(k)\u2019s with automatic payroll deductions and matching incentives work beautifully for those with access to them, why would we not institute a 401(k) for everyone? A government-funded universal 401(k) would give lower- and moderate-income Americans a dollar-for-dollar matching credit for up to $4,000 saved annually per household. Upper-middle-class Americans could get at least a 60 percent match \u2014 doubling the incentive they get today. The match would be open to workers even if their employers were already matching, which would encourage employers to keep contributing to savings. The match would also be available through I.R.A. contributions for those who were self-employed or who wanted to keep saving even while they were temporarily not working.Employers would have to provide automatic payroll deductions for their employees (while allowing those who still wanted to opt out to do so). Setting the default at \u201copting in\u201d would ensure that workers did not miss out on the match provided by a universal 401(k). The government could set requirements for low fees, transparency and safety to allow for vigorous competition in the private sector while allowing individual savers access to a version of the plan that members of Congress use for their own retirement savings. Costs need not be a roadblock. Among many ways to do it, moderate reforms to the estate tax could allow married couples to leave up to $7 million to their heirs tax-free (instead of the current $10.7 million) while generating over $200 billion in resources over the next decade, which could be used to help tens of millions of savers build their own estates. Even if a universal 401(k) ended up costing the government more than expected, it would still increase national savings overall if the public incentives led to additional private savings.While President Clinton put forward a similar USA Account proposal in 1999 and President Obama has promoted automatic savings proposals since 2009, these ideas have gotten lost in partisan debates on fiscal and Social Security reform. But with the economy recovering and many Americans beginning to focus on rebuilding lost nest eggs, politicians on all sides should see something they like in a policy that would both reduce wealth inequality and encourage individual wealth creation.

{"Headline": "Room for the Family. Bodyguards, Too.", "Date": "2014-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel 10 PhotosThey line up a dozen deep behind the Capitol in Washington, mostly black General Motors S.U.V.s \u2014 Chevrolet Tahoes and Suburbans or their GMC equivalents \u2014 waiting to shuttle important people to important places. Or to lunch at Chipotle.Look! There goes Joe Biden in an armored Suburban. Here are the latest GMCs, the Yukon (called Tahoe, over at the Chevy store) and Yukon XL (a.k.a. Suburban). Except for blunter noses and bits of trim, the GMCs are practically identical to the Chevys. All four models have been redesigned for 2015, but they haven\u2019t changed all that much. They aren\u2019t pretending-to-be-tough crossovers; rather, these are genuine, hulking S.U.V.s with big V8s under their hoods, heavy steel ladder frames under their heavy steel bodies and hitches at their tails, ready to tow up to 8,500 pounds. Both have room for six to nine people in three rows of seats \u2014 or one V.I.P., four aides and a four-person security detail. The same basic vehicle platform is also the basis for the Cadillac Escalade and the stretched Escalade ESV. But missing from this new generation are the pickup-bed versions previously sold as the Chevrolet Avalanche and Cadillac Escalade EXT. If anyone misses those weird truck-S.U.V. combos, their grief is well hidden. At first sight, the differences between the Yukon and the Yukon XL are subtle. From the front doors forward, the sheet metal is identical. The most immediately apparent difference is that on the Yukon, with a 116-inch wheelbase, the bottom of the back doors arch over the rear wheel wells; the rear doors of the Yukon XL, which has a 130-inch wheelbase, are cut straight down to the rocker panel. Beyond that, the XL\u2019s tail overhangs the rear wheels by 6.4 inches more than the regular Yukon\u2019s. And while the new versions have grown a minuscule one-tenth of an inch in total length, all other dimensions match those of the 2014 editions.I drove a well-equipped 4-wheel-drive Yukon SLT \u2014 the mainstream trim level \u2014 on 20-inch wheels. It carried a sticker price of $65,515 and was powered by a 5.3-liter version of G.M.\u2019s latest small-block V8 engine, with direct fuel injection, variable valve timing, 16 pushrods and a cylinder deactivation system to stretch fuel mileage under light loads. The engine is rated at 355 horsepower when running on gasoline and 380 horses on E85 fuel, which contains up to 85 percent ethanol. A conventional 6-speed automatic is the only transmission.I also tested a Yukon XL Denali on 22-inch wheels, also with 4-wheel drive; with a sticker price of $77,470, it represented the glistening top of the line.Denali models \u2014 both the regular and XL versions \u2014 are powered by a 6.2-liter V8 shared with the Escalade. It\u2019s rated at 420 horsepower whether on straight gas or E85. The Denali uses the same transmission as other Yukons but is geared for better acceleration.Passing up the options ladled on my test trucks will knock the prices down significantly. A base rear-drive Yukon SLE is $47,330, and the Yukon XL SLE starts at $50,030. But even the cheapest Yukon Denali is $63,675.The front suspension on both models comes straight from G.M.\u2019s pickups, whereas the rear suspension is a solid axle on coil springs. The coil springs are better for ride quality than the leaf springs of the pickups, but not as sophisticated as the all-independent systems of competitors like the Ford Expedition and Mercedes-Benz GL-Class.So on bumpy surfaces there\u2019s some noticeable jiggle to each Yukon\u2019s back end. It\u2019s not terribly distracting, but it\u2019s noticeable, especially on the shorter version. On smooth surfaces the XL\u2019s ride motions are somewhat more restrained (particularly with the Denali\u2019s magnetic-ride shock absorbers) but these are massive machines weighing from 5,400 to 6,000 pounds. Bumps don\u2019t stand a chance. The XL\u2019s additional length rewards third-row passengers with 10 extra inches of legroom, as well as an added 24 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third seat. It\u2019s also easier to get in and out of the XL\u2019s third-row through the larger rear doors.But all that length makes the XL clumsy to drive in the city. There\u2019s plenty of power, the steering is accurate if a bit numb, the transmission works brilliantly and the brakes do an amazing job dealing with so much mass. Yet despite backup cameras and radar parking aids, parallel parking takes courage.While a 116-inch wheelbase isn\u2019t short, the not-XL Yukon is a tidier and more manageable package. At 17 feet long, it\u2019s almost three inches shorter than the Mercedes S-Class sedan, and despite having less power than its longer Denali brother, feels nimbler. It\u2019s not exactly fun to drive, but it commands the road as smaller vehicles cannot. You feel practically invulnerable.These S.U.V.s have evolved. They look better, inside and out, than before. Some careful carving has given the flanks of the Yukons character and LED lighting at front and rear gives them a strong presence at night. They get slightly better fuel economy, too, with their more advanced engine technology. The Yukon 4-by-4 is rated at 16 m.p.g. in town and 22 on the highway; estimates for the larger XL Denali 4-by-4 are 14/20 m.p.g.Neither comes across as apologetic for its size or shy about its grandeur. But I\u2019d say the subdued three-section grille of the regular Yukon is handsomer and more dignified than the Denali\u2019s chrome colander. No matter the trim, the majestic front seats are tremendously comfortable. And the individual chairs in the second row \u2014 benches are available \u2014 were only slightly less so. The second and third rows fold flat.G.M. may be reeling after recall upon recall, but its recent progress in quality is obvious. The grade of materials in these big, hugely profitable vehicles is high enough to be German. There\u2019s more flash and shiny bits than in a Mercedes or Audi, but everything feels supple and looks well finished. The Denali\u2019s partly digital dashboard is nice enough, but it is simply a re-creation of the ordinary Yukon\u2019s conventional instrumentation. Of course, every imaginable entertainment device is available in either S.U.V., and an onboard Wi-Fi network with 4G LTE Internet connectivity will be available this year.According to the 2010 census, there are more than seven million families with three or more children. Throw some dogs and a boat into that mix, and you can see why there is demand for vehicles like these. Big families still make up the core base of customers, even if they don\u2019t need armored doors or a security detail. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Helsinki Divided on Plan for a Guggenheim Satellite", "Date": "2014-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe have to promote Helsinki, and that\u2019s why we need some international brands like the Guggenheim,\u201d said Jussi Pajunen, Helsinki\u2019s mayor and the project\u2019s chief promoter. But the backlash against the project surprised the Guggenheim Foundation\u2019s top executives. In 2011 critics began questioning the terms of the development deal, which would hand the Guggenheim most of the decision-making power but have the city shoulder all of the costs.\u201cI felt some defensiveness and some very developed hostility to us, a fear which I was empathetic toward \u2014 that the distinct local character of Helsinki would somehow be amalgamated into some sort of gigantic industrial apparatus,\u201d said Richard Armstrong, the director of the foundation and the Guggenheim in New York. That idea was discarded when the Guggenheim returned with a retooled proposal in 2013, responding to some of the criticism. The foundation agreed not to charge the city its licensing fee but rather to help local supporters solicit private donations through a newly formed foundation. The later proposal also increased estimates of annual admission revenues and reduced by half the operation fees for the Guggenheim, to almost $1.4 million a year. Not all the critics are satisfied. \u201cThis is like we are buying a Louis Vuitton bag because it is a famous brand \u2014 we need our own brands,\u201d said Kaarin Taipale, a co-author of \u201cIn the Shadow of Guggenheim,\u201d a book that analyzed the project. \u201cThe financing numbers have raised a lot of questions. They say we have different alternatives, but all are based on spending public money.\u201dMoney is an important issue in Finland, which has been mired in recession for two years and is struggling with a decline in its electronics industry and a weakening of trade with its neighbor Russia. After the Guggenheim revised the proposal, the city board agreed to reconsider its stance but withhold a final decision until after the designs were evaluated.\u201cI was jet-lagged \u2014 I\u2019m human,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said later in a telephone interview. Today, though, he still shies away from discussing alternatives to Finnish funding: \u201cThat\u2019s a wife-beater question, so I am not going to answer,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe all have conditional situations that can develop in the future. I\u2019m not sure how productive it is to be paralyzed by those fears.\u201dAs in some other cities, Helsinki and its mayor are inspired by the success of the Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain, designed by Frank Gehry. Since it opened in 1997, the Basque region has been attracting nearly a million visitors a year, compared with fewer than 100,000 previously. The museum in Helsinki could generate an economic impact of $56 million, creating nearly 500 jobs at the museum and locally, as well as 800 construction jobs, according to estimates by the Boston Consulting Group in a $2.9 million report financed by the city of Helsinki. Much of the Guggenheim Bilbao\u2019s popularity is attributed to its voluptuous, titanium-clad form. Mr. Armstrong said that while the design contest was stirring broad interest, it was not clear whether star architects like Mr. Gehry would take part. He added that the Helsinki design would probably be less flamboyant and have a smaller footprint than the Bilbao museum. Some of the Guggenheim\u2019s critics say the results of the design competition could prove helpful to them in weighing the merits against the costs. \u201cWe want to make sure this project benefits everybody,\u201d said Emma Kari, who leads the Green Party members on the city board. \u201cWe will evaluate the estimates again. There are questions about the amount of people coming,\u201d she said, describing an annual attendance estimate of 550,000 as \u201cquite high.\u201dIf that projection were to prove accurate, a Guggenheim museum would emerge as Finland\u2019s most popular art site while also exceeding the volume of visitors at the Modern Museum in Stockholm.Ultimately, Mr. Armstrong of the Guggenheim is counting on the power of design to transform the rancorous debate into an enthusiastic one. \u201cWhen the drawings come in for real buildings, there will be a gauge of what it will cost,\u201d he said. \u201cI am hopeful that moment will become catalytic.\u201d As for the museum site, he said, \u201cTo me it\u2019s odd that in this supercharming, unusual place we have an asphalt parking lot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiss Banks\u2019 Tradition of Secrecy Clashes With Quests Abroad for Disclosure", "Date": "2014-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZURICH \u2014 For a while, it seemed, the tide had turned against the tradition of secrecy in Zurich, the pristine Alpine city that is a hub of global banking.But the impression of change is misleading, regulators and members of the insular banking fraternity here say. The reality, they say, remains closer to business as usual.Even as the Swiss authorities have nodded at cooperation with frustrated governments abroad, at home laws on the books since 1934 make violating client confidentiality a crime and require bankers to guard secrecy like priests or lawyers. Bankers who cooperate with foreign officials and violate their \u201cduty of absolute silence,\u201d as it is known here, potentially face home raids, prison, fines for secrecy violations and industrial espionage, and the ostracism of colleagues and friends.If anything, a backlash is building to protect the vaunted traditions of secrecy that undergird an essential pillar of the Swiss economy. The right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party says it has gathered 80 percent of the 100,000 signatures required for a voter referendum in coming months to enshrine corporate secrecy in the Constitution, warning against the insidious effect of foreign demands for tax information.Last week, Pierre Condamin-Gerbier, a former banker, faced a Swiss prosecutor on accusations of violating professional secrecy in connection with leaking information to the French authorities. That information forced the resignation last year of a French budget minister who had a secret, undeclared Swiss account at a time when his government was cracking down on tax evasion.The result is that the bankers \u2014 caught in a vise of competing legal forces \u2014 are damned if they help either side. In the meantime, those being pressured to reveal their secrets or those of their clients to American and other foreign authorities investigating tax evasion and other crimes are maintaining their code of silence. For those bankers whose roles have brought legal charges abroad or the threat of them, that means avoiding extradition by staying within Switzerland, living life in legal and personal limbo.The situation is particularly galling to bankers \u2014 most at the midlevel \u2014 who say they are being pressured to take the fall for more powerful superiors in an industry that still jealously guards itself by closing its ranks.Describing a life of secretive techniques worthy of James Bond (who quipped in a 1999 film, \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust a Swiss banker, then what\u2019s the world come to?\u201d), bankers who were interviewed said that one of the practices under most intensive criminal investigation \u2014 the clandestine recruitment of clients in the United States \u2014 was not only known to their bosses, but was also part of a business model.The bankers roamed the West and East Coasts of the United States with company instructions to recruit rich clients on a luxury circuit of five-star hotels, art exhibitions and tennis matches. Their bonuses, they said, depended on the business they cultivated and protected.One veteran banker, who declined to be identified for fear he could be prosecuted in Switzerland for secrecy violations, said every employee who worked with American clients followed strict security instructions.He said the bankers carried special laptop computers formatted so that information could be wiped out instantly with a few keystrokes, and portable printers to avoid leaving traces elsewhere. They avoided staying in the same luxury hotels, switching if anybody recognized them or called them by name. He said he cut the name of the bank off receipts. Customers called from pay phones, using code names.He said he carried separate paper lists, one with code numbers and one with corresponding names. Those names did not surface on bank records because they were shielded in a maze of offshore trusts and foundations, he said. The real value of Swiss bankers to the American authorities, he said, is that the bankers know the identities of the clients, since they had met with them at high-end events like Art Basel in Miami Beach and golf tournaments.\u201cIt was all done for so many years,\u201d the banker said. \u201cEverybody knew. I remember a party a few years ago with other bankers and I said, \u2018You know we all have one foot in prison.\u2019 Everybody laughed. Maybe that\u2019s why we were all paid so much.\u201dWhile such tales might seem to come from the heyday of Swiss banking, the culture continues, bankers, regulators and other experts say. \u201cStrictly nothing has fundamentally changed,\u201d said Jean Ziegler, a Swiss sociologist and author. \u201cThe big issue in these banks is that violating secrecy is considered treachery.\u201dTo date, the United States Justice Department has charged more than 35 Swiss bankers and 25 financial advisers with misconduct for facilitating tax evasion. Six have been convicted or pleaded guilty.Some bankers who are under scrutiny say their own personal banks have refused mortgages or canceled personal accounts because of concerns about their reputations being tarnished. One woke up to a dawn raid when his computer and telephone were seized.\u201cWe are going to look very carefully that employees don\u2019t have to pay for the strategies of their bosses,\u201d said Denise Chervet, a spokeswoman for the association. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable now that some of the top executives claim they didn\u2019t know.\u201dTo many bankers, Mr. Elmer\u2019s case is instructive. Now unemployed, he has been imprisoned in the past for more than 200 days and sometimes held in solitary confinement as part of continuing investigations for secrecy violations \u2014 even though some of those violations involved turning information over to the Swiss tax authorities. Mr. Elmer and his former bank have sparred over private detectives who trailed his family, reaching a financial settlement for his daughter in 2011, according to legal documents.A bank spokesman for Julius Baer, which is also under investigation in the United States for aiding tax evasion, declined to discuss Mr. Elmer\u2019s case.In the last few years, Mr. Elmer watched former colleagues face similar stark choices about whether to break the code of absolute silence. None of them, he said, have cracked. \u201cThey do have the power to destroy your life,\u201d Mr. Elmer said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Signals She Won\u2019t Raise Rates to Fight Bubbles", "Date": "2014-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyJanet Yellen just delivered the most significant speech yet in her still-young Federal Reserve chairmanship. It doesn\u2019t necessarily send any startling signals about what the Fed will do next month or even next year. But it tells us a great deal about how she will deal with new risks on the horizon from financial bubbles.Ms. Yellen stakes out her position in about as clear a language as you\u2019ll see from a central banker: She believes that it would most likely be a bad idea to raise interest rates to fight financial excesses. Her focus, crucially, is not on preventing Wall Street from having ups and downs, but on making sure that those ups and downs don\u2019t bring economic disaster.This focus on resilience differs from much of the public discussion, which often concerns whether some particular asset class is experiencing a \u201cbubble,\u201d and whether policy makers should attempt to pop the bubble. Because a resilient financial system can withstand unexpected developments, identification of bubbles is less critical.The leader of the most powerful of those central banks isn\u2019t buying it, and her speech is a shot across the bow arguing that higher interest rates are not the answer to whatever financial excesses one sees.\u201cMonetary policy faces significant limitations as a tool to promote financial stability,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in an event at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. \u201cIts effects on financial vulnerabilities \u2026 are not well understood and are less direct than a regulatory or supervisory approach; in addition, efforts to promote financial stability through adjustments in interest rates would increase the volatility of inflation and employment.\u201dThe Fed is focused on making sure that even if markets in, say, leveraged buyout loans were to take a dive from current frothy levels (this is the one market Ms. Yellen herself mentioned as showing signs of excess), the impact wouldn\u2019t ripple through banks and other financial institutions and cause a broad downturn for the economy. They are doing this by demanding that banks hold more capital, and that they constantly test their portfolios to ensure they could weather a downturn, among other steps.But the most interesting parts of Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech were not so much her cataloging of specific tools the Fed is using to try to address financial risk, many of which watchers of the central bank\u2019s communications have heard about before. It was in her use of recent experiences in the United States and abroad to explain why she thinks interest rate policy is a poor substitute for good regulation.First, many Fed critics view too-low interest rates during the mid-2000s as a crucial factor behind the housing and credit bubble that popped so disastrously beginning in 2007. Sure, higher interest rates in 2003 to 2006 might have slowed the rate of home price growth, Ms. Yellen concedes. But, she adds, \u201cthe magnitude of this effect would likely have been modest relative to the substantial momentum in these prices over the period \u2026 but the job losses and higher interest payments associated with higher interest rates would have directly weakened households\u2019 ability to repay previous debts, suggesting that a sizable tightening may have mitigated vulnerabilities in household balance sheets only modestly.\u201dMoreover, she argues higher interest rates would have done nothing to address some important points of vulnerability in the pre-crisis financial system, such as excessive leverage in the world\u2019s largest banks.She doesn\u2019t absolutely rule out using interest rate policy as a tool to combat financial excess, while making clear it is a less than optimal option. But with her speech on Wednesday, Ms. Yellen is putting banks and everyone else in the financial world on notice: The Fed is not going to protect you from making mistakes. It is just going to try to ensure that if you do make them, the rest of us won\u2019t pay the consequences.Yes, the Yellen Fed will raise interest rates one day, (projections from the policy makers point to that day being in 2015). But they will probably do so because the United States economy is getting back on its feet, not to lean against the winds of markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany and the Minimum Wage", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is obviously too low. So is the Democrats\u2019 proposed increase to $10.10 an hour by 2016. If the minimum wage had merely kept pace over time with inflation, average wages or productivity growth, it would be between $11 an hour and $18 an hour today.It would also be higher if it kept pace with what other advanced economies are prepared to pay. The expected German minimum is noteworthy not only for its level. For nearly 70 years, most wages in Germany have been set by agreements that are collectively bargained between unions and employers. In recent decades, however, and particularly following reunification with the former East Germany, the share of workers who are effectively covered by union agreements has fallen. By enacting an adequate minimum wage, the German Parliament is responding constructively to that development, because a solid wage floor ensures that economic growth is broadly shared even by those who fall outside the collectively bargained framework.In a global economy that has long relied on low wages to lift profits, a relatively high minimum wage in Germany would also reflect a growing consensus there that a high-wage, high-productivity economy is, in fact, an advantage in stabilizing the nation economically and socially. In Germany, as in the United States, business lobbyists and some economists have warned that a robust minimum wage will lead to job losses and higher prices, but that has not been the historical experience. Rather, higher wages for low-wage workers are generally offset by lower labor turnover, while the boost in consumer spending from higher wages is good for the economy. Boosting consumer demand is especially important in Germany, whose economy is overly reliant on exports. Germany\u2019s move offers the United States important lessons, if only lawmakers in Washington would learn. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Budget Is Key Test for India\u2019s New Government", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI \u2014 As India\u2019s newly elected government prepares its first national budget, the business community is watching whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s development-focused campaign promises translate into tangible economic reform.On Wednesday, the government released its economic survey, which comes each year ahead of the budget. The survey predicted that India\u2019s gross domestic product would increase 5.4 percent to 5.9 percent in the current fiscal year, which runs through next March, and would not reach 7 percent growth for at least another two years. Mr. Jaitley said at a news conference that the report \u201cshows the gravity of the economic situation that needs correction.\u201dThe government\u2019s primary challenge will be managing the delicate balance between encouraging growth and constraining the deficit. The previous government\u2019s interim budget, released earlier this year, set the annual deficit target at 4.1 percent of G.D.P., a figure that was widely criticized as unrealistically low. The survey report released Wednesday indicated that India\u2019s fiscal situation is much bleaker than had been portrayed.\u201cThe expectations from this budget are enormous,\u201d said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at the State Bank of India, which is owned by the government. \u201cThe fiscal deficit number is not important because everyone knows it will be higher than 4.1 percent, but a pragmatic road map needs to be set for a credible amount of fiscal consolidation in the next few years.\u201dIn its first significant policy announcement, the Modi administration released on Tuesday a railway budget that hinted that the government was open to private financing and foreign investment to pay for ambitious modernization plans.\u201cThe fact that the railway minister spoke about project implementation and completion, and focused on ongoing projects, is a positive indication,\u201d said Bidisha Ganguly, chief economist at the Confederation of Indian Industry. \u201cHowever, there were no specifics about the financing of the railways, which are currently in extremely bad shape.\u201dDomestic and foreign investors are hopeful that the federal budget announcement will bring some clarity on taxes. \u201cThe government needs to do away with retrospective taxation\u201d \u2014 taxing transactions after the fact \u2014 \u201cas it has distanced investors from India and created a lot of concern and ambiguity related to tax liability,\u201d said Dhanpal Jhaveri, chief executive of Everstone Capital Advisers, a private equity firm.Investors want a schedule for the implementation of the goods and services tax, which will replace direct taxes levied by the central and state governments and is expected to reduce logistical costs substantially.Investors are also concerned about the nature of anti-tax-avoidance rules being considered by the government.Girish Vanvari, co-head of tax at the consulting firm KPMG India said, \u201cThe government needs to create an ecosystem to make India a safe investment jurisdiction.\u201dIndustrial company leaders are hoping the government will step up capital spending on infrastructure projects to enhance growth. \u201cWe are looking for increased budgetary allocations for infrastructure spending, announcements on new projects and tax concessions for infrastructure spending,\u201d said Ms. Ganguly of the Confederation of Indian Industry.One of the ways the government is expected to raise money to offset infrastructure spending is to privatize, or sell stakes in, government-owned companies.\u201cLooking at the subdued growth numbers, the chance of any major improvement in tax collection is remote. So the only avenue at the moment to bridge the fiscal deficit gap is aggressive privatization,\u201d said Amisha Vora, joint managing director at Prabhudas Lilladher Group, a brokerage in Mumbai. \u201cThere are a lot of public-sector companies that are almost defunct and left with only assets, where the business has not been existing for some time now. How to get rid of those assets and realize cash will also be an important area to unlock capital.\u201dIndia\u2019s enormous subsidy bill, now about 2 percent of G.D.P, is one area that is likely to be tempered by political considerations. While subsidies on fuel, transportation and food add a substantial amount to the country\u2019s annual spending, any effort to tinker with them leads to immediate political backlash. When the new government attempted to raise rail fares, the public reacted negatively, and some of the increases were rolled back.\u201cThe government has continued with the increase in petrol and diesel prices, and has also increased fares on both freight and passenger trains, which suggests that they will be taking a more pragmatic approach,\u201d Ms. Vora said. \u201cHowever, there might be a drought situation in India this monsoon, because of which rural income will be under constraint, so the more aggressive steps of price increases and subsidy cuts might be kept for the next budget.\u201dAnalysts predict that the government will be prepared to take calculated political risks before the coming state elections.\u201cThe B.J.P. is also conscious of not upsetting the apple cart in critical states like Haryana and Maharashtra, where elections are coming up soon and the party is poised to do well,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based research center. \u201cThe government is likely to calibrate reforms to fit its timeline, rather than proceed hastily in a big-bang fashion.\u201dHe added that the government would be particularly cautious in tinkering with prices that would directly affect consumers\u2019 bottom line.Yet economists are hoping that economics wins out over politics in the national budget.\u201cThe government should not involve itself in mindless populism, because ultimately that populism creates a burden for future generations,\u201d said Mr. Ghosh, the State Bank of India adviser.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkish Premier Runs for President, an Office He Plans to Strengthen", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Tuesday that he would run for Turkey\u2019s presidency in elections next month, a move that is likely to position him as the country\u2019s dominant political figure for years to come.Mr. Erdogan has held power for more than a decade, having withstood the challenges to his rule from angry street protests and from a corruption inquiry. He is already considered the most consequential political leader here since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey. Capturing the presidency may allow Mr. Erdogan, 60, eventually to surpass even Ataturk\u2019s legacy.But it could come at the cost of deepening the divisions in Turkey between the masses of religious Turkish Muslims, whom Mr. Erdogan represents, and an increasingly angry but divided opposition, composed of liberals, nationalists and urban Turks who want nothing more than for Mr. Erdogan to exit the political stage.In contrast with the post of prime minister, the presidency of Turkey has until now been largely, though not entirely, a ceremonial post. But if Mr. Erdogan wins \u2014 as analysts widely expect \u2014 it is likely to become vastly more powerful.It will also have a greater popular mandate than before: In August, for the first time, the president will be chosen directly by Turkish voters, rather than by the Parliament.Mr. Erdogan would be likely to maximize the office\u2019s existing powers, especially if he can maintain his hold on his party and orchestrate the appointment of a compliant prime minister. The president appoints judges and university rectors and can veto laws passed by Parliament.Mr. Erdogan has also sought to change the Turkish Constitution to create a government dominated by the presidency. So far, he has not been able to muster the necessary support, but many expect him to try again. And his advisers are already laying the groundwork for a much more powerful presidency under Mr. Erdogan.\u201cIf Erdogan is elected, Turkey will have a strong president without a formal presidential system,\u201d Ibrahim Kalin, a top adviser to Mr. Erdogan, wrote in a newspaper column on Tuesday. \u201cThe current Constitution does not allow for a full-blown presidential system. But the powers of the president make it a hybrid system. This needs to be understood properly.\u201dHis nomination was not a surprise. Officials from Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., signaled for weeks that he was likely to be their nominee. Still, it was a splashy affair conducted in front of thousands of party members and government officials in Ankara, the Turkish capital, and it took on the choreographed trappings of a coronation.It left unanswered the question of the political future of Turkey\u2019s current president, Abdullah Gul, another Islamist who worked with Mr. Erdogan to found the A.K.P. more than a decade ago. Mr. Gul has been seen as a more conciliatory figure than Mr. Erdogan; after his term ends, he could emerge as a candidate for prime minister in the general election next year.Still, most analysts say that if Mr. Erdogan is president, it will matter little who is prime minister.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter whether Erdogan is the prime minister or president,\u201d said Svante E. Cornell, a Turkey analyst and research director at the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute, a research organization. \u201cHe has created an \u2018Erdogan system,\u2019 where power is personalized in his own hands, enabling him to tailor-make the composition of the government to ensure he has the exact kind of influence that he wants.\u201dMr. Erdogan\u2019s presidential ambitions, along with the criticism that he has become increasingly authoritarian by securing more control over the judiciary and the media, have evoked comparisons to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the pre-eminent political figure in his country for nearly 15 years, switching back and forth between the posts of president and prime minister.\u201cRight now, Erdogan is going down a Putinistic route of polarization to consolidate the vote behind him,\u201d said Sinan Ulgen, a Turkey expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Brussels.In accepting his party\u2019s nomination on Tuesday, Mr. Erdogan cast his campaign for the presidency as the final victory over the old Turkish political order, dominated by the secular military and oppressive to the faithful like himself.\u201cIf elected, I will be everyone\u2019s president,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a different type of presidency.\u201d Rather than stick to diplomatic functions, he promised to be a president who \u201csweats, runs around and works hard.\u201dBefore taking the stage, Mr. Erdogan sat in the front row of the audience next to his weeping wife, as a documentary about his life played on a big screen. The scenes of his impoverished youth and his rise in Islamist politics illustrated the dominant theme of his career: the triumph of an underclass of religious conservatives over a secular elite.Mr. Erdogan, who has served three terms as prime minister, is prevented from seeking a fourth by the internal rules of his party. In his time in power, he has been credited with presiding over a growing economy and with advancing the interests of Turks who felt oppressed under the old political order, especially religious conservatives and Kurds. The dominant role of the military ended through a series of trials that are now being reconsidered by the Turkish judicial authorities.But over the last year, he has faced numerous challenges to his rule, and his international standing as a leader who embodied the possibilities of both Islam and democracy has diminished. He and his inner circle have also been caught up in a corruption investigation that he calls a politically motivated smear campaign by supporters of the Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whose followers have, over the years, become entrenched in the judiciary and the police.If he is elected president next month, Mr. Erdogan will have earned a five-year term, but he is not likely to stop there. He has made no secret of his ambition to be the country\u2019s leader in 2023, the 100th anniversary of the modern Turkish republic, built by Ataturk out of the rubble of the Ottoman Empire after World War I.Analysts say his opponents in the election \u2014 Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, a former diplomat nominated by the main secular and nationalist parties, and Selahattin Demirtas, the candidate of a pro-Kurdish party \u2014 have little chance of winning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Risking Another Silent Spring", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe conclusion of the most comprehensive assessment to date of a class of systemic pesticides called neonicotinoids indicates that these chemicals are wreaking much more environmental havoc than previously thought. The report, published last Tuesday by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, asserts there is no longer any doubt that neonicotinoids are a key factor in the dramatic decline of pollinator populations around the world.To protect bees, vital pollinators of food crops, the European Commission approved a temporary ban on the use of three neonicotinoid pesticides last year. Syngenta and Bayer CropScience, which produce these chemicals, have filed legal challenges to the ban with the European Court of Justice. Industry stakeholders and some scientists reject the connection between neonicotinoids and bee deaths, arguing that these chemicals are safe. Yet most scientists believe that while multiple factors account for the die-offs, including loss of habitat and viruses, the connection to neonicotinoids is indisputable.  Beyond affecting bees, the report says, neonicotinoids disrupt the ability of earthworms to tunnel and aerate soil, and harm a wide variety of insects including freshwater snails, butterflies, mosquitoes and the dragonflies that eat them. Nothing less than the world\u2019s ability to produce food, the report warns, is at risk from these chemicals.President Obama recognized the urgent need for action when, on June 20, he ordered the establishment of a Pollinator Health Task Force charged with creating a national strategy to protect pollinators. The president\u2019s memorandum cites the potentially serious impact of pollinator loss on the United States economy, and calls for increasing pollinator habitat and raising public awareness.

The practical consequence is increasing consolidation of Internet-based services and little real choice for consumers.Consider Facebook\u2019s recent acquisition of WhatsApp, the popular messaging service, or Google\u2019s purchase of Nest, the smart home thermostat company. Both of the target companies had offered strong privacy safeguards to consumers. Now they \u2014 and the data of their users \u2014 will simply be subsumed in the larger companies.Much is said about the use of these platforms to promote democracy and human rights in the Middle East, China and Russia. But hardly a word is spoken when these companies prevent their own users from expressing criticism.Political institutions today are not well equipped to deal with the realities of the modern Internet economy. Change is happening quickly. The benefits are oftentimes dazzling, and to many policy leaders disorienting. But there is a real need for a more thoughtful, critical examination of current business practices. The writer is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center and has been active in Internet governance issues for more than 20 years.Readers ReactThere is no one more committed or passionate about online issues than Marc Rotenberg, but I don\u2019t share his pessimism about the future of the Internet. The barriers to entry for new and better online companies are low, and consumers are fickle. By the millions, consumers vote online for their preferred company with the click of a mouse.The so-called behemoths now are competing on privacy. In a few short years, we have seen literally millions of new apps offering new services to consumers \u2014 many privacy-enhancing. And most exciting is the emergence of new tools that promise great features and more user control, at start-ups and behemoths alike. Watchdogs like Mr. Rotenberg are keeping the pressure on, and that\u2019s a good thing. They should take heart that there is a hopeful future for privacy and the Internet. The writer is the founder and co-chairman of the Future of Privacy Forum and a lawyer focusing on privacy issues.One reason companies such as Google may not be facing as much political resistance here as they are in Europe is that they have gotten heavily engaged in the political process, on both the state and federal levels, and on both sides of the aisle.Since 2012 Google has spent an average of $1.4 million per month on federal lobbying \u2014 ranking third in lobbying spending among all companies, according to OpenSecrets.Ironically, the company that is making the world\u2019s information more accessible is secretive about its own political practices. Google should join tech peers such as Microsoft in disclosing more about its lobbying campaigns and its funding of politically active nonprofits, as some shareholders urged at the company\u2019s annual meeting. The writer is communications officer at U.S. Chamber Watch, a project of Public Citizen.Consumers have repeatedly patronized companies knocked for controversial business practices. Post a comment to your Facebook \u201cwall\u201d about Wal-Mart, Starbucks, Foxconn, Microsoft, Monsanto or any other newsmaker to glimpse these criticisms. For the sake of low prices and convenience, we\u2019ve condoned business practices that go against our principles and harm others and, occasionally, ourselves.And now, for the sake of low prices, free services and convenience provided by Internet titans, we\u2019re doing the same thing. Is it time yet to reassess our priorities?Mr. Rotenberg\u2019s assessment that our political institutions are not well equipped to deal with Internet realities is correct. We are at a key regulatory moment. Now is the moment to educate our policy makers. We have a chance for a far-seeing policy that puts long-term public need ahead of short-term private profit. To aim only for the bottom line is to aim too low. The writer is director of the Bernard L. Schwartz Center for Media, Public Policy and Education at Fordham University and president emeritus of WNET public television.Mr. Rotenberg\u2019s letter delivers a welcome breath of clarity and fresh air, but it does not go far enough. The \u201cbehemoths\u201d that we have to cope with in the United States include the broadband oligopoly of Comcast, Verizon and AT&T.The most dangerous scenario is one in which the web giants, such as Google, Facebook and Netflix, collude with the big broadband operators in order to strike deals for the delivery of their services over these operators\u2019 networks that are beneficial to them (as Netflix has already done), while unreasonably discriminating against smaller Internet companies with no or little negotiating power, and further increasing consumers\u2019 costs. In other words, today\u2019s winners will pull up the ladder to inhibit the next wave of innovative entrepreneurs. The writer is a telecommunications consultant.Facebook recently experimented with its users by modifying their news feeds, and concluded that manipulation of the news feed modified the mood of the user. Facebook seems to consider that it has ownership of its users\u2019 data and no obligations that aren\u2019t voluntary.The Internet itself should be regulated as a public utility. We need a national conversation on the rights of users and how to promote competition rather than looking away as the big companies eat up all the potential innovators that might provide competition. Since so many of the privacy problems are driven by the need for advertising revenue, it would be nice to have more for-pay players, with no ads.Mr. Rotenberg\u2019s observation that network effects allow large Internet companies like Google, Facebook and Netflix to dominate their markets has implications far beyond the privacy issues he cites.The \u201cnet neutrality\u201d debate raging in the United States proceeds from the assumption that Internet providers \u2014 cable, fiber, wireless and modern D.S.L. \u2014 are monopolies that can bully hapless content-providing companies. But these companies have far greater market power. Google controls 88 percent of the market for search, and Facebook and YouTube together control more than 80 percent of all social media, for example.From Facebook to Kickstarter, these services are so powerful and popular that no I.S.P. could market a network without unimpeded access to them all. A provider that discriminated against Netflix or Ebay in favor of its own offerings would lose customers by the droves.Google started in a garage, but now has a market value about seven times that of General Motors. The power of the Internet companies that Mr. Rotenberg identifies makes clear they don\u2019t need regulatory help. The writer is president of ESC Company, an economics consulting firm, and former under secretary of commerce in the Clinton administration.The Writer RespondsI once would have agreed with Mr. Wolf\u2019s view, but the evidence increasingly points in a different direction. Instead of innovators displacing incumbents, today incumbents are acquiring innovators. Federal agencies that once pursued major cases to protect consumer privacy have since dropped the ball on enforcement. Little has been done to stop the downward spiral of privacy policies and the increasing profiling of Internet users.Mr. Jewler points to a deeper problem that should trouble many \u2014 the institutions of government and the media itself are being transformed by the companies that should be the focus of public scrutiny. The United States has a long history of reining in the excesses of private power, but that requires effective government and an independent media. Both are increasingly within the gravitational pull of the large Internet companies.Of course, I agree with Mr. Baker about the need for long-term policies that promote growth and innovation, while safeguarding privacy and consumer rights. That is the direction we need to head. But the clock is ticking. Consolidation is accelerating. The titans are already taking steps to block competition in markets that do not yet exist. Google is trying to buy many of the new Internet top-level domains \u2014 \u201c.books,\u201d \u201c.movies,\u201d \u201c.family,\u201d \u201c.love\u201d and \u201c.earth.\u201d Facebook, as Ms. de Saint Phalle noted, is now manipulating the news users see to make them happy and sad.My letter only scratched the surface of the growing threats to the open Internet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Evolution of Trust", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019m one of those people who thought Airbnb would never work. I thought people would never rent out space in their homes to near strangers. But I was clearly wrong. Eleven million travelers have stayed in Airbnb destinations, according to data shared by the company. Roughly 550,000 homes are now being shared by hosts. Airbnb is more popular in Europe than it is even in the United States. Paris is the largest destination city. And Airbnb is only a piece of the peer-to-peer economy. People are renting out their cars to people they don\u2019t know, dropping off their pets with people they don\u2019t know, renting power tools to people they don\u2019t know.In retrospect, I underestimated the power of a few trends that make the peer-to-peer economy possible. First, I underestimated the effects of middle-class stagnation. With wages flat and families squeezed, many people have to return to the boardinghouse model of yesteryear. They have to rent out rooms to cover their mortgage or rent.Second, I underestimated the power that liberal arts majors would have on the economy. Millions of people have finished college with a hunger for travel and local contact, but without much money. They would rather stay in spare rooms in residential neighborhoods than in homogenized hotels in commercial areas, especially if they get to have breakfast with the hosts in the morning. And the big thing I underestimated was the transformation of social trust. In primitive economies, people traded mostly with members of their village and community. Trust was face to face. Then, in the mass economy we\u2019ve been used to, people bought from large and stable corporate brands, whose behavior was made more reliable by government regulation. But now there is a new trust calculus, powered by both social and economic forces. Socially, we have large numbers of people living loose unstructured lives, mostly in the 10 years after leaving college and in the 10 years after retirement. These people often live alone or with short-time roommates, outside big institutional structures, like universities, corporations or the settled living of family life. They become very fast and fluid in how they make social connections. They become accustomed to instant intimacy, or at least fast pseudo-intimacy. People are both hungrier for human contact and more tolerant of easy-come-easy-go fluid relationships.Economically, there are many more people working as freelancers. These people are more individualistic in how they earn money. They often don\u2019t go to an office. They have traded dependence on big organizational systems for dependence on people they can talk to and negotiate arrangements with directly. They become accustomed to flexible ad-hoc arrangements.The result is a personalistic culture in which people have actively lost trust in big institutions. Strangers don\u2019t seem especially risky by comparison. This is fertile ground for peer-to-peer commerce.Companies like Airbnb establish trust through ratings mechanisms. Their clients are already adept at evaluating each other on the basis of each other\u2019s Facebook pages. People in the Airbnb economy don\u2019t have the option of trusting each other on the basis of institutional affiliations, so they do it on the basis of online signaling and peer evaluations. Online ratings follow you everywhere, so people have an incentive to act in ways that will buff their online reputation.As companies like Airbnb, Lyft and Sidecar get more mature, they also spend more money policing their own marketplace. They hire teams to hunt out fraud. They screen suppliers. They look for bad apples who might ruin the experience. The one thing the peer-to-peer economy has not relied on much so far is government regulation. The people who use these companies may be mostly political progressives, but they are operating in a lightly regulated economic space. They vote left, but click right.As this sector matures, government is getting more involved. City officials have clashed with Airbnb and Uber on a range of issues. But most city governments don\u2019t seem inclined to demand tight regulations and oversight. Centralized agencies don\u2019t know what to make of decentralized trust networks. Moreover, in most cities people seem to understand this is a less formal economy and caveat emptor rules to a greater degree. Meanwhile, companies like Airbnb and even Uber seem inclined to compromise and play nice with city governments. They\u2019re trying to establish reputations as good citizens, to play nice with bureaucrats and co-op boards; they can\u2019t do that with in-your-face, disruptive tactics.We\u2019re probably entering a world in which some sectors, like energy, retain top-down regulatory regimes. Other sectors, like bake sales, are unregulated. But more sectors, like peer-to-peer, exist in a gray zone in between.As mechanisms to establish private trust become more efficient, government plays a smaller role. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eduard Shevardnadze, Foreign Minister Under Gorbachev, Dies at 86", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis spokeswoman, Marina Davitashvili, confirmed the death but gave no details.Mr. Shevardnadze was forced from office in 2003 in what was called the Rose Revolution, in which Georgians vented their frustration with the corrupt post-Soviet system that he had presided over and under which he had grown wealthy. His ouster set in motion a period of government reform that saw Georgia become a darling of the West under his successor, Mikheil Saakashvili.Mr. Shevardnadze had spent his working life as a Communist official when Mr. Gorbachev, an old friend, called him on June 30, 1985, with a proposition that startled him: Would he manage the foreign policy of one of the two most powerful countries in the world?As he recounted the call in his memoir, \u201cThe Future Belongs to Freedom\u201d (1991), Mr. Shevardnadze stammered that he had no experience in diplomacy, other than hosting foreign delegations as the top Communist official in the Soviet republic of Georgia. He had visited just nine countries and spoke no foreign languages. Besides, he asked Mr. Gorbachev, shouldn\u2019t the foreign minister be Russian?\u201cThe issue is already decided,\u201d Mr. Gorbachev answered. Mr. Shevardnadze was to report to work the next day.\u201cThe decision to make Shevardnadze foreign minister was the first obvious display of Gorbachev\u2019s remarkable political creativity,\u201d Robert G. Kaiser wrote in \u201cWhy Gorbachev Happened: His Triumphs, His Failure, and His Fall\u201d (1991).In his 1995 book \u201cMemoirs,\u201d Mr. Gorbachev said \u201cexperienced people\u201d had understood his thinking \u2014 that he had assured himself \u201ca free hand in foreign policy by bringing in a close friend and associate.\u201dTogether, the two men revolutionized Soviet foreign policy. They withdrew troops from Afghanistan, where the Soviet Union had waged a fruitless war; negotiated treaties on medium-range and strategic nuclear arms; took military forces out of Europe and away from the China border; allowed the reunification of Germany; and accepted human rights as part of policy discussions.Mr. Shevardnadze was architect, spokesman and negotiator for the new foreign policy, and the white-haired visage that earned him the nickname Silver Fox was nearly ubiquitous on the world stage from 1985 to 1991. The magazine The New Leader said in 2004 that his diplomatic accomplishments had been equal to those of Mr. Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan.Part of his success was forging relationships with Secretaries of State George P. Shultz and James A. Baker III, who became proponents of reconciliation in intensely anti-Soviet administrations (Mr. Shultz under Reagan, Mr. Baker under the elder George Bush). Just as difficult, he helped convince Soviet hard-liners that it was time for rapprochement with the United States.Mr. Shevardnadze, meanwhile, was in the process of renouncing Communism, which he had come to believe was both wrong and doomed. In 1988, he was the first Soviet official to say that the clash with capitalism no longer mattered. The statement was an act of \u201ctrue \u2018sedition\u2019 in the eyes of the official ideologues,\u201d Mr. Gorbachev wrote in \u201cMemoirs.\u201dMr. Shevardnadze\u2019s revisionist thinking outpaced that of Mr. Gorbachev, whose title was general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. \u201cHe thought he was refining socialism while I was no longer a socialist,\u201d Mr. Shevardnadze told The New York Times Magazine in 1993.Mr. Shevardnadze became worried that Mr. Gorbachev was falling under the influence of the hard-liners. He ultimately shocked his boss by resigning on Dec. 20, 1990, warning, \u201cDictatorship is coming.\u201d After a botched coup attempt by hard-liners in August 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved itself on Dec. 26, 1991, a victim of economic chaos, political opposition from many of its constituent republics and turmoil in the Kremlin.Three months later, Mr. Shevardnadze agreed to head the council governing Georgia after a coup there. He was elected president in 1995 and helped hold his country together as it established democratic reforms and stabilized the economy.He survived assassination attempts in 1992, 1995 and 1998 without suffering serious injury. The first two attempts involved car bombs; in one, Mr. Shevardnadze was leaving the inner courtyard of the Parliament building in Tbilisi, the capital, when a four-wheel-drive vehicle exploded nearby. The third attempt was an ambush by 10 to 15 armed men in which two presidential body guards and one attacker were killed.His second term, won in 2000, was a disaster, as armed civil clashes proliferated, the economy deteriorated, and cronyism and corruption flourished. Mr. Shevardnadze resigned in November 2003, after protesters\u2019 chants of \u201cGet out! Get out! Get out!\u201dThe proximate cause of his fall was his involvement in rigged elections in 2002 and 2003, a violation of the electoral reform laws that he himself had sponsored. His own Supreme Court invalidated the elections.In a television interview after being driven from office, Mr. Shevardnadze no longer spoke of perestroika or glasnost, the Russian words for rebuilding and openness that Mr. Gorbachev had popularized.\u201cIt is not good to have too much democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that was a mistake.\u201dHis successor, Mr. Saakashvili, said in a telephone interview on Monday that Mr. Shevardnadze had played an \u201cimmense\u201d role in \u201cestablishing the post-Cold War order,\u201d and that as Georgia\u2019s first post-Soviet president, he had steered the country toward democracy, setting it apart from other former Soviet republics. \u201cHe managed to create a more open atmosphere, that gave more intellectual freedom here,\u201d Mr. Saakashvili added.But he noted that Mr. Shevardnadze had incurred resentment as his family accumulated extraordinary wealth.\u201cWhen he came back to Georgia, in many ways he was a tired man,\u201d said Mr. Saakashvili, who left office as Georgia\u2019s president in 2013. \u201cThere was lots of corruption. There was lots of criminality. People remember it as a time when a lot of people in Georgia could not get a lot of electricity. By the time he ended his presidency, he was very wealthy \u2014 his family was the wealthiest \u2014 and that\u2019s a fact of life. It was a very complex time, and it\u2019s up to history to judge.\u201dEduard Amvrosiyevich Shevardnadze was born in the village of Mamati, Georgia, on Jan. 25, 1928. His father was a Russian language teacher who was arrested in Stalin\u2019s purges but saved by a friend in the secret police. The boy threw himself into Communist youth activities and considered Communism his religion. He joined the party in 1948.Resisting his parents\u2019 wishes that he go to medical school, he became a political instructor for Komsomol, the Communist youth organization. While on vacation in 1951 at a Georgian resort, Mr. Shevardnadze met Nanuli Tsagareyshvili, a counselor at a camp for Pioneers, the Communist youth organization for teenagers. He was told by a high-ranking party official that he should not marry her because her father had been arrested as an enemy of the people. The official said that Mr. Shevardnadze would become \u201ca pariah, an outcast,\u201d Mr. Shevardnadze wrote in his memoir.They wed nevertheless, in 1951. \u201cWhy must I sacrifice my love to hatred?\u201d he wrote.She died in 2004. Mr. Shevardnadze is believed to be survived by his son, Pata; his daughter, Monana; and four grandchildren.While working for Komsomol, Mr. Shevardnadze graduated from the Higher Party School of the Communist Party of Georgia, and earned a teaching degree through a correspondence school. He became head of the Georgian Komsomol in 1956 and began his rise through the ranks. He was appointed minister of public order in Georgia in 1965 and interior minister in 1968. Both were internal-security positions under the K.G.B. He developed a reputation for toughness, even cruelty, and was said to torture prisoners.He was also a vocal foe of Georgia\u2019s rampant corruption. On his first day as minister of public order, according to a story circulating at the time, he asked senior officials for a show of hands. He then ordered everyone displaying an expensive black-market watch to take it off and turn it in.In 1972, Mr. Shevardnadze flew to Moscow with a suitcase full of evidence of the corruption of Georgian leadership to show the Soviet leader, Leonid I. Brezhnev. He was rewarded with the job of first secretary of the Communist Party of Georgia. In 1976, he was named to the central committee of the national Communist Party, and two years later became a nonvoting member of the ruling Politburo.Meanwhile he built a network of connections, cultivating top party officials vacationing in Georgia. He became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Yuri Andropov, the longest-serving head of the K.G.B., who succeeded Mr. Brezhnev as the Soviet leader.Mr. Shevardnadze met Mr. Gorbachev in the mid-1960s, when the two were Komsomol officials. They immediately liked each other and began meeting in Moscow, in Georgia and in the Stavropol region, where Mr. Gorbachev led a Komsomol branch.\u201cGradually, unnoticed to ourselves, we opened up to each other, beginning to confide our secret thoughts,\u201d Mr. Shevardnadze wrote. In 1979, after both men learned about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan from newspapers, they privately agreed that it was \u201ca fatal error,\u201d in Mr. Shevardnadze\u2019s words.As foreign minister, Mr. Shevardnadze succeeded Andrei A. Gromyko, who in holding the post for a generation had exemplified the dour image of Soviet diplomats. He took the job with Mr. Gromyko\u2019s approval, which Mr. Gorbachev had won through flattery and a promise to appoint Mr. Gromyko to the ceremonial position of head of state.Mr. Shevardnadze quickly showed diplomatic aplomb. On his first day, he told his deputies: \u201cWho am I compared to Gromyko, the battleship of world foreign policy? I am just a rowboat. But with a motor.\u201dOne of his last acts in the job was to persuade Russia\u2019s leadership to support a United Nations resolution on Nov. 29, 1990, giving the United States and its allies the green light to drive Iraq from Kuwait. Hard-liners were taken aback, blaming Mr. Shevardnadze\u2019s close relationship with Secretary of State Baker. Mr. Baker once sang \u201cGeorgia on My Mind\u201d to his friend \u201cShevy\u201d in a meeting at Jackson Hole, Wyo.After Mr. Shevardnadze resigned, in 1990, Mr. Gorbachev tried several times to persuade him to return as foreign minister. He finally did, in November 1991, for what turned out to be the Soviet Union\u2019s final month.In March 1992, Mr. Shevardnadze was summoned by Georgia\u2019s ruling council to try to bring order to the country after a coup had removed President Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia. He told The Times Magazine that he had known he \u201cwas jumping into a caldron\u201d when he accepted the post of chairman of the State Council of Georgia.Mr. Shevardnadze remained in Georgia after his resignation as president, and commented on Georgian and global affairs as an elder statesman.\u201cPicasso had his different periods, and other artists, too,\u201d he told The Times in 1992, before his second career as president of the new Georgia.\u201cI made mistakes, I was sometimes unfair, but what was one supposed to do \u2014 stick with one position to the end? To the death? We have all changed.\u201dDavid M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Brat\u2019s Hand-of-God Economics", "Date": "2014-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyEven before David Brat\u2019s out-of-nowhere victory against Eric Cantor last month, there was plenty of skepticism about whether he merited the label of academic economist. Brat, a professor at Randolph-Macon College in Virginia, is certainly not in danger of winning a Nobel Prize: He writes discursive papers devoid of math; he has cited Wikipedia as a source; and he has never been published in a significant journal. But his big idea \u2014 that Protestantism is good for the economy \u2014 has a surprisingly distinguished history.The financial crisis of 2008 shook an abiding faith in the free markets that had dominated policy making for a generation. Liberals responded by calling for increased regulation. Conservatives, distrustful of both Wall Street and government, have struggled to articulate their own alternative. But Brat, who describes himself as a \u201c100 percent free-market-Milton-Friedman-Chicago-School-Hayek economist,\u201d saw confirmation of his longstanding idea that markets are perfect places inhabited by imperfect beings. On the campaign trail, Brat declared that bankers should have gone to jail and that \u201ccrony capitalists,\u201d like Cantor, had undermined the system. \u201cI\u2019m not against business,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m against big business in bed with big government.\u201dInstead of arguing for any specific regulation, however, Brat said that the system simply needed more virtue. \u201cWe should love our neighbor so much that we actually believe in right and wrong and do something about it,\u201d he wrote in a 2011 essay for Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and Theology. \u201cIf we all did the right thing and had the guts to spread the word, we would not need the government to backstop every action we take.\u201dThe idea that religion plays a role in economic growth was most famously advocated by the German sociologist Max Weber. In his 1905 book, \u201cThe Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,\u201d he argued that Protestant countries developed more quickly because they embraced hard work as a virtue. Over the decades, others have continued to see merit in the theory, including J. Bradford DeLong, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who presented statistical evidence for it in a 1988 paper. Even Friedrich Hayek, a professed agnostic, grudgingly acknowledged the role of religion. \u201cLike it or not,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cwe owe the persistence of certain practices, and the civilization that resulted from them, in part to support from beliefs which are not true.\u201dWeber\u2019s view has since fallen out of favor, but Brat, who studied at a Presbyterian seminary before pursuing a degree in economics, has tried to carry on an extreme variant of this tradition anyway. In his doctoral thesis at American University, \u201cHuman Capital, Religion and Economic Growth,\u201d he argued that Protestant countries grew more quickly because they were particularly supportive of scientific exploration. The role of religion was \u201cnot large compared to other factors,\u201d but ignoring it would \u201cbe a significant omission.\u201d Over the years, he has grown only more convinced of his views. \u201cThe one source of economic growth is virtue,\u201d he told The Richmond Times-Dispatch last year. \u201cIt is not property rights, not law or resources, but virtue.\u201dBrat\u2019s political success suggests a fundamental evolution in the Republican Party. During the late 1990s, Senator Phil Gramm and Representative Dick Armey, former economics professors, played key roles in the government\u2019s deregulation of the financial industry. Gramm helped write the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which cleared the way for the emergence of financial supermarkets, like Citigroup, that offered banking and brokerage and insurance services. Armey, as the House majority leader, was a noted deficit hawk.But neither of them identified closely with the Christian right. Free-market economists, after all, are explicit that companies are held accountable by customers, competitors and shareholders: They don\u2019t need the government\u2019s help, and they don\u2019t need God\u2019s either. Religious voters effectively ended Gramm\u2019s bid for the presidency in early 1996, when he was upset by Pat Buchanan in the Louisiana caucus. And Armey, who left Congress in 2003, has continued to argue that some of the Christian right\u2019s views are at odds with a libertarian commitment to individual freedom. \u201cWhen the social conservatives and the economic conservatives work well together is when they work with a common resistance to the growth of the power of the state,\u201d Armey said in 2010. \u201cMy point is very simple: You live a righteous life, you\u2019re an encouragement to other people; use the state to impose it, and you\u2019re a tyrant.\u201dBut whereas the Republican Party was once a coalition of capitalists and Christians, it\u2019s increasingly populated by people who profess belief in both. David E. Campbell, a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, has found a significant overlap between the Tea Party and the religious right. In 2006, Campbell and his collaborator, Robert D. Putnam, a professor of public policy at Harvard University, interviewed about 3,000 Americans. When most were interviewed again, in 2011, the professors found that the people most likely to identify with the Tea Party were those who previously wanted religion to play a large role in government. Campbell said that it made sense that people who came of age when the Republican Party was a coalition of those two things are now forming a generation that \u201cis just going to believe in both things.\u201dBrat may be a politician for his time, but it is hard to have faith that religion holds the answer to our economic problems. Bankers continue to behave badly, but the markets break down even when participants are virtuous. Government regulation isn\u2019t meant to substitute for failed virtue. It\u2019s there to make markets work.Binyamin Appelbaum is an economics reporter for\nThe Times.Deep Thoughts:\n1. David Brat isn\u2019t going to win a Nobel Prize\nin economics. 2. But he is hardly the\nfirst to argue that religion is good for growth.\n3. Unfortunately, faith is not enough.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rules for Money Market Funds Arrive, Finally", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRegulatory ChallengeThe fact that it has taken so long to put in rules to try to make the sector less prone to 2008-style runs \u2014 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules Wednesday on a 3-to-2 vote \u2014 is a depressing indication of the challenges that stand in the way of creating a more stable financial system.Yet one of the dangers that regulators have to watch for is that, even as they cut back on risk in big banks, risk might find its way to other places, like squeezing the air out of one side of a balloon. Making the Citigroups and Goldman Sachses of the world more stable will prove a Pyrrhic victory if it leads to other unregulated parts of the financial system becoming bigger and riskier.While the major banks were key transmission nodes in the 2008 crisis, for example, it was rooted in important ways in the \u201cshadow banking sector,\u201d particularly the funding of home mortgages through complex, little-regulated securities. Members of this sector look like a bank, act like a bank, but aren\u2019t regulated like a bank.The big question for the future of the financial system is whether regulators and lawmakers will be better than they have been in the recent past at identifying when an unregulated segment of the financial system is in some way endangering the rest of us, and then doing something about it.Money market mutual funds were the original shadow bank. People invest in them, paying a dollar a share, and can pull their money out pretty much any time (much like a bank deposit). The fund invests that money in short-term debt instruments of companies and the government (not too different from bank loans). The differences: There is no government insurance on the safety of deposits, no regulator-required capital buffer to protect against losses, no central bank ready to stand as \u201clender of last resort\u201d to keep a money-market fund from suffering a short-term cash crunch.Well, that\u2019s the theory anyway.What actually happened back in the fall of 2008 is that one money fund, the Reserve Primary Fund, \u201cbroke the buck,\u201d or informed its investors that their shares would no longer be worth the $1 each that was widely assumed. As investors yanked billions from money market funds, the risk was that it would cause a funding crunch for the banks and large companies that rely on them for funding, creating a cascading series of failures that would severely damage the rest of the economy.So the Treasury and Federal Reserve deployed various emergency authorities to backstop the money market mutual funds. They weren\u2019t supposed to have deposit insurance or a lender of last resort, but when push came to shove, they got just that.Ever since then, the S.E.C., the government regulator of the mutual fund industry, has been under pressure to put in place rules to try to make money market mutual funds less vulnerable to a future run. It has considered having floating net asset values (that is, to have their value routinely move around, rather than be permanently set at $1, creating the risk of breaking the buck) or having a capital buffer to protect against losses.The reactions to the new rules are along the lines you might expect: financial trade groups fretting that it may unduly constrain an investment product that Americans like, and consumer groups fretting that it doesn\u2019t go far enough.But to me the key lesson is this: Even when a sector of the shadow banking system has clearly exhibited vulnerability and has been studied every which way for decades, it will take years of bureaucratic infighting to put in place rules to reform it.That doesn\u2019t bode well for our financial regulators\u2019 ability to combat new risks to the financial system that emerge in the future, coming out of the shadows, their risks unknowable and theoretical, and their advocates well funded.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Says Lending Put Growth Rate at 7.5 Percent", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China announced on Wednesday morning that its economy grew 7.5 percent in the second quarter, marginally better than expected, as a wave of lending unleashed by the central bank helped local governments continue investment projects even as housing construction remained very weak.The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing also released figures on Wednesday showing that industrial production and fixed-asset investment strengthened slightly more than expected in June while retail sales growth slowed slightly, as the heavy lending appears to have headed off or at least delayed a widely expected broader slowdown of the Chinese economy.But that lending has come at the price of adding further to the country\u2019s considerable domestic debt burden, which has been rising steeply ever since the Chinese government resorted to very heavy monetary stimulus in early 2009 so as to limit the effects of the global financial crisis.Western economists had estimated that the Chinese economy grew 7.4 percent in the second quarter, the same as the first quarter. Similarly, industrial production grew 9.2 percent in June from a year ago instead of the expected 9 percent and fixed-asset investment increased 17.3 percent for the first half of the year, compared with forecasts of 17.2 percent.But growth in retail sales was 12.4 percent in June, instead of matching May\u2019s figure of 12.5 percent, as economists had expected. The People\u2019s Bank of China released on figures on Tuesday showing that bank lending jumped in June from a year earlier, and a category called total social financing, which includes many forms of so-called shadow banking, increased even faster. The central bank has encouraged commercial banks to direct more of these loans to small and medium-size enterprises, which have long struggled for credit. But many businesspeople in China say that the real beneficiaries of greater lending, as in the past, have been state-owned enterprises and local governments.Many economists still expect the Chinese economy to slow further as housing prices begin to deflate after soaring for most of the last three decades. Wang Tao, an economist at UBS, predicted on Monday that growth would decelerate to 6.8 percent next year, with a 15 percent chance that it would fall closer to 5 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Growing Arsenal of Homegrown Rockets Encounters Israel\u2019s Iron Dome ", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 For the moment at least, the hostilities between Israel and Gaza are partly a fight between rockets and interceptors \u2014 between the varied and improved arsenal of rockets possessed by Hamas and its allies, like Islamic Jihad, and the antimissile systems of Israel.If Hamas and Islamic Jihad are proud of their steady technical achievements in building homegrown versions of rockets capable of hitting Tel Aviv and even the outskirts of Jerusalem, the Israelis consider their Iron Dome antimissile system a battlefield-altering success, helping to protect the home front and buy time for either negotiations or a ground operation.A major part of the Israeli military strategy is air power, to be sure, with frequent strikes on Gaza from jet fighters and drones, aimed at Hamas officials, headquarters, rocket factories, launchers and arms stores, the Israeli Army says. However well-targeted the strikes, there is almost always collateral damage. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, at least 40 Palestinians in crowded Gaza are reported to have died so far since Monday night, some of them youngsters and not all of them combatants. No Israelis have been killed.The Israeli intent, as described by military officials, is to degrade the capacity and will of Hamas and its allies to continue firing rockets, and to diminish the stock of rockets the Gazans currently possess.The Israeli military said Wednesday that more than 200 rockets fired from Gaza had hit Israel, while 53 had been intercepted by the Iron Dome system. Some have hit in or near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and even Hadera, 70 miles north of Gaza.That reach indicates a new level in this round of hostilities compared with those in November 2012. But more important, the Israelis say, is the quantity of more sophisticated rockets the Gazans have been able to attain through manufacture and smuggling, especially before the military crackdown in Egypt a year ago that overthrew the elected president there, Mohamed Morsi, who was considered an ally of Hamas, which is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood.Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad have a range of rocketry now, from the small and relatively inaccurate 122-millimeter rockets of the Grad family, which have short ranges of 12 to 25 miles, to some Syrian-manufactured M-302 rockets, which have a range of about 100 miles, like the one that hit Hadera. But Hamas also has accrued a large stock of Iranian Fajr-5 rockets and a locally made version that Hamas calls the M-75 (for a range of 75 kilometers). These 333-millimeter rockets have a range of about 50 miles, covering central Israel.Only in March, Israeli forces intercepted a ship in the southern Red Sea, 1,000 miles from Israel, that contained a shipment of M-302s that the Israelis said had been intended for their militant adversaries in Gaza. Israel blamed Iran, which supports Hamas and Islamic Jihad, for the shipment. They denied the Israeli accusation. Gen. Itay Brun, head of the Military Intelligence Analysis and Production Unit of the Israel Defense Forces, said in June that the technical expertise in Gaza to manufacture the medium-range rockets also came from Iran. He estimated that Hamas\u2019s stock of rockets had about doubled since November 2012, the last time Israel and Hamas engaged in prolonged hostilities, and had been improved, with more longer-range rockets.According to General Brun, Hamas has several hundred rockets with ranges of up to about 50 miles, which can reach the outskirts of Jerusalem; several thousand rockets with ranges up to 25 miles, many made in China, which can reach Beersheba, Ashdod and other parts of southern Israel; and several thousand rockets with ranges of 12 miles, which can reach the closer Israeli populations in Sderot and Ashkelon.The Iron Dome system is intended to intercept these rockets \u2014 not more sophisticated cruise missiles, which the Gaza militants are not believed to possess \u2014 before they reach populated areas. Guided by computers and sensors, the interceptors are supposed to be fired only when population centers are in danger; they fire explosive metal pieces in proximity to the rocket to destroy the warhead. Two interceptors are fired toward each rocket that approaches a significant target.The Israeli Army has said that the system intercepted about 27 percent of all the rockets fired between Monday night and midday Wednesday.The United States has been instrumental in helping to fund the development of Iron Dome and has proprietary access to the technology. Israel has said that the system has a success rate of nearly 90 percent in intercepting the missiles it is meant to thwart.Some outside analysts have said they consider such claims to be exaggerated, in part because some missiles are simply diverted off their course to land elsewhere and the warheads are not destroyed. Israeli officials dismiss some of the criticism as motivated by competitors, but whatever the actual success figures, the system has clearly protected many Israeli towns and cities and has helped somewhat to calm the nerves of Israeli civilians.Still, most open-air activities with large numbers of people have been banned by the army, including those in Jerusalem, and numerous cultural events and street fairs have been canceled.The civilians of Gaza, of course, among whom Hamas operates, live in a different reality.Israel currently has seven Iron Dome batteries, which cost $55 million each; each interceptor costs about $100,000, officials say.The system also \u201cchanges the calculus on the battlefield,\u201d Mr. Oren said. \u201cIt buys you time to work out a cease-fire, but also can prevent a clear victory \u2014 it depends on who has greater stocks of rockets or interceptors.\u201dThere is a cost-benefit debate, Mr. Oren said. A Hamas rocket is inexpensive, whether it is made locally or smuggled \u201cduty-free,\u201d he said. But the savings to civilian property and the economy must be set against the cost of the system, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Teenagers Today May Grow Up Conservative", "Date": "2014-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPulse of the PeopleThere was a time not so long ago when the young seemed destined to be liberal forever. Americans in their teens and 20s were to the left of their elders on social issues. They worried more about poverty. They voted strongly Democratic.But the temporary nature of the 1960s should serve as a reminder that politics change. What seems permanent can become fleeting. And the Democratic Party, for all its strengths among Americans under 40, has some serious vulnerabilities, too.The generation that came of age during the five presidential terms of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman leaned Democratic for its entire life. So have those young liberals of the 1960s, who learned American politics through the glamour of John F. Kennedy. The babies of the late 1960s and early 1970s, who entered political consciousness during the Reagan years, lean Republican. Think Alex P. Keaton, the conservative child of hippies from the 1980s sitcom \u201cFamily Ties.\u201dAmong today\u2019s teenagers, Democrats do start with some big advantages. For one thing, the next generation of voters is an ethnically diverse group: About 45 percent of American citizens in their teenage years are either Latino or a member of a racial minority, compared with only 29 percent of citizens 20 and older.His point was that Hispanic voters would follow the same political path as earlier immigrant groups, like Italians and Irish, and move right as they assimilated.People\u2019s political views are particularly shaped by events they experience between 14 and 24.With that advantage, however, comes a funny kind of problem. The Democrats are the majority party when the country is in a bit of a funk.This dynamic is likely to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest weakness, either as a candidate or as a president. Talking about the Clinton-era 1990s boom \u2014 as she\u2019ll surely do, to distance herself from today\u2019s economy \u2014 will go only so far with voters too young to have any memories of the 1990s.By any measure, Mr. Obama\u2019s second term lacks the political drama of his first, when Democrats were passing sweeping legislation and the Tea Party sprang up in reaction. But the generational nature of politics means that the second Obama term still has enormous political import.If he can execute his basic goals \u2014 if the economy improves and his health care, education and climate policies all seem to be basically working \u2014 it will pay political dividends for decades to come. We may not yet know who will be running for president in, say, 2024. We do know that Mr. Obama, like his predecessors, will still cast a shadow over the campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen Tells Congress That Fed Will Continue to Prop Up the Economy", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told Congress on Tuesday that the financial markets remained in reasonable health despite signs of bubbles in some areas, including the stocks of social media and technology companies.In her testimony, Ms. Yellen \u2014 reinforced by a separate report from the Fed \u2014 said that valuations of assets including junk bonds and shares in smaller tech companies appeared \u201cstretched,\u201d but that the Fed did not plan to curtail its economic stimulus campaign in response.In response to her comments, the stock market dipped mildly, with declines concentrated in the tech sectors Ms. Yellen highlighted.Ms. Yellen, in playing down concerns about financial stability, said the economic recovery remained incomplete and the Fed\u2019s help was necessary.\u201cToo many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective and not all of the necessary financial reform initiatives have been completed,\u201d Ms. Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee.Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony is likely to reinforce a sense of complacency among investors who regard the Fed as convinced of its forecast and committed to its policy course. She reiterated the Fed\u2019s view that the economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace, and that the Fed is in no hurry to start increasing short-term interest rates.When Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, asked Ms. Yellen about the greatest risks to that growth forecast, she seemed flummoxed by the question, eventually reiterating the Fed\u2019s confidence that growth would continue.Fed officials including Ms. Yellen have said that they are puzzled by the lack of volatility in financial markets, suggesting that investors have developed an unwarranted degree of confidence about the Fed\u2019s intentions.Ms. Yellen restated that point Tuesday, telling the committee, \u201cThe outlook for the economy and financial markets is never certain, and now is no exception.\u201dBut that uncertainty about the future is actually contributing to the sense of stability, by making the Fed more cautious about retreating. Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony suggested the Fed\u2019s leadership remained largely unmoved by the arguments of some Fed officials and outside economists that monetary policy has done what it can to stimulate the economy, and that the Fed is in danger of risking excessive inflation in the future by waiting too long to start raising interest rates.\u201cThe Federal Reserve does need to be quite cautious with respect to monetary policy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cWe have in the past seen false dawns.\u201dThe Fed plans to end one part of its stimulus campaign, the expansion of its bond holdings, in October, but Ms. Yellen stressed its plans to keep short-term interest rates near zero for some time. She noted the Fed\u2019s recent efforts to plan its eventual retreat \u201cdo not imply any imminent change in the stance of monetary policy.\u201dMs. Yellen appeared before the Senate committee to present the Fed\u2019s biannual report on monetary policy. She will testify before a House committee on Wednesday.The economy shrank sharply in the first quarter, but Ms. Yellen emphasized the Fed\u2019s overall view that growth has since resumed \u2014 although she added that \u201cthis bears close watching\u201d \u2014 and pointed to its forecast that the economy would continue to grow \u201cat a moderate pace over the next several years.\u201dThe decline in the unemployment rate, meanwhile, has exceeded expectations, reaching 6.1 percent in June, but Ms. Yellen maintained her view that the decline was overstating the progress of the labor market. Some people who stopped looking for work are likely to return as the economy improves, she said. Wage growth also remains weak, suggesting employers still find it easy to replace workers.Ms. Yellen also spoke about the \u201cserious psychological toll\u201d of unemployment and its long-term costs, underscoring her commitment to the Fed\u2019s efforts.Inflation also remains sluggish, suggesting that the economy continues to operate below capacity, and allowing the Fed to extend its stimulus campaign. \u201cWith wages growing slowly and raw material prices generally flat or moving downward, firms are not facing much in the way of cost pressures that they might otherwise try to pass on,\u201d the Fed said in a report accompanying Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony.But Ms. Yellen added that the Fed was ready to respond if it concluded that it had overestimated the slack in the labor market, a more substantial acknowledgment of the views of her critics than she has made in other recent remarks.\u201cIf the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the committee, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned,\u201d Ms. Yellen told the Senate committee. \u201cConversely, if economic performance is disappointing, then the future path of interest rates likely would be more accommodative than currently anticipated.\u201dThe Fed also remains watchful for signs of financial instability, Ms. Yellen said. Valuations in most sectors \u201cremain generally in line with historical norms,\u201d but there is evidence of overconfidence in sectors including junk bonds, she said.The Fed, in a biannual report accompanying Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony, also cited social media and biotechnology stocks as potentially overvalued.Ms. Yellen has said that concerns about financial stability are not sufficient, at present, to warrant a shift in the course of monetary policy.Ms. Yellen faced tough questioning about financial regulation from several Democratic senators. The sharpest questions closed the hearing.Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, asked Ms. Yellen whether JPMorgan Chase had complied with a legal requirement to provide the Fed with a credible plan for its orderly dissolution, should that become necessary.\u201cCan you honestly say that JPMorgan could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion with no threats to the economy and no need for a taxpayer bailout?,\u201d Ms. Warren asked.When Ms. Yellen avoided the question, Ms. Warren persisted, \u201cHave they ever gotten to a plan that you can say with a straight face is credible?\u201dMs. Yellen demurred again and the hearing ended.Ms. Warren walked over to Ms. Yellen and kissed her cheek. The two women laughed, and chatted, and left.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boston Ballet Visits New York With a Bulging Suitcase", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDance ReviewThe company opened its season last week at the Koch Theater with a triple bill of works in which it was hard to care who was dancing, since each ballet made its performers look insincere, horrid or foolish. With the four highly dissimilar ballets of program B, on Friday, things became far more complex.In Balanchine\u2019s high-energy, structurally elaborate \u201cSymphony in Three Movements\u201d (1972), the dancers had a worthy challenge. The ballet had its premiere in this very theater as part of City Ballet\u2019s Stravinsky Festival and has been regularly danced there by that company ever since. Nijinsky\u2019s \u201cAfternoon of a Faun\u201d (1912), extraordinarily concentrated in focus, is largely two-dimensional in physical style (the dancers perpetually move through bas-relief positions). Though historic for its stylistic economy and sexual audacity (it reaches its peak in an act of fetishism), and extraordinary in the lavish color and atmosphere of its designs by Leon Bakst, it is seldom seen on New York stages; the only other viewing in recent years was when Boston Ballet brought it to the Fall for Dance festival at City Center in 2009.The response to music by Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber in Jorma Elo\u2019s \u201cPlan to B\u201d (2004) was grossly exaggerated, especially in terms of dynamics, as if answering Baroque grace with kung fu intensity. (The women did not perform on point.) Even so, it made its six dancers individually arresting; you could understand the ovation they won.Finally, Jiri Kylian\u2019s \u201cBella Figura\u201d (1995) was a deranged, pretentious but harmless array of assorted theatrics. Its effects included, at various points, two effigies of naked people suspended above the stage, curtains rising and falling, taped music by five different composers (from different centuries), bare-breasted women wearing scarlet crinolines, and flames rising from caldrons on either side of the stage. I almost wish the nine dancers had not done it so well; its stage world makes humans look like mere small fry.The Boston dancers largely rose handsomely to the challenge of \u201cSymphony in Three Movements,\u201d with especially fine dancing from Ms. Kuranaga and Jeffrey Cirio. The Boston performance was superior to the way City Ballet danced this piece seven years ago, though it did not show all the drive and eloquence that company has now regained. I nonetheless object to the performance of Lia Cirio, a purposeful leading Boston ballerina, in the central role; in particular, the tremendous tension evident in her neck and face does much to wreck the choreography\u2019s inscrutable grace. \u201cFaun\u201d cast a spell, but Altan Dugaraa\u2019s performance, even more than in 2009, is highly exaggerated: He opens his mouth in far too many snarls, while over-softening the bas-relief style.When I say that \u201cPlan to B\u201d is the best Elo ballet I\u2019ve ever seen, I\u2019m not saying much. Most of the works I\u2019ve seen by him \u2014 he is Boston Ballet\u2019s resident choreographer \u2014 strike me as bad and some of them as nightmarish. But here was \u201cPlan to B,\u201d and in its over-emphatic way, it allowed its six dancers to shine; I single out Dusty Button, Whitney Jensen and, again, Mr. Cirio \u2014 all gleamingly attractive and skilled.This was the most oddly diverse ballet program New York has seen in a long while. I\u2019m among those who think of Nijinsky and Balanchine as master choreographers, and Mr. Elo and Mr. Kylian as objectionable; and yet, all four works challenged any conventional notions of choreographic musicality. \u201cSymphony in Three Movements\u201d is one of the Stravinsky works in which Balanchine\u2019s dances go furthest from the meters we hear; he\u2019s answering the music with other rhythms, other phrasings. The more you analyze it, the stranger it becomes. Yet how can you resist it? The force of its imagination is matched by the inevitability of its construction.The way in which Nijinsky in \u201cFaun\u201d responds to Debussy\u2019s famous \u201cPr\u00e9lude \u00e0 L\u2019Apr\u00e8s-Midi d\u2019un Faune\u201d has always been subject to controversy and individual interpretation. Was Nijinsky responding just to the music\u2019s larger phrasing or also to tiny details within the score? I\u2019ve seen it danced by five different companies. Not only have the five versions differed greatly in matters of musical emphasis and physical tension (How much legato and staccato? How smoothly or jerkily should the dancers move from pose to pose?), but in several cases the same company has also fielded casts that have made strikingly dissimilar answers to these points.Over 20 years ago, at the Paris Opera Ballet, Charles Jude was the best Faun I\u2019ve ever seen, ideal in his firm command of long legato phrases; but at the same time, Kader Belarbi\u2019s choppier, more overtly sexy performance with the same cast was the worst. The Paris version is the source of the Boston one, which is staged by Ghislaine Thesmar; I\u2019d like to see it with another cast.The whole Boston Ballet season here has been an awkward experience. The works by William Forsythe, Jos\u00e9 Martinez, Alexander Ekman, Mr. Elo and Mr. Kylian show unpleasing taste in choreography on the part of the artistic director Mikko Nissinen. The casting of central roles in the Balanchine and Nijinsky works added further problems. It\u2019s to be regretted that some of the company\u2019s finest dancers were not shown in better vehicles, and that, this time, New Yorkers saw so few of its best productions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Budget Office Lowers Its Estimate on Federal Spending for Health Care", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The growth of federal spending on health care will continue to decline as a proportion of the overall economy in the coming decades, in part because of cost controls mandated by President Obama\u2019s health care law, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Tuesday.With the latest revision, the budget office has now reduced its 10-year estimate for spending by Medicare, Medicaid and other health programs by $1.23 trillion starting in 2010, the year the health care law took effect. By 2039, the savings would amount to $250 billion a year today, or about 1.5 percent of the economy.Many factors contributed to the change, including lower anticipated economic growth and a downward projection for interest rates over time. But another factor was a finding that the federal government might be able to sustain a low growth rate of payments to providers in line with requirements set by the health care law.\u201cEvidence suggests that hospitals and other providers may be able to achieve significant productivity gains or to restrain the growth of their costs in some other way,\u201d the C.B.O. report said.Despite the improvement, federal health care spending is still projected to grow faster than any other budget category as baby boomers retire and begin drawing from Medicare. Health care is on track to become the government\u2019s biggest expense by around 2030.Over all, the budget office still sees federal budget deficits and the government\u2019s outstanding debt growing at rates it calls unsustainable. Deficits are projected to remain at their current level of about 3 percent of G.D.P., or about $500 billion \u2014 a level that economists consider maintainable in a growing economy \u2014 through 2018 before rising to 4 percent and higher after that.By 2039, the federal debt is expected to reach more than 100 percent of G.D.P., under current law, from about 74 percent today.Budget office officials acknowledge that any long-term forecast of government spending is tricky because of changes in the economy or federal law that cannot be anticipated.For example, health care spending growth was in line with G.D.P. during the 1990s economic boom, when there were budget surpluses. But forecasters at the time could not have predicted the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, or the depth of the most recent recession, both of which changed the course of politics and the economy.Advertisement"}

It is near the town of Newton Stewart, about an hour from Dumfries and two hours from Glasgow.A RENOVATED VICTORIAN ESTATE IN SOUTHWEST SCOTLAND$4.46 MILLION (2,620,000 POUNDS)Cradled at the foot of the rugged Galloway Hills of southwest Scotland, this estate includes a 13-bedroom, 25,000-square-foot country home, five estate houses and cottages, a garden, stables, equestrian facilities and outbuildings, all on about 100 acres of forested land. With almost a mile of frontage on the River Cree, the estate could be sold as five lots, but the owners, who bought it in 2000 and oversaw a five-year renovation, said they would do so only after attempting to sell it in its entirety. \u201cWhat\u2019s magical about this property is it\u2019s truly a kingdom,\u201d said Raymond Butler, who owns the estate, historically called Penninghame House, with his wife, Marie. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in it, with the river and the beautiful trees and the garden, you don\u2019t know that the outside world exists.\u201dA small portion of the principal three-story mansion, including several rooms used as offices and a dining room, was constructed around 1700, Mr. Butler said. But the more lavish part of the gray-stone structure, which has battlements and was designed by the prolific Scottish architects Brown & Wardrop, was constructed in 1869, when the estate was near the height of its grandeur, with 37,000 acres, 40 farms and three parishes, he said. Originally built as the private home of a tea baron, Penninghame was also used as a hospital during World War I and was operating as a prison when the Butlers acquired it in 2000. The house is currently being used as a retreat for groups. The Butlers\u2019 renovation included the restoration of historic details and the addition of contemporary amenities, such as central heating. In addition to 13 bedrooms, the mansion has eight full bathrooms and numerous powder rooms, five reception rooms, four kitchens, two large dining rooms, offices, a gymnasium, sauna and steam room and changing rooms. One wing can be used as a self-contained two-bedroom apartment. There are five ornate wood-burning fireplaces, including two that are \u201cmuseum pieces with fabulous details,\u201d Mr. Butler said.\u201cThey\u2019re classic pieces that we think date to earlier than the house, but came in as secondhand pieces when the house was built,\u201d he said.Ceilings on the ground floor are at least 12 feet high and decorated with the original plasterwork. Most of the floors are original, of pitch pine and redwood imported from North America, while a grand staircase is carved oak, as is elaborate carved trim for eight-foot doors and wall paneling, Mr. Butler said. The rooms are large, but not quite as cavernous and drafty as those often found in Scottish mansions, he said.Penninghame\u2019s grounds have a walled garden used to grow organic produce, along with greenhouses and mature trees, such as beech, oak and Wellingtonia. The five estate houses and cottages were built in different eras, and all are renovated and maintained, with multiple bedrooms, kitchens and bathrooms. There are two stable blocks, one renovated as a cooking school, as well as equestrian facilities, a riding arena and numerous other outbuildings. Approval has been obtained to add a pool, along with a pool house and boat house, Mr. Butler said.MARKET OVERVIEWScotland\u2019s independence referendum in September has been looming over the property market there for the last 18 months, said Ran Morgan, the head of Scotland residential for the brokerage Knight Frank, which has this listing. Uncertainty about the outcome may have dampened the budding recovery of Scotland\u2019s property market, brokers said.\u201cGenerally, Scotland\u2019s economy, along with the rest of the U.K., is improving, and there\u2019s more money and more confidence, but people actually are waiting to see the outcome of this referendum before putting their hands in their pockets,\u201d Mr. Morgan said.Still, there are signs that the residential market has bottomed out since the global recession of 2008, and the market has stabilized, with home prices possibly even increasing 3 to 4 percent this year, said Andrew Perratt, the head of residential for Scotland and northern England at the brokerage Savills. \u201cPrices are still about 25 percent off their peak in 2007 and 2008, but we\u2019re starting to see a recovery in our three prime hubs of the market \u2014 Edinburgh\u2019s New Town, Glasgow\u2019s West End and prime central Aberdeen,\u201d he said. A two-bedroom apartment would typically sell for 300,000 to 400,000 pounds, or $510,000 to $680,000 in all three places. Because the price gap between homes in London and Scotland has grown such that a London home may be priced four to 10 times higher than a comparable home in Scotland, \u201csupercommuters\u201d have arrived in the Scottish home market, and that group of buyers is expected to grow, Mr. Perratt said.\u201cWe\u2019ve started to see them in the last couple of years, these people who come out of London and take advantage of the low property prices of Scotland, and they \u2018supercommute\u2019 back to London maybe three or four days a week,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can fly down to London in an hour.\u201dWhile Scotland\u2019s market for large country houses, typically bought by Londoners seeking quality of life, continues to languish since the global recession, the market for grand estates that typically cost from 3 million to 25 million pounds, or around $5 million to $43 million, has thrived, Mr. Perratt said.\u201cWe know from research that the world\u2019s superwealthy like to buy sporting estates in Scotland,\u201d he said. Middle Eastern and Russian buyers are interested in acquiring \u201ctrophy sporting estates.\u201d he said. WHO BUYS IN SCOTLANDThough the number of Londoners seeking weekend and retirement homes in Scotland has shrunk in recent years, foreign buyers from around the world continue to purchase homes in Scotland, brokers said. They are typically from northern Europe and Scandinavia, the United States and the Middle East, Mr. Morgan said.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign home buyers in Scotland. Estate agents are available to assist buyers, and typically charge a commission of 1.5 to 2 percent, Mr. Morgan said.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you if you want someone to act on your behalf or not, but if you\u2019re a foreigner, I would suggest it,\u201d he said.Lawyers handle the paperwork, typically charging a few hundred pounds for a straightforward deal, while estate agents representing the seller commonly charge about 2 percent commission, Mr. Morgan said.Buyers must pay stamp duty, which ranges from 1 to 7 percent depending on the home price \u2014 buyers purchasing homes over 2 million pounds are charged 7 percent \u2014 but those figures could change with Scotland\u2019s referendum in September, Mr. Perratt said.\u201cIf there is a \u2018yes\u2019 vote, we\u2019ll need a lot of questions answered, and markets don\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the two to three years of negotiation between the Scottish government and the British government to extricate themselves from the union, the whole property market could potentially freeze.\u201dWEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, Gaelic, Scots; pound sterling (1 pound = $1.70)TAXES AND FEESCouncil taxes on the entire estate are roughly 8,000 pounds, or $13,600, a year.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

What concerns us here is that no one seems to have thought through the economic implications of what these fatuous shows represent, specifically the inexorable march toward television that is all nude, all the time.\u201cDating Naked\u201d won\u2019t seem all that scandalous to inhabitants of the texting generation, for whom sharing photos of their naughty bits is now routine. The series is just a continuation of a tawdry show-it-all TV trend that began a year or so ago when reality series involving nude castaways (\u201cNaked and Afraid\u201d), nude real estate transactions (\u201cBuying Naked\u201d) and nude body painting (\u201cNaked Vegas\u201d) began turning up. That is going to cost the jobs of countless costume designers, seamstresses, ironers, dry cleaners. Several Emmy Award categories will disappear, though in fairness, one will surely be added for outstanding blurring of crotches and nipples.

{"Headline": "Brazil's Unaffordable Homes", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 I live in Mandaqui, a district six miles from downtown. The nearest subway station is roughly two miles away, or about 30 minutes by bus, since they\u2019re slow and scarce. It\u2019s not the best place to live if you don\u2019t have a car. Even so, the average price per square foot here recently soared to $250. Real estate in prime areas of the city can now cost as much as $465 per square foot.In the last six years, housing prices in S\u00e3o Paulo have increased by 208 percent, and the cost of rent has increased 97.5 percent in the metro area. According to the website Numbeo, which compiles user-generated data, a 970-square-foot apartment here costs the equivalent of 16 years of an average family\u2019s total income. By comparison, this cost-to-income ratio is eight in New York, 6.9 in Berlin and only three in Chicago. Someone making the minimum wage in Brazil ($325 a month) can afford to rent only a three-room shack in the crime-ridden Favela Parais\u00f3polis ($280), leaving him practically nothing left over to live on. Brazil is experiencing a severe housing shortage. According to the Inter-American Development Bank, one in three families lives in inadequate housing. The country has an estimated shortage of 5.8 million units, of which 90 percent is concentrated on lower-income families. According to research by the Jo\u00e3o Pinheiro Foundation, 442,710 households in S\u00e3o Paulo spend 30 percent or more of their income on rent. These families are in danger of joining 44,699 other households living in precarious conditions and 83,011 in which more than three family members are squeezed into the same bedroom \u2014 an overcrowding solution to a dead-end situation. More and more, the poor are pushed away from the city and forced to live in the far suburbs. And more and more, those suburbs also expel them. In Cap\u00e3o Redondo, 14 miles from downtown, the average housing price increased 312 percent in the last five years. It\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re the country of favelas, urban slums built by desperate people using poor materials such as cardboard and tin. They pop up in areas without basic infrastructure or sanitation, and are sometimes vulnerable to landslides, floods and fires.In early 2009, the government took note and began a program called Minha Casa, Minha Vida (My House, My Life). The public-private partnership aimed to reduce this deficit by facilitating credit and financing construction. But from the beginning, it favored families that earned three times the minimum wage or more. As of 2012, after the first and second stages of the program, only 40 to 45 percent of all contracts were assigned to the poorest families. The program appeared to be more about improving the economy than helping the poor. Many critics also complained about the quality of the 344-square-foot houses destined for the poorest, which were built in remote areas without adequate infrastructure.Although the government has promised to correct those deficiencies in the third stage of the program, any reforms will most likely be hobbled by the influence of the housing industry. According to the investigative news website Publica, from 2002 to 2012 Brazil\u2019s four biggest construction companies donated $215 million to the political campaigns of all major parties. In the last municipal elections in S\u00e3o Paulo, construction and real estate companies were responsible for 57 percent of donations. These companies have deep interests in sustaining the old urbanization model marked by segregation and inequality. One of the strongest groups fighting these issues is Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem-Teto \u2014 the Homeless Workers Movement \u2014 which combines negotiation with the government and direct confrontation on housing issues. The group has 50,000 families enrolled as members nationwide and 20,000 in S\u00e3o Paulo, where, on a rainy Thursday just before the World Cup, it led 15,000 people in a protest against evictions and overspending on the event. The organization also advocates the occupation of abandoned buildings or areas that are kept vacant by real estate companies (some of them bankrupt); the resistance of forced evictions; and the government expropriation of housing for, as written in our Constitution, \u201cpublic necessity.\u201d Its leaders also quote our Constitution when saying that \u201cproperty shall observe its social function,\u201d and that the economic order is \u201cintended to ensure everyone a life with dignity, in accordance with the dictates of social justice.\u201d For many years, the Homeless Workers Movement has endured fierce opposition from the public and the news media. But in the last few months, it has amassed some important victories. A month before the World Cup, more than 2,000 families squatted in an area that had been abandoned for years, near the Itaquera stadium, one of nine occupations in S\u00e3o Paulo. (The biggest of them, Nova Palestina, has had roughly 8,000 families camped out since November.) In a matter of weeks, the protesters near Itaquera got the government to agree to build low-income housing on the site as an extension of the My House, My Life program. The movement has also effected some changes in the program itself: It has persuaded the government to assign a greater share of the contracts to nonprofit organizations instead of private contractors, which could mean more autonomy and better houses in better neighborhoods. It has also stepped into the debate around the recently approved S\u00e3o Paulo City Plan, which will increase the regulation of land speculation and duplicate the number of Special Zones of Social Interest \u2014 areas devoted to low-income housing \u2014 in the city. The group claims that adequate housing is a human right and shouldn\u2019t be ruled by market logic alone. That argument is convincing, especially when you look at the numbers: There are more than six million vacant housing units in Brazil \u2014 more than enough to cover our shortage. Advertisement"}

The unpaid bills have starved companies of cash and triggered layoffs, factory closures and bankruptcies. \u201cWe will ensure that the arrears are paid off by the end of the year,\u201d Mr. Padoan said, according to Corriere della Sera.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi promised in March to pay back all the debt in arrears by July. Within a week he pushed back the target date to September.The government is finding it hard to tackle the problem because of public finance constraints, inefficiency, uncertainty over exactly how much is owed and a reluctance on the part of some public bodies to acknowledge their debts.In June, the European Commission opened a formal infringement procedure against Italy because of its failure to comply with the Late Payments Directive, which orders governments to reduce payment delays to no more than 60 days.Mr. Padoan also confirmed reports that Italy might delay the privatization of 40 percent of Poste Italiane, which was planned by the end of this year.But he said the government was considering accelerating the sale of stakes in energy companies Eni and Enel in order to keep the revenues from its privatization plans on track. In other remarks, Mr. Padoan ruled out that Italy would have to adopt additional budget correction measures for this year, even though most projections for economic growth are well below the government's official 0.8 percent forecast.Italy\u2019s budget deficit will come in below the European Union\u2019s ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product, Mr. Padoan said.Advertisement"}

You\u2019re going to meditate every day, whether you like it or not.\u201dAs it happens, Mr. Dratch and the dozen other Adamahniks tramping through the dew on a recent weekday morning were also bushwhacking a trail in modern Jewish life. In its 11 years of existence, Adamah has produced no more than 300 graduates. But its alumni \u2014 former goat wranglers and kraut stirrers \u2014 are inventing some of the most influential institutions in Jewish food, farming and sustainability.These \u201cimmersive experiences\u201d engage Jewish 20-somethings in their natural realm, said Sarah Chandler, Adamah\u2019s director of earth-based spiritual practice. (Of her title, she said, \u201cif it sounds like I made it up, it\u2019s because I did make it up.\u201d)She added: \u201cJewish life is totally different now.

And yet Ms. Chandler, 35, conceded, \u201cThis program is filling a role in the eyes of young Jews, in their imagination, that used to be filled by going to Israel for a few months and spending time at a kibbutz.\u201dA number of the Adamahniks have done that, too. Alex Lyon, 21, lived on a commercial \u201ceco-farm\u201d called Kibbutz Ketura. The daily experience \u2014 say, tree-trimming from a tractor, 30 feet above the ground \u2014 taught him a useful lesson: \u201cPrune the dates as fast as possible.\u201dBy comparison, Mr. Sadeh said, \u201cI\u2019m really clear that we\u2019re not trying to produce farmers.\u201d Yet the fellows are unmistakably seeking something: \u201cMost of them acknowledge that they\u2019ve been in their heads too long.\u201dMr. Sadeh continued: \u201cOne of our former field managers called it the Jewish blue-collar training program. We take upper-middle-class, college-educated kids and show them some blue-collar skills.\u201dAt 7 a.m., a blue-collar, immersive Jewish experience was about to occur in the garbage enclosure behind the dining hall. As part of morning chores, Maddy Herzog, 22, and Andrew Rosen, 20, would be loading trash cans onto a caddy and wheeling it down the road to what a sign calls Bubbe\u2019s Breakdown Bistro, a series of raw compost mounds in the chicken yard.Even an eco-conscious retreat center generates a lot of trash. Isabella Freedman started in 1897 as the Jewish Working Girls Vacation Society: a cheap rural getaway for laborers in the urban garment trades. It\u2019s an irony of the postindustrial economy that Jewish girls (and boys) from the city \u2014 the Adamahniks \u2014 now pay $1,000 to $1,500 to labor here in the country for three or four months.The labels, designed by Mr. Sadeh\u2019s wife, Jaimie, advertise the ecological mission of Adamah and the health benefits of live lacto-fermentation. There\u2019s a reason Mr. Sadeh calls the commercial kitchen the Center for Cultural Proliferation.Now that the sun was up, something smelled as if it was lacto-fermenting in the compost bins. Maybe last night\u2019s meatloaf. Typically this hauling job would take two round trips. But Mr. Rosen had resolved that all five cans, each weighing 50 or 60 pounds, could be squeezed on the rickety \u201cpeasant cart.\u201d\u201cAndrew, you\u2019re going to spill all this,\u201d Ms. Herzog said.Mr. Rosen said, \u201cAnd I take responsibility for this.\u201dMs. Herzog said, \u201cWe\u2019re going \u2014 \u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to be having breakfast early,\u201d Mr. Rosen interrupted. A junior at Queens College, he will be returning from Adamah to a yeshiva in Far Rockaway, N.Y.\u201cI didn\u2019t come here for the Jewish education,\u201d he said. \u201cI came to learn about perennials, which are all here, and permaculture and pickling and cheese-making and invasive plants.\u201dMs. Herzog, who last year received a journalism degree from Northwestern University, said, \u201cSo far, this is new.\u201d By that, she meant everything. The meditation and the gratitude she liked. During the hike, she had tucked a black-eyed Susan behind her right ear.\u201cThis morning I was able to wake up and not hate my life so much,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first week or so, I thought, \u2018What have I gotten myself into?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2022Beit Adamah, the Adamah House, lies a half-mile down the road, a distance traversed by a fleet of bicycles that appear to date back to the age of the Second Temple. B.A., as it\u2019s known, is a three-bedroom split-level whose living space is either comfy or grotty, depending on your disposition and how recently you\u2019ve lived in college housing.You could call the decorating style \u201clandfill revival,\u201d with the last-stop couches, and the ants, and the home-brew experiments on the kitchen floor. Alternately, you could choose to live in a tent.The tidiest room in B.A. is the worship annex in the back, where the fellows do their avodat lev (\u201cheart work\u201d) in the morning and celebrate the Sabbath. The liturgy here changes, depending on who\u2019s leading it. By design, Adamah is \u201cpluralistic\u201d or \u201cpost-denominational\u201d or \u201call-stream.\u201d The fellows may have grown up attending services that are Jewish Renewal, Reform, Conservative, modern Orthodox or Hasidic \u2014 or attending no services at all. Yet they seem to agree on a few points of the Sabbath ritual. There will be bare feet (and only bare feet), a lot of ecstatic chanting in Hebrew and a bountiful distribution of beer.The diversity of religious practices is perhaps exceeded only by the variety of kosher diets: omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, honey-tolerant vegan, etc. Today\u2019s breakfast was a fresh egg scramble and homemade granola with raw goat milk.It\u2019s not what Shira Frager, 26, buys for herself back home in Queens. This morning, she poured herself a mug of coffee and examined the raw goat milk. She lifted it to her nose and took a whiff. And then she made a leap of faith.\u2022The farm used to be bigger. For seven years, the fellows sowed four fertile acres along a bend in the Hollenbeck River.Then Hurricane Irene paid a call and the river washed it all away. You could say that the destructive waters are biblical. Or you could say the environment appears to be changing, and not for the better. Mr. Sadeh favors the latter interpretation.The Talmud, Judaism\u2019s collection of rules and interpretation, overflows with regulations that define the practices of an ancient agrarian society. But these laws are binding only in the land of Israel.\u201cThat\u2019s not the way I think about life, or Judaism, or tradition,\u201d Mr. Sadeh said. \u201cFor me, it cheapens the whole thing. We\u2019re not a biblical theme park.\u201dThe practice of \u201cshmita,\u201d a resting of the fields and forgiveness of debts, is a good case study. The letter of the Talmud declares that every seven years, the land should lie fallow. No planting, no pruning. The gates of the farm must be thrown open to all comers.Mr. Sadeh appreciates the revolutionary implications: \u201cIt\u2019s a limitation of the excesses of capitalism, of private ownership.\u201dYet when the shmita year starts this September, \u201cIf we don\u2019t farm, it just means the dining hall and our C.S.A. members get vegetables from a less ecologically satisfactory location.\u201d Does the Talmud intend for Jewish consumers to shop at Whole Foods?Mr. Sadeh has settled on the idea of performing ecological restoration. The hills above Isabella Freedman are blighted with invasive plants: garlic mustard, multiflora rose, Asian bittersweet.Adamah exists to teach \u201cthe way agriculture has imbued Jewish ritual life, the communal life, with meaning,\u201d Mr. Sadeh said. \u201cWe don\u2019t work on Shabbat. Otherwise, if you walk on the farm, you wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s a Jewish farm.\u201dOr put it this way: When Ms. Frager asked how the sheep and the goats get along in the pasture, Mr. Sadeh could offer an answer from scripture. The biblical term \u201ctzon\u201d meant a mixed flock. The sheep ate the grass; the goats ate the brush. But it was more important that Ms. Frager recognize the live wire on the electric fence.\u2022At a certain hour in the day, a young Jewish farmer has learned all she\u2019s going to learn from pounding 350 pounds of freshly picked cabbage in a food-grade drum. This is when the lessons move to the classroom \u2014 or, rather, the instructional yurt.On a recent evening after dinner, the topic was dust. The starting point was a passage from Genesis: \u201cThen the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.\u201dThe 12th-century rabbi and scholar Rashi posited that the dust of creation came from the four corners of the Earth. Did this mean that we are by nature worldly and interconnected? \u201cThere\u2019s no one answer,\u201d Mr. Sadeh said. And he dispatched the Adamahniks to study essays by Barry Lopez and Rebecca Solnit on the topics of economic migration and rootedness. In sum, where do we call home?For several of the fellows, the answer was right here, in this yurt, in the holy city of Falls Village. Meredith Cohen, 31, came to Adamah after working eight years in education (starting with Teach for America, in New Orleans). \u201cWhen I discovered Adamah, I thought, \u2018Everything I want in life, that I thought I had to work and build, already is in this place,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.So when her fellowship period ended last fall, Ms. Cohen said, \u201cI never left.\u201d Now, she manages the dairy-goat barn as one of four apprentices.The problem with marching in the advance guard of Jewish thought is that the rest of the army can seem pretty far behind. Rory Katz, who starts rabbinical school this fall at the Jewish Theological Seminary, in Morningside Heights, recalled what happened when her parents\u2019 synagogue booked a speaker from the Jewish environmental group Hazon, Adamah\u2019s national parent organization.\u201cThey spent a whole weekend around the topic of food activism,\u201d Ms. Katz, 26, said. \u201cThey did a lot of advertising trying to get people to come. And then my mom said it was boring. My dad said it was boring, even though he had helped organize it.\u201dAs an intentional eco-community, Adamah would seem to represent a mock-up of the Promised Land. Yet at some point the shared meals and the back-rub circles can begin to feel more real than the real world.On the Fourth of July, Emily Sellman, 23, went home to her family in Baltimore for a weekend on the beach. \u201cI didn\u2019t like leaving,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a little bit of a culture shock. No, it was a culture shock.\u201dWhat was wrong?\u201cThe food was funny,\u201d Ms. Sellman said. \u201cYou have to dress up. You have to look good.\u201dThe discomfort, she ultimately concluded, wasn\u2019t so much cosmetic as existential. \u201cI almost felt useless,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m used to doing work, and all the stimulation and learning here. With my family, I was just at the beach. It was too much downtime.\u201dBack at Adamah, heart work starts tomorrow at 6 o\u2019clock, sharp.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Home Prices Rose at Slower Pace in May", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Home prices in the United States rose in May from a year earlier at the weakest pace in 15 months, as sales remained modest in the spring buying season.The Standard & Poor\u2019s/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, released Tuesday, increased 9.3 percent in May from 12 months earlier. That is down from 10.8 percent in the previous month and the smallest annual gain since February 2013.Also Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that consumers were more confident about the economy than they had been in nearly seven years. Its confidence index rose to 90.9 in July, from an upwardly revised 86.4 in June. The July reading is the highest since October 2007, two months before the recession officially began.In home prices, early price gains slowed in 18 of the 20 cities. They accelerated in Charlotte, N.C., and were flat in Tampa, Fla.After steady gains early last year, home sales have been restrained by weak wage increases and tight credit, particularly for first-time buyers. Mortgage rates also rose last summer, slowing sales.The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of American homes. The index measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The May figures are the latest available.Cities in the West and South showed some of the biggest increases. Prices rose 16.9 percent in Las Vegas from a year earlier, the largest gain, followed by a 15.4 percent increase in San Francisco and 13.2 percent in Miami.Other housing data have painted a mixed picture of the real estate market. While sales of existing homes have picked up, new-home sales plummeted in June. And new home construction has fallen for two straight months. That could lead to fewer construction jobs.Still, home prices have risen steadily since housing began to recover in 2012. The Case-Shiller index has risen 27.3 percent after bottoming out in March 2012. But home prices remain about 17 percent below the peaks reached in the summer of 2006, just before the housing crisis hit.The Conference Board reported its third straight increase in the consumer confidence index. Economists said strong job growth has helped bolster consumers\u2019 assessment of current conditions and also improved their outlook on jobs and the economy.Lynn Franco, a Conference Board economist, says the improvements in consumers\u2019 confidence and expectations about the future indicate that the recent strengthening in overall economic growth should continue in the second half of the year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Aims to Make Forlorn City a Model for Revival", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeople come to wash in the Ganges River and pray at sunrise in the city of Varanasi. Municipal waste and untreated sewage is the largest source of pollution of Ganges near the Ghats of Varanasi. The budget proposed by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has fueled hope, a commodity in short supply here. Mr. Modi allocated 20.4 billion rupee to clean up the Ganges, which is expected to help Varanasi.VARANASI, India \u2014 The big question on many minds here is: How long will the electricity last?Since Narendra Modi was elected prime minister in May, residents in this forlorn city on the Ganges \u2014 at least those with wiring \u2014 have had near constant electricity, compared with the failures totaling as much as eight to 10 hours a day in the past.In the last month, Ahsan Khan, a carpet exporter and owner of a local car dealership, said he had relied less on his backup generators. \u201cThat\u2019s a big cost savings for me personally and for anyone doing business here,\u201d he said.Mr. Modi has promised to tackle Varanasi\u2019s legion of problems and turn this holiest \u2014 and one of the dirtiest \u2014 of Hindu cities into a showcase of Indian culture and small business undergirded by better infrastructure. Along with improving the electricity supply, he has pledged new roads to alleviate congestion, suburban areas to reduce crowding for the one million-plus residents and support for the weaving and tourism businesses that are pillars of this city\u2019s economy.Many are looking at Varanasi as a case study for what the prime minister hopes to achieve across vast swathes of India that never boomed the way Mumbai and Bangalore did and are now suffering even more as the country\u2019s economy has slowed.But the challenges are big, even in just one city. Varanasi\u2019s roads are pocked with potholes and washed-out patches. Piles of construction rubble studded with garbage are feasting grounds for pigs and dogs. In many places, raw sewage flows in shallow ditches that flood in monsoon season, spreading their contents into streets. The showcase ghats \u2014 the line of more than 80 stone stairways leading down to the Ganges \u2014 are dirty and thronged with hawkers, holy men and con artists.Businessmen are fond of joking that the last major infrastructure project here took place in the 1970s, when a railway station and motor works were built.\u201cThere is a hopelessness that has steeped into people here, but that is changing with the election of the prime minister,\u201d said Raj Kumar Agrawal, an aide to Varanasi\u2019s mayor, Ramgopal Mohley. \u201cPeople are excited for the first time in a long time.\u201dEarly signs of Mr. Modi\u2019s commitment to Varanasi are largely cosmetic, like more consistent electricity and cleaner railway stations. Last week, the Railway Ministry pledged roughly 2 billion rupees, or about $33 million, to overhaul Varanasi\u2019s main station.Speculators betting on a Modi-backed renaissance have also pushed land prices up, particularly in the area around the airport. Mr. Khan said he had secured a deal to buy some land about 12 kilometers outside the city for 550,000 rupees, or roughly $9,200, before Mr. Modi was elected prime minister. But he was ultimately outbid.\u201cI then went to Delhi, and by the time I got back, after he had been elected, the owners told me they had an offer for 6.2 lakh\u201d \u2014 a lakh equals 100,000 rupees, or around $1,700 \u2014 \u201cand they sold it for 7 lakh,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cThough not to me.\u201dPerhaps even more important, though, was the news that Mr. Modi will open a branch of his office here.\u201cThese are important announcements for the city of Varanasi,\u201d said Ashok Kapoor, a carpet exporter who did not vote for Mr. Modi, although his wife did. \u201cOnce a local office of Modi is established here, all these projects will see the light of day.\u201dMr. Kapoor said that the office would give the prime minister a direct line to his constituency here, and allow his deputies to relay feedback and ensure that promises are kept.All of these plans are aimed at restoring Varanasi\u2019s pre-eminence as a destination for religious pilgrims and tourists seeking a glimpse of its turn-of-the-century glory, when the Rev. Charles Phillips Cape described it as \u201cthe Oxford and Mecca of Hinduism.\u201dThe city has four universities, including one of the largest residential colleges in Asia, Banaras Hindu University, and one of the few remaining Sanskrit universities. Varanasi\u2019s religious significance for Hindus and Buddhists is high. Anyone who dies here, according to Hindu belief, escapes the cycle of reincarnation. The site where Buddha is thought to have given the first philosophy lesson is also nearby.\u201cIf I want to take my customers to a nice restaurant, I can\u2019t take them anywhere near the river,\u201d said Ashok Gupta, owner of Banaras Beads, which makes beads and costume jewelry. \u201cIt is impossible to get there and too dirty.\u201dHis priorities for the city are cleanliness and better infrastructure for water and sanitation. He would love to see elegant hotels go up along the Ganges, replacing the cheap hotels frequented by backpackers that occupy that prized real estate.Also on his wish list are road improvements. The city has only three trunk roads, and delivery trucks are prohibited from entering Varanasi during the day.\u201cThis means I have to pay more to get raw materials, like the glass rods we use to make beads,\u201d Mr. Gupta said.The prime minister favors a ring road that would allow delivery trucks and other vehicles to avoid the city center and more directly reach their destinations. \u201cA ring road is a must,\u201d said Mr. Mohley, the mayor.Mr. Mohley, who was invited to New Delhi to meet with Mr. Modi and his team shortly after the election, has stepped up his efforts to expedite improvement projects. Local newspapers have delighted in the mayor\u2019s treks around town to identify buildings and temporary structures that encroach on the already narrow roads.\u201cI feel like something can happen now, unlike before,\u201d the mayor said.The city already had declared some roads one-way, though enforcement is lax and ineffectual when it comes to the many cows that roam this city. Mr. Mohley dreams of multilevel parking garages and pedestrian-only zones.He has also accelerated the installation of sewage pipes aimed at replacing the shallow open ditches that serve as the sewers in many parts of town. At the moment, however, there is no treatment facility to connect the pipes. The city can treat only about a third of the 350 million liters of sewage it produces each day, Mr. Mohley said.A project to build a new waste-treatment plant that was financed more than a decade ago remains stalled, as the state government has yet to find a site. It is a reminder, Mr. Mohley said, that the central government can make all the promises it wants but if the state government refuses to carry them out, nothing will happen.Still, the prime minister has made cleaning the Ganges a priority, which cannot happen without addressing Varanasi\u2019s sewage problems. Sudhir Krishna, a confidant of Mr. Modi\u2019s, recently inspected Varanasi\u2019s current sewage treatment facilities and solid waste treatment plant.Other plans include the development of so-called satellite cities, essentially suburbs, like those around New Delhi, to reduce traffic in the central city. Institutions are planned to develop traditional weaving and to train hospitality workers.The prime minister has said he wants to see Varanasi become a Unesco World Heritage city. To that end, he already has committed 180 million rupee, or a little more than $3 million, to cleaning and shoring up the ghats and building jetties for better organization of the boats that ferry tourists on the river.Mr. Upadhyay is a jaded millennial, but he, too, is infected by Modi hope. \u201cI want to believe in him,\u201d he said.An article on Friday about efforts by India\u2019s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, to modernize the poor city of Varanasi as a case study for his policies misspelled the surname of an aide to Varanasi\u2019s mayor. He is Raj Kumar Agrawal, not Agarwal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daimler Demonstrates a Self-Driving Truck", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMAGDEBURG, Germany \u2014 For Daimler, the truck driver of the future looks something like this: He is seated in the cab of a semi, eyes on a tablet and hands resting in his lap.Daimler demonstrated its vision Thursday along a stretch of the A14 autobahn near Magdeburg in eastern Germany, the culmination of years of innovation. It says the vehicle \u2014 called the Mercedes-Benz Future Truck 2025, a nod to the year the carmaker hopes it will be introduced \u2014 is capable of responding to traffic while driving completely autonomously down a freeway at speeds of up to 85 kilometers per hour, or 52 miles per hour.\u201cThe Future Truck 2025 leads to more efficiency, and better safety and connectivity,\u201d said Wolfgang Bernhard, the head of Daimler Trucks. \u201cThis in turn results in a more sustainable transport system to the benefit of the economy, society and consumers.\u201dOnly one prototype of Future Truck 2025 exists, and the company declined to reveal for how much the vehicle would sell. Regulatory and legal challenges also remain before the truck would be allowed to take to the road.No figures are available for commercial vehicles, but analysts with IHS Automotive predicted in a research note that adding self-driving technology to personal cars, which more manufacturers are exploring, would increase the cost of vehicles by about $10,000 by 2020.Along an eight-lane stretch of the autobahn, the large silver truck of the future fell into line with 20 other vehicles used to simulate realistic driving conditions. The truck responded to slowing cars in its lane by adjusting its speed accordingly and registered an approaching emergency vehicle in time to slide effortlessly into the far-right lane, allowing the emergency vehicle to pass on the left.Volvo, the Swedish manufacturer, has been developing driverless vehicles as part of the European Union\u2019s Safe Road Trains for the Environment program, which envisions creating a caravan of vehicles that follow a leader in an effort to reduce wind-drag and fuel costs. Only the vehicles following the leader, which is in the hands of a driver, are able to function autonomously.But the experience of guiding a self-driving truck is far less stressful than the vigilance required from a human to respond to traffic conditions. This means that drivers could have enough free time to speak with their families or employers, take care of paperwork or make travel plans like booking a slot at a rest stop or making arrangements for future load.\u201cIt\u2019s strange at first,\u201d said Hans Luft, who sat in the truck\u2019s cab during the demonstration on Thursday. He waved his hands to show observers that he did not need them on the wheel, tapping at his tablet while taking advantage of the 45-degree swivel of his driver\u2019s seat. \u201cBut you quickly learn to trust it and then it\u2019s great.\u201dThe driver still needs to start the vehicle and enter the flow of traffic. But once the Future Truck reaches 80 k.p.h., or 50 m.p.h., a prompt in the system asks the driver to activate what is called the Highway Pilot, which effectively takes over.Equipped with sensors in the front that have ranges of 70 to 250 meters, or 77 to 273 yards, and cameras capable of capturing images in more than one direction, the Future Truck can identify single- and double-lane roads, pedestrians and objects \u2014 moving or stationary \u2014 and respond to them.Analysts say there remain hurdles for self-driving vehicles, like liability and cyber security issues, along with data quality and privacy.\u201cThe deployment of autonomous vehicles today is less about technological capabilities and more about the ability of stakeholders to handle the various commercial and governance complexities associated with having such vehicles on the road,\u201d said Ernst and Young in a research note.At this point, the technology requires clear and consistent road markings that can be easily detected by the sensors. And laws in Europe requiring drivers to keep their eyes on the road would have to be changed. Regulations governing international truck travel and the use of data collected by the truck\u2019s systems have to be adapted.Manufacturers will also have to ensure that their vehicles will be able to communicate with infrastructure and other vehicles across borders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Everything Boom Might End: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", "Date": "2014-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestor OutlookThe answers fit into three broad categories: the good, the bad and the ugly. Here is what each possible outcome looks like.The goodThe most hopeful outcome for the global economy \u2014 and global asset prices \u2014 is that the low price of capital will help unleash productive new investments that create higher growth in the future \u2014 and that the economy will in effect grow into the current market valuations.Companies could use their ability to borrow money cheaply or issue new stock on favorable terms to finance new inventions, new factories, new workers. Governments could use their ability to borrow cheaply to invest in infrastructure and education, increasing the longer-term productive capacity of the global economy. High prices for real estate in some of the most economically productive cities on earth could lead developers to put up more buildings there.If this future materializes, interest rates would presumably rise, meaning people who bought bonds at their current ultra-low interest rates could lose money. But that would probably happen gradually, and in the context of strong returns to stocks and other risky assets. After all, in this more prosperous future, corporate earnings would rise along with the economy.In effect, this result would be one in which central banks\u2019 efforts to stimulate growth through cheap money policies (finally) have their desired effect, and once strong global growth arrives, everything else takes care of itself.The badPeople tend to assume that the current world of very low interest rates must be a short-term aberration. It\u2019s not necessarily so. Just ask the Japanese; 10-year government borrowing rates have been below 2 percent almost continuously for the last 15 years (they edged above that level one day in May 2006).There are different names and explanations for it \u2014 a liquidity trap, a secular stagnation \u2014 and one of the great macroeconomic debates of our age is why this might be happening and what policy makers could or should do about it. But whatever you want to call it and whatever you believe its origins to be, the effects on the economy and markets are clear. It means continued low to nonexistent growth, low interest rates and low inflation. And the Japanese experience shows that it can persist for quite a long time.In other words, it could be that the era of low interest rates and low returns on investments doesn\u2019t end with an economic boom or with a collapse. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to end at all. It may be that the world needs to buckle in for the kind of slow-growth, low-interest-rate world of the last few years for a long time to come.The uglyThe two outcomes above appear the most likely. But we are in uncharted territory in many ways, and it is possible that the world may not work the way standard Keynesian economic models suggest it will.In those models, for example, inflation can become a problem only when the economy is overheating. But what if the unconventional tools that central banks have used over the last half a decade have different results, causing, for example, a spike in prices even as the economy remains depressed? Then you could see bonds fall in value, but unlike in the \u201cgood\u201d scenario above, not be accompanied by a rising economic tide.Or, perhaps the large deficits that the United States and other countries have run during the crisis years will one day cause a crisis of confidence in advanced nations\u2019 debt. Interest rates could spike (and bonds could fall sharply in value, and probably other investments, too) not because the economy is recovering, but because of that loss of market confidence.Or maybe some external force will result in an economic downturn, which world economic policy makers would have few tools to fight after exhausting most of them over the last few years. If that happened, what would in normal times cause a mild downturn might instead bring about something more dangerous, like a new depression and market collapse.Which of these is most likely? For the last few years, many official projections \u2014 forecasts from government agencies and bank economic research shops, for example \u2014 have tended toward the \u201cgood\u201d outcome, predicting a full-throated expansion as being just around the corner. Many commentators, particularly on cable financial television, have predicted an \u201cugly\u201d one, full of out-of-control inflation, debt crises and collapse.But the pattern of the last few years shows that the \u201cbad\u201d scenario has been closest to the reality. That doesn\u2019t mean the rest of the bad script will continue in the years ahead, but it should prompt those predicting the first or third outcome to wrestle with why they have been wrong so far.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Owners and Brokers, Web Rentals Upend the Hamptons Season", "Date": "2014-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe AppraisalEAST HAMPTON, N.Y. \u2014 The photos could hardly do the place justice, and not just because they were pixelated. No picture could have captured those strands of silver and gold shooting through the clouds as the sun set over Lake Montauk, the sloops and fishing boats bobbing alongside the once-rare-now-everywhere yachts.It was paradise, for only $224 a night. And it was against the law.The East End of Long Island has long been one of the most sought-after summertime escapes, one generally out of reach for the average vacationer as fishing villages and farms have become playgrounds for the rich. But the democratizing power of the Internet has turned more Hamptonites into prospering landlords, given visitors many more options and brokers many fewer, and left local officials busy trying to keep a cork on all the new activity.\u201cIf you\u2019re staying for a month or two, you probably want to behave yourself and be a good neighbor, but if it\u2019s just for a weekend, it\u2019s probably just to party,\u201d Fran Donovan, a local mental health therapist, said on Thursday while enjoying an iced tea at the Golden Pear Cafe on Newtown Lane. Ms. Donovan said one of her patients\u2019 top anxieties these days was the explosion of short-term rentals.A house down the block from hers has already been rented out online to large parties twice this season. \u201cDoes my business benefit from people coming out? Of course,\u201d she said, referring to her seasonal clients. \u201cBut it seems like everyone\u2019s trying to ride the gravy train, and if they\u2019re not careful, it\u2019s going to crash.\u201dNext door to the Golden Pear, another local resident, who gave his name as Chris, was participating in this new economy. He had just deposited a check for a one-week rental his wife had arranged through HomeAway.Chris, who had the dirty baseball cap of a former farmer, had moved with his wife into a ranch home they owned in the less expensive village of Springs so they could rent out their cottage in East Hampton village for the season, a first for them.\u201cWe were kind of ignorant of the sites, but things weren\u2019t happening with the brokers, so we put it up online and were just flooded with offers,\u201d said Chris, who did not want to give his full name after he was informed that he might be breaking the law. \u201cFrom one weeks to threes, we\u2019re booked up all summer.\u201dIn East Hampton, a home can be rented for less than two weeks only twice every six months. There are also rules about no more than four unrelated adults\u2019 sharing a property or four cars per home, among other restrictions. Obedience of the rules has never been universal \u2014 the term \u201cHamptons summer share\u201d conjures images of multitudes of 20-somethings sleeping on air mattresses. But when the recession hit, and renters found maybe they did not have $100,000 for the month of August, rental periods began getting shorter.With the rise of the online operators, the trend grew, in part because the sites streamlined the process and cut out real estate agents, who traditionally served as gatekeepers.Larry Cantwell, the East Hampton town supervisor, was elected last year in part on a platform of rental reform, to protect his picturesque villages from the barbarians at the dunes.\u201cWe can\u2019t patrol 20,000 houses to see if it\u2019s the same people every week,\u201d he said, \u201cso we have to get smart about how we pursue these cases.\u201d\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s as simple as finding one too many reviews in a six-month period,\u201d Mr. Betts said.Yet when even people in government eagerly rent out their places online \u2014 one town employee said a colleague was \u201cmaking a killing,\u201d and a Suffolk County legislator, Jay Schneiderman, is advertising his Montauk three-bedroom on VRBO for $1,000 a night, though with a 15-night minimum \u2014 the websites make the case that they are the good guys working to improve the marketplace.\u201cWe help people afford their dream second home, and we help people afford their dream vacation, especially in these popular destinations where the rooms get booked up,\u201d said Jon Gray, a senior vice president at HomeAway.Since 2010, the number of Hamptons listings on the site has doubled, to 2,061, with inquiries more than doubling as well. On Airbnb, which declined to comment, the number of listings was similar, though many owners list on multiple sites.Some have suggested the sites could use programming tactics to stop owners from skirting the law, such as by tracking the number of short-term rentals in East Hampton and forbidding more than two. The sites, however, counter that this would be too cumbersome.\u201cWith a million properties, you end up having immensely different regulations,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cWe\u2019re an advertising platform, not a taxing authority or regulatory agency, but we do try to inform our owners of their obligations all the same.\u201dThis reporter found that majestic Lake Montauk rental on Airbnb. As it turns out, the host did not own the place, but was renting it from the owner, another violation of town code. She knew it, too, warning this reporter to steer clear when the owner was expected to drop in.Not every new Hamptons landlord is flouting the law, of course. Cindy Tanenbaum, who bought an 1880s farmhouse outside the village of East Hampton last spring, had some success last summer with a broker, but said things really took off when a friend suggested she try Airbnb. She is booked through October, all with rentals long enough to be legal.\u201cI was able to cover my overhead costs and bring in a $30,000 yearly profit,\u201d said Ms. Tanenbaum, a public relations professional who lives most of the year in Manhattan. \u201cI almost wish I\u2019d bought years ago, though I guess I wouldn\u2019t have had Airbnb then.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Today it is less likely to be depicted as a ferocious predator than as a friendly dolphin-like character with a toothy grin. A sign near Lighthouse Beach in Chatham encouraged people to post their photos and videos of sharks.\u00a0CHATHAM, Mass. \u2014 One store offers pastel baby bootees with felt shark teeth for toes. Christmas ornaments have Santa perched on the back of a shark with a wreath around its neck. The local school district has adopted the shark as its mascot.After the nearly 40 years since \u201cJaws\u201d first flashed its pearly whites on the silver screen, the mindless man-devouring machine at the center of the terror has been rebranded. Today it is less likely to be depicted as a ferocious predator than as a friendly dolphin-like character with a toothy grin.Nowhere is the transformation more evident than here in this 350-year-old seaside town at the elbow of Cape Cod. With its spread of sandy beaches and inlets dotted with pleasure craft and fishing vessels, Chatham could have been the model for the fictional town of Amity in the movie, which was filmed on nearby Martha\u2019s Vineyard. When sharks started cropping up here a few years ago, the town leaders at first feared they would flatline the robust tourist economy.But instead of turning a blind eye like those in the movie, Chatham\u2019s merchants and hoteliers embraced the sharks\u2019 arrival.\u201cWhen you have lemons, you make lemonade, and this was one of the great opportunities to do so,\u201d said Shareen Davis, a commercial fisher, gallery owner and descendant of one of the original families that settled in Chatham in the 1600s.\u201cAttitudes have changed,\u201d said Kevin McLain, executive director of the Chatham Orpheum Theater, the town\u2019s restored movie house, where \u201cJaws\u201d is playing twice a day throughout the summer.\u201cThere\u2019s a line in the movie, that if you yell \u2018Shark!\u2019 on the Fourth of July, we\u2019re going to have a panic on our hands,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Chatham now, you yell \u2018Shark!\u2019 in the middle of town, people come running to the beach, not away from it.\u201dThe other day, beachgoers here saw what they believed to be a great white snare a seal, the two animals thrashing around as the water turned redder. A father in the group told The Cape Cod Chronicle that his children were not frightened by the scene but rather were \u201cjumping up and down\u201d with excitement.One of the people most responsible for the shift in perception is Greg Skomal, a state marine biologist and shark specialist. He has led efforts to tag and track the behemoths for decades in New England and conveys his enthusiasm in well-attended lectures to vacationers up and down the Cape.\u201cThe white shark is the holy grail of species \u2014 it\u2019s an iconic, charismatic shark that everybody wants to see,\u201d Dr. Skomal told about 50 people in Truro last week during a breezy talk titled \u201cWhite Sharks I Have Known, Loved and Learned From.\u201d It included eye-popping slides and video of great whites with names like Gretel (\u201cbecause she was lost\u201d) and Large Marge.Dr. Skomal says that great whites are not interested in human fodder. People are not as blubbery as a seal or the carcass of a whale, which is their top menu choice. A great white in 2012 took what Dr. Skomal called a \u201ctest bite\u201d out of a tourist from Denver who had been swimming near seals in Truro, but it swam away after the man kicked it. It was the first great white attack on a human in Massachusetts in 76 years.The creatures may have long lurked in New England waters. But they are closer to shore now because their chief food source, the gray seal, has returned in abundance. The seals were nearly wiped out decades ago by fishermen, who killed them because they snatched their fish. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 ended the slaughter of seals, and the population has exploded, setting up an all-you-can-eat buffet for hungry great whites.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of these animals just because every now and then they bite someone,\u201d Dr. Skomal said. \u201cThey\u2019re important members of the ecosystem and we need to have them here.\u201dMike Meserve, a retiree visiting from Washington, said his takeaway from Dr. Skomal\u2019s lecture was this: \u201cThe sense of menace from the \u2018Jaws\u2019 effect has worn off almost completely. The reality is, there\u2019s no real reason to be afraid.\u201dBut when Dr. Skomal began tagging great whites near here in 2009, many were nervous.\u201cIt was like, how do we pull this together so we don\u2019t scare everyone?\u201d said Sandy Wycoff, owner of the Chatham Clothing Bar, which features some shark apparel. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be Amity.\u201dSlowly, the question resolved itself. The sightings increased. Taggings increased. Tourists started asking where they could see the great whites and, eventually, businesses started catering to the interest.\u201cThe merchants are capitalizing on the fact that the sharks are here and people come, and this is what they\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Lisa Franz, executive director of the Chatham Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThe demand is there, so basically the town is supplying it.\u201dSome vacationers think the town \u201ctook the bait,\u201d in the words of Ryan Brigden, 17, who was swimming off Lighthouse Beach the other day with an uncle, Chris Conway.\u201cMaybe it was a calculated move by the town and the press to make it exciting here,\u201d said Mr. Conway. Embracing the sharks was \u201cgenius,\u201d he said, but all that would change with a fatality. \u201cThere will be one,\u201d he predicted.The tourist economy was already flourishing in Chatham, where the winter population of 6,600 soars in the summer to 30,000, even before the attraction of the sharks.\u201cBut this could have gone in a whole other direction, and the economy could have suffered if people were afraid,\u201d said Jennifer Allard, marketing manager for the Chatham Bars Inn, an upscale resort hotel.\u201cNot only are people still coming, but they\u2019re still going on kayak tours, seal tours and boating excursions and still swimming in the ocean,\u201d she said.What they are not doing is signing up for the $5,000 shark-watch excursions that the inn offered last year with spotter planes. Instead, the inn is offering a $50 boat ride out to a buoy with Marianne Long, a recreation manager at the inn and a volunteer for the new shark conservancy, who talks enthusiastically about sharks as she checks a receiver to see if any tagged sharks have cruised by.So far, none have.An earlier version of a picture caption in the slide show with this article incorrectly stated that Mike Steinbaum was watching the film \u201cJaws\u201d for the first time.

{"Headline": "Bank of England Leaves Key Interest Rate Unchanged", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Bank of England on Thursday left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low as policy makers seek to balance Britain\u2019s robust economic recovery with the need to cool an overheating housing market.Britain\u2019s central bank said it would keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. The bank also left unchanged a stimulus program of holding 375 billion pounds, or about $642 billion, in government bonds that it has purchased over the past five years.The bank had not been expected to act, but bank officials have hinted in recent weeks that a rate increase may happen sooner than the market anticipates.Analysts generally have said that they do not expect interest rates to rise in Britain before late this year or early next year, but a robust housing market and strong employment data may force the hand of policy makers.The British economy recorded growth of 0.8 percent in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter, and has outpaced much of Continental Europe. Growth in the second quarter may have risen further, to 0.9 percent, according to an estimate published this week by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, an independent body.\u201cBased on our estimates, the U.K. economy is now 3.2 percent larger than in the same period last year,\u201d the institute said on Tuesday.The vote on Thursday by Monetary Policy Committee members was unanimous. The last vote by a committee member to raise rates came in July 2011, according to the Bank of England.The apparent harmony in recent months \u201cmay be hiding bigger disagreements behind the scenes,\u201d Robert Wood, an economist at Berenberg, said in a research note. \u201cThe minutes of today\u2019s meeting, due in two weeks, will be key for judging how the consensus is changing.\u201dMr. Wood said that he believes a rate increase is likely in November.Samuel Tombs, an economist at the research firm Capital Economics, said he does not expect the committee to act before the first quarter of 2015. The cooling of the housing market in the coming months and the likely easing of inflation \u201csuggests that the committee is likely to refrain from raising\u201d rates before next year, Mr. Tombs said in a research note on Thursday. Britain\u2019s inflation rate in May fell further below the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target, to 1.5 percent.Government officials have expressed particular concern about the housing market in Britain, where a shortage of housing stock has rapidly pushed up prices, particularly in London and parts of southeast England. In a recent survey, the mortgage lender Nationwide said housing prices were up 25 percent in London in the past year.George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, recently said that the housing shortage was perhaps the greatest threat to the country\u2019s economic recovery, in part because house buyers are taking on too much debt.Last month, Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, announced a series of measures aimed at cooling the housing market.The measures included restricting the number of new residential mortgages on a bank\u2019s loan portfolio that are equivalent to, or more than 4.5 times, a borrower\u2019s annual income. Under the move, banks can have no more than 15 percent of such loans in their portfolios.The discussions about the threat of rising housing prices may already be having an impact.In its latest housing data released on Thursday, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that 53 percent of housing industry professionals that it surveyed reported an increase in housing prices in June, down from 56 percent in May. The rate of price increases in London also appears to be easing, the institution said.Simon Rubinsohn, the institution\u2019s chief economist, said that \u201crhetoric from key officials at the bank, including Mark Carney, alongside the consequences of the introduction of the mortgage market review are already slowing momentum, particularly in London.\u201dMr. Carney has been criticized by some for sending mixed signals to the market about the timing of any rate increases.Mr. Carney has suggested that it would be difficult to raise rates above 2.5 percent and that the earliest the central bank could reach that level would be 2017. That compares with what has traditionally been considered by central bankers as a \u201cnormal\u201d rate of about 5 percent.The rate decision comes after the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it was planning to stop adding to its bond holdings later this year, a sign of confidence in the United States economy. The bond-buying program was one of the central bank\u2019s most aggressive efforts to stimulate the economy.But the Fed suggested in minutes from its June meeting that investors should not interpret the end of its bond purchases as a sign that interest rates would rise sooner in the United States.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Raising Stakes on Russia, U.S. Adds Sanctions", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama imposed a new round of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday, targeting some of the crown jewels of the country\u2019s financial, energy and defense industries in what officials described as the most punishing measures taken to date by the United States in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s intervention in Ukraine.The new actions will, among other things, restrict access to American capital markets for Russian giants like the Rosneft oil company and Gazprombank that operate worldwide. While the latest moves did not cut off entire sectors of the Russian economy, they went significantly further than the financial and travel limits imposed previously on several dozen individuals and their businesses.The announcement reflected a decision by Mr. Obama to take more stringent steps than those taken by the United States\u2019 European allies, which have far deeper economic ties to Russia. Meeting in Brussels, leaders of the European Union refused to match the American measures and instead adopted a more tempered plan that blocks new development loans to Russia and threatens to target more Russian individuals.The disparate moves suggested a widening gulf in the response to the crisis in Ukraine and may dilute the impact of the American actions. But both sides emphasized their continued solidarity on the basic demands that Moscow halt the flow of fighters and weapons across the border with Ukraine, support a cease-fire and help facilitate the release of hostages held by pro-Russian separatists.\u201cWhat we are expecting is that the Russian leadership will see, once again, that its actions in Ukraine have consequences, including a weakening Russian economy and increasing diplomatic isolation,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters in an early-evening appearance in the White House briefing room.Russia quickly denounced the moves and vowed to retaliate. \u201cWe condemn those politicians and bureaucrats who are behind such actions,\u201d Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, told the Interfax news agency. Mr. Ryabkov said that Moscow would respond with countermeasures that would be \u201cquite painful and serious.\u201dPresident Vladimir V. Putin said the sanctions would boomerang and push relations between the United States and Russia to a dead end.The sanctions harm \u201cthe national long-term interests of the American state, the American people,\u201d Mr. Putin told reporters Wednesday evening in Brasilia at the end of a six-day trip to Latin America.\u201cIt\u2019s a great pity that our partners are following this path,\u201d the Russian president said. \u201cBut our doors are open for the negotiating process, for a way out of this situation.\u201dThe firms targeted by the capital market restrictions were some of the most prominent in Russia. Rosneft, owned by the state and headed by a longtime adviser to President Vladimir V. Putin, is the country\u2019s largest oil producer.Gazprombank is the financial arm of Gazprom, the state-controlled natural gas giant, which is also headed by a Putin ally. Also targeted were VEB, the state economic development bank, and Novatek, another natural gas producer.The administration also barred business dealings with eight state-owned defense firms; four Russian government officials, including an aide to Mr. Putin and a top official in the Federal Security Service; an oil shipping facility in Crimea, which Moscow annexed; a pro-Russian separatist leader; and the rump rebel organizations in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.The four banks and energy companies will be barred from future loans with a maturity of more than 90 days, meaning they will still be able to conduct day-to-day business with overnight capital but will find themselves shut out of longer-term equity.Some officials and experts said it could raise the cost of borrowing for Russian firms as they seek other creditors who may be wary of future American steps.Gazprombank has $8.2 billion in debt over 90 days denominated in American dollars, and while some of that may have come through European or other institutions, officials said the vast majority of it could not be financed, cleared and settled without involving participants in the United States capital markets who would be affected by the new measures.Mr. Obama\u2019s actions would not bar the targeted Russian banks or energy companies from doing business with Americans or seize their property. Rosneft, for instance, has major joint ventures with ExxonMobil that will still be permitted. But administration officials pointedly noted that such moves were still possible if Russia did not back down.Craig Pirrong, a professor of finance at the University of Houston, said the current moves might not have that much impact because the affected companies could get American dollars elsewhere. \u201cThis will constrain to some degree the size of the capital pool that the sanctioned firms can access, but not nearly as much as could be,\u201d he said.Douglas A. Rediker, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the actual exposure to the American capital market may be small. \u201cBut the chilling effect on hitting sizable banks and energy companies could cause major second thoughts for doing business and investing far beyond direct U.S. capital market impact,\u201d he said.Others were more skeptical of the political impact. \u201cWhat happens if this doesn\u2019t work?\u201d asked Samuel Charap, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The \u201crisks of escalation seem huge,\u201d he added, \u201cand there\u2019s a question of whether this level of pain makes losing Ukraine acceptable to Putin. Unlikely, in my view.\u201dSeveral lawmakers from both parties praised Mr. Obama\u2019s move, but some Republicans called it inadequate. \u201cLimited actions like those announced today make U.S. threats look hollow,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, adding that Mr. Obama was \u201ccontinuing to avoid decisive action.\u201dAmerican business groups have objected to unilateral sanctions, arguing that they would only hurt domestic businesses while their European competitors swooped in.The National Association of Manufacturers said it \u201cis disappointed that the U.S. is fundamentally extending sanctions in increasingly unilateral ways that will undermine U.S. commercial engagement and reduce the effectiveness of the measures imposed.\u201dMr. Obama tried to address that concern on Wednesday. \u201cThese sanctions are significant, but they are also targeted, designed to have the maximum impact on Russia while limiting any spillover effects on American companies or those of our allies,\u201d the president said.The latest actions reflect a conclusion by American intelligence agencies that Russia has not cut off the flow of fighters and arms across the border to pro-Russian separatists.Ukrainian officials have said they believe Russia was responsible for the downing on Monday of a military transport plane in Luhansk, a rebel stronghold.An American official briefing reporters on Wednesday said that the plane was shot down from an altitude of 21,000 feet, and that only a sophisticated weapons system could do that. \u201cOver the past month, the flow of heavy weapons and support for separatists from Russia has actually increased,\u201d the official said.The White House summoned European ambassadors on Monday to show them new intelligence on Russian involvement in the Ukrainian turmoil and press them to take stronger action.Mr. Obama called his British and French counterparts, but the critical call came Tuesday with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the driving force behind Europe\u2019s response to Russia, when the two coordinated the actions on Wednesday.In Brussels, the European Council, which defines the European Union\u2019s political direction and priorities, told the European Investment Bank to suspend new financing for projects in Russia and suggested that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development follow suit.The council also said it would decide by the end of July on a list of additional sanctions targets, including those \u201cwho actively provide material or financial support to the Russian decision-makers.\u201dThat language suggested that Europe might next take aim at Russian oligarchs who are part of Mr. Putin\u2019s ruling clique, a group already penalized by the Americans but so far spared by the Europeans.\u201cOf course, it is a deepening of the economic sanctions,\u201d Ms. Merkel said after the meeting. Whether it is as much as previously threatened, she added, \u201cWe are entering the economic sphere here.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on July 17 about new sanctions imposed by the United States on Russia to retaliate for its intervention in Ukraine misstated, in some editions, the day that a Ukrainian military transport plane was downed in Luhansk, Ukraine, an act for which Ukraine blamed Russia. It occurred on July 14, not on June 14.Peter Baker reported from Washington, and James Kanter from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wine From a Sacred Place", "Date": "2014-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesIf you travel widely enough around the grape-growing regions of the world, you gather ample testimony of the driving, historic human desire to make good wine. What else could explain the compulsion to plant vines on ridiculously steep hillsides in the Mosel and the Rheingau, in the northern Rh\u00f4ne Valley, in Priorat and the Douro, and in Ribeira Sacra in the Galicia region of northwestern Spain?Thousands of years before the lucrative global wine economy of today, Romans carved terraces on slopes in Ribeira Sacra that rose at precipitous angles from the rivers below. They planted vines to keep themselves supplied with wine. Over the centuries, monks expanded and maintained the network of vines, which was farmed by the church and by locals, for whom grapes were just one of many subsistence crops. It was not a matter of survival \u2014 grains and produce planted on the flats saw to that. The backbreaking labor these vines required was a matter of choice.Nor was it an economic necessity. Until fairly recently, Ribeira Sacra was largely cut off from the rest of Spain, though a few farmers shipped wine by river to Lugo, a city to the north, mostly for local consumption.At the end of the 19th century, grape phylloxera, a ravenous aphid that preys on the roots of European vines, destroyed much of the crop. Agricultural disaster was followed by economic depression, civil war and dictatorship. Many of the historical terraces were abandoned, and the children of farmers left for work in the cities.Then a curious thing happened. Near the end of the 20th century, people began to return to Ribeira Sacra. Disillusioned by the city, perhaps, or drawn by the promise of the slate-and-granite soils at a time when other once-obscure Spanish wine regions were developing worldwide reputations, they came back to replant the vines and renew the terraces. The hills of Ribeira Sacra came alive again.I visited Ribeira Sacra in 2009, at a nascent point in its revival, just as its wines were beginning to make an international impact. Five years later, it seemed time for the wine panel to survey the region, so we tasted 17 red wines from recent vintages. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Ashley Santoro, wine director at the Standard East Village restaurants, including Narcissa, and Gil Avital, wine director at Tertulia in Greenwich Village.Ordinarily we would taste 20 bottles for a cross-section of a particular region. But few Ribeira Sacra producers are imported to the United States. Even by including multiple cuv\u00e9es from several producers, the best we could do was 17 bottles. But that was enough to clearly demonstrate the distinctive, unusual character of these wines.Unlike most Spanish reds, these are cool-climate wines, defined as much by the rainy, temperate Atlantic coast as the soils, the slopes and the people who farm them. The reds are made predominantly of the menc\u00eda grape, which is also the basis for the reds of the Bierzo region to the east. But where the Bierzo wines tend to be denser and burlier, the best reds of Ribeira Sacra epitomize juicy freshness. These are lively, graceful wines, with the same sort of aromatic loveliness and lissome body that draws people to Burgundy and Barolo.I\u2019m speaking of the young wines. Ribeira Sacra, though ancient, is still early enough in its renewal that we don\u2019t know how the wines will age. Not that age-worthy wines are not being made. Our No. 4 wine, the 2011 El Pecado from Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez, has the richness and intensity to age for years, while maintaining a lightness of texture that is a hallmark of Ribeira Sacra. The mystery is how it will evolve. Will it develop the complex secondary and tertiary aromas and flavors that characterize precious Burgundies and Barolos? Or will it simply endure and grow mellow, without the intricacy of a profound wine? Let\u2019s check in 15 years.El Pecado was by far the most ambitious (and, at $97, expensive) wine in the tasting. Our No. 1 bottle, the 2010 Lalama from Dominio do Bibei, was graceful, fresh and complex. It\u2019s a wine intended for early consumption, and it\u2019s at a joyous peak right now. Bibei also makes a more ambitious, age-worthy cuv\u00e9e, Lacima, which we did not have in the tasting, though it is well worth seeking out.Ribeira Sacra already excels at making wines like Lalama, full of deliciousness at an early stage. Our No. 2 bottle, the 2012 menc\u00eda from Algueira, was spicy and wild, with a slatelike minerality. At $16, it was also our best value. The 2011 Vi\u00f1a Caneiro from D. Ventura, our No. 5 bottle, was so juicy, fruity and floral, with an underlying mineral element, that it seemed to scream, \u201cDrink me!\u201dAlgueira\u2019s slightly more complex menc\u00eda wine, the 2010 Pizarra, aged in old oak barrels rather than steel tanks, was our No. 3 bottle, neck and neck with the other Algueira. Perhaps it was slightly riper and more complex, but not quite as vivacious. A third Algueira wine, the 2011 Fincas, was our No. 10 bottle. Unlike the other two, this was made of the caino tinto grape, also known as borra\u00e7al. It was richer and maybe a little shriller than the menc\u00eda wines, without their delicacy and complexity.It used to be said that menc\u00eda was related to cabernet franc. Although this has been shown genetically not to be true, it\u2019s easy to see why people may have seen a relationship when drinking a wine like our No. 6 bottle, the 2010 Capeli\u00f1os from Gu\u00edmaro, a fascinating, tart wine that leavened its herbaceous quality with flavors of red fruits. Gu\u00edmaro also makes a simpler cuv\u00e9e from the Amandi subregion. The 2011 vintage of this cuv\u00e9e, our No. 9 bottle, was dark, earthy and almost exotic.Having visited this region, and having seen firsthand the grueling labor required to farm it properly, I couldn\u2019t help developing an emotional attachment to the wines. Nonetheless, I believe that in the best wines you can taste the passion and devotion of the producers, which is part of what makes Ribeira Sacra so distinctive. While the region is known for its reds, it also produces some excellent white wines, made primarily from the godello grape. But that\u2019s another story for another time.Email: asimov@nytimes.com.

{"Headline": "China Takes Step Toward Freeing Currency from State Control", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China has permitted banks to freely set their own exchange rates for the renminbi against the dollar in over-the-counter transactions \u2014 another step toward freeing the exchange rate from government control.Banks were previously required to price the exchange rate that they offered clients within 3 percent in either direction of the Chinese central bank\u2019s midpoint on a given day.The liberalization of the market implies that the central bank believes that the renminbi has \u201cnow reached equilibrium,\u201d said Cao Yang, an analyst with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. Such equilibrium permits the central bank to gradually free the currency\u2019s exchange rate without worrying about excessive volatility, he said.The new rules do not apply to the currency\u2019s main rate in the interbank market, which is subject to controls including the central bank\u2019s setting a daily midpoint from which the spot rate has been allowed to fluctuate in either direction by 2 percent since March.Under the new policy, effective immediately, banks can price over-the-counter exchange rates \u201cin line with market supply and demand and without any restrictions\u201d, the People\u2019s Bank of China said in a statement published late on Wednesday. The move \u201cis aimed at further perfecting the mechanisms to establish market-oriented exchange rate for the yuan,\u201d the central bank added.But the wholesale market that the banks trade in must still abide by the midpoint guidance rate. Because that primary market is an enormous source of currency supply and demand, posting around $15 billion in transactions every day, it will continue to exercise a strong influence on the consumer market.China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States, is seeking to increase the use of the renminbi in global trade and investment to diminish China\u2019s dependence on the dollar, and, by extension, its exposure to economic policy decisions made in Washington outside of its control.Allowing the market to price the renminbi against the dollar is a prerequisite for wider liberalization, and at the same time decreases the need for Beijing to accrue dollar reserves in the name of managing the exchange rate.The central bank has purposefully guided the yuan to stage more two-way trading over the past couple of years, letting the currency appreciate 2.9 percent versus the dollar in 2013, only to push it down as much as 3.4 percent this year to persuade the market not to consider the currency a one-way bet on appreciation.Chinese companies, which obtain foreign currencies both at the interbank market and, with a lesser degree, via banks\u2019 over-the-counter channels, welcomed the move.\u201cThe opening will have a positive impact on corporate foreign exchange deals,\u201d said Wang Xinjiu, securities affairs representative at the China International Marine Containers Group, the world\u2019s top container producer.\u201cCompanies, just like individuals, will have better channels to meet their foreign exchange demand with more reasonable exchange rates,\u201d he said.The latest step comes ahead of bilateral economic talks between the United States and China this month, during which American officials are expected to raise their concerns about Beijing\u2019s interventions in the currency market.Critics say China artificially suppresses the value of the renminbi to protect its exporters, an accusation China has always denied.The United States Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, who will attend the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Beijing this month, said on Tuesday the renminbi\u2019s value was a \u201cvery big issue\u201d for the United States and that the currency needed to appreciate more.Robert Minikin, a foreign exchange strategist in Hong Kong for Standard Chartered, said that he believed that Beijing was also preparing to change the way it managed the market in general, and that the freeing of the market could be a step in that direction.Economists have pointed out that so long as Beijing continues to set an official midpoint rate, it retains a tool for controlling the exchange rate; and so long as the interbank market is restrained by a trading band, the market is not truly in charge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chinese Gold Standard?", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 While the 70th anniversary of D-Day last month received a lot of attention, another event, in July 1944 \u2014 the Bretton Woods conference, named for the mountain resort in New Hampshire where it was held \u2014 was perhaps even more significant in shaping the modern world. It not only led to the creation of what are now the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, but it also confirmed the central position of the United States dollar in the international monetary system. Why does this matter for us now? Just as America displaced Britain as the world\u2019s pre-eminent economic power in the interwar period, so, too, the large debts and fiscal pressures confronting the West, and the rise of China and other economic powers, challenge us to think about the future of finance. For most of the 19th century the British pound had been the world\u2019s \u201creserve currency,\u201d the currency in which trade and finance were denominated. \u201cAs sound as a pound\u201d became a widely used expression. The pound was pegged to gold at a fixed rate of just under \u00a34 per ounce.At the outbreak of World War I, Britain abandoned the gold standard. You could no longer exchange pounds for gold. The gold standard was reintroduced in 1925, but this, as John Maynard Keynes observed, proved to be an economic mistake.British prices and, more crucially, wages, would have to be forced down by 10 percent to maintain the competitiveness of British exports. As American agricultural and industrial exports soared in the 1920s and 1930s, the dollar effectively replaced the pound. It was American bankers who helped out the financially strapped Weimar Republic in the 1920s. The British, as exporters of capital, were a diminished force. By the time of Bretton Woods, the United States held roughly 60 percent of the world\u2019s gold supply. \u201cThink of the gold in Fort Knox,\u201d America\u2019s chief negotiator at Bretton Woods, Harry Dexter White, said. \u201cThat is why we are in a powerful position.\u201d He added, \u201cWe have the wherewithal to buy any currency we want.\u201dBretton Woods fixed the dollar price of gold at $35 per ounce, and all the other major currencies \u2014 the pound, the franc, the mark, the yen \u2014 were subsequently pegged to the dollar, even though they could not be exchanged directly for gold. This system lasted until 1971. By then, America was under the financial strain of the Vietnam War and Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society. With mounting deficits and an adverse balance of trade, America struggled to maintain gold convertibility at the old rate of $35 an ounce. So President Richard M. Nixon abandoned the fixed dollar price of gold established at Bretton Woods (over the objections of the Federal Reserve chairman, Arthur F. Burns). International critics said that the United States, by ending the dollar link to gold, was turning its back on its responsibilities as the guarantor of the international monetary system. Over the decades, the situation has gotten worse. The United States is $17.6 trillion in debt owed to the public, and large trade deficits are the norm. Yet there is no scope for revisiting the international monetary system, despite great dissatisfaction by countries like China and the Persian Gulf states, which hold large foreign currency reserves. Americans themselves question the security of the dollar when their country faces such large trade and budget deficits. China\u2019s nearly $4 trillion in reserves \u2014 accumulated through its mercantilist trade policies \u2014 give it plenty of ammunition to claim leadership in the creation of a new monetary order. The Chinese, however, are most unlikely to bid for monetary hegemony in the near future. For the past 25 years they have pursued a policy of aggressive export growth to drive their economy. China successively devalued its currency, from 1.50 renminbi to the dollar in 1980, to 8.72 in 1994. (Today the renminbi trades at 6.20 to the dollar, which the United States still considers artificially low.) Could China someday peg its currency to gold, as Britain did in 1821? China has the reserves to do this, and it could have the political will, if the dollar proved to be unreliable as a store of value in the future. Of course, Britain\u2019s earlier adoption of the gold standard, in 1821, worsened a sharp deflationary period, during which, according to one calculation, consumer prices fell nearly 50 percent, between 1818 and 1822. Nevertheless, to its supporters the gold standard ensured British fiscal and monetary dominance during the rest of the 19th century. As the British historian A.J.P. Taylor observed, 19th-century Britons believed that \u201ca country could not flourish without a balanced budget and a gold currency.\u201d Since Keynes, the West has tried to deny this proposition, with our reliance on deficit spending and \u201cfiat\u201d money, backed mainly by the expectation that a government will not default on its debts. China is not as indebted as the West, but it is looking to \u201crebalance\u201d its economy by raising demand by consumers, who want to enjoy the standard of living enjoyed across the Western world. Since 2010, the renminbi has appreciated 14 percent without drastically hurting Chinese exports. Having expanded its manufacturing base and captured international markets, China may well find a world hooked on its products. It could eventually \u2014 in, say, 20 years \u2014 peg the renminbi to gold, considering it preferable to the dollar as a store of value, because of its permanence and longevity. With a balanced budget and a gold-backed currency, China\u2019s economy could be even more formidable than it is today. Such a move would truly mark its return as the \u201cMiddle Kingdom.\u201d Hard as it may be to contemplate today, this scenario would, in many ways, be a more secure basis for an international monetary regime system than the system of floating exchange rates that Nixon inadvertently created in 1971, one that forever overturned the Bretton Woods order.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Hurdle to Fast Action on Climate Change", "Date": "2014-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWhen the Environmental Protection Agency published in June its new rules to combat carbon emissions from power plants, the American political class lit up in debates over what this meant for the country\u2019s carbon emissions, its coal industry and its economic growth.But a more relevant discussion was taking place some 7,000 miles away. In Beijing, He Jiankun, an academic and deputy director of China\u2019s Advisory Committee on Climate Change, told a conference that China, the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas polluter, would for the first time put \u201can absolute cap\u201d on its emissions.His comments, and the brief flurry set off over whether they represented government policy, highlight a little-appreciated feature of the long-running, often acrimonious debate over how to slow climate change. The most pressing issue is not whether the United States will manage to wean itself from coal, or even about how quickly the American economy can reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.The most pressing issue is to what extent and under which conditions China will participate in the global effort to combat climate change. Any hopes that American commitments to cut carbon emissions will have a decisive impact on climate change rely on the assumption that China will reciprocate and deliver aggressive emission cuts of its own.China could presumably decarbonize faster. While the Chinese government has not yet imposed a cap, it has acknowledged the need to rein in rising carbon emissions. Still, improving on these forecasts will not be an easy call. At best, they will require a lot of new technology.Alternatively, it could accept a substantially slower pace of economic growth. But considering that the average Chinese earns about one-fifth as much as the average American, the government in Beijing is unlikely to follow this path.Can the United States or anybody else do anything to speed China down a low-carbon path?Heads of state from around the world will be gathering in September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly to start a new international climate agreement, due to be signed at a summit meeting in Paris next year.They come off a big defeat. In 2009, the Copenhagen conference on climate change broke down to a large extent because big developing countries like China refused to accept legally binding commitments on emission cuts, which might constrain their future development.Fortunately, the United States seems to have learned from past climate negotiation mistakes. In 1997, the Senate blew up the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon emissions even before it was finalized \u2014 formally urging the White House not to sign it unless it included legal commitments by developing countries.The Obama administration\u2019s new rules on power plants, by contrast, are not contingent on the actions of anybody else. By unilaterally offering up American emission cuts, they might get more in return.The United States pledged then that greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 would be 17 percent lower than in 2005, which, compared with the business-as-usual path, amounts to a reduction of one billion tons. Trevor Houser, who heads the energy practice at the Rhodium Group, an economic modeling firm, calculates that this American commitment was crucial in unlocking commitments by other countries worth two billion to five billion tons.\u201cThis is not a bad leverage ratio,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we know that U.S. leadership elicits reciprocal action from other countries.\u201dThis may be a useful precedent for future negotiations. After all, countries cannot really commit to cutting carbon emissions in the way that they commit to cut tariff barriers on trade. Forcing legally binding tariffs might discourage countries from shooting for ambitious goals. Public voluntary commitments that are attached to a rigorous and transparent monitoring process could be more effective.It is nonetheless far from clear whether this kind of approach gets us where we want to be. Not everybody will meet their Copenhagen pledges. Japan, which unplugged its nuclear energy after the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, will fall behind. So will Canada and Australia, whose new conservative governments have lost interest in the pledges of their predecessors.Most importantly, the Copenhagen commitments are nowhere near big enough. China, for instance, committed to improve its carbon efficiency but made no promise on carbon emissions. It must offer more.American officials are confident that offering unilateral emissions cuts can persuade the Chinese to offer real commitments that might have a chance to keep global temperatures in check.But the incentive goes only so far. For China, the existential question remains whether it can simultaneously decarbonize and grow. If it cannot do both things at once, chances are it will choose the second.The Chinese government is still figuring out how much it can afford to participate.Email: eporter@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sheep Power at a San Antonio Solar Farm", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTexas TribuneSAN ANTONIO \u2014 The landscapers at a 45-acre solar farm northeast of downtown do not complain that they are paid only in shrubbery. After about three months, the bleating crew has kept the grounds well maintained. Since April, the site\u2019s operator, OCI Solar Power, has used about 90 Barbados-cross sheep as a low-cost, low-effort solution to controlling the overgrowth that would otherwise impede the company\u2019s technicians. The 4.4-megawatt solar farm where the sheep graze is part of a series of 400-megawatt plants that CPS Energy, San Antonio\u2019s municipal utility, plans to add to its portfolio by 2016. On average, a megawatt of solar energy can heat and cool as many as 100 Texas homes on an August day. During average temperatures, it can power many times more. (CPS Energy is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)\u201cThe sheep have done a really good job of keeping it nice,\u201d Sara Krueger, an OCI Solar spokeswoman, said as she watched seven of them chomp the pasture between two rows of solar panels. \u201cThey seem to be moving naturally around the site.\u201d Sheep grazing is not a widespread practice at Texas solar farms, but it has been utilized elsewhere, particularly in California and parts of Europe. Contracting with a local breeder to bring sheep to a solar installation is cheaper than hiring two-legged groundskeepers, companies say, and easier than trying to maneuver lawn equipment in tight spaces. Sharing the land also helps the local agricultural economy, industry leaders say. At the San Antonio plant, which is home to thousands of solar panels, OCI Solar describes its grazing as an experiment that has worked well. The meandering sheep appear to have done their job; patches of grass reach no higher than a foot despite recent heavy rains. The sheep have not chewed on cables or jumped on panels, which goats \u2014 their equally hungry cousins \u2014 are more apt to do. The lone mishap thus far, Ms. Krueger said, came when one wily sheep sneaked through a gap in a locked gate. OCI Solar teamed with a local police officer and a resident to corral the animal within 30 minutes.The sheep receive fresh water on site and can take refuge from the Texas sun beneath the solar panels, which extend several feet off the ground.OCI Solar recently unleashed additions to its grazing operation: two herding dogs, both Great Pyrenees mixes, intended to ward off coyotes. On a recent afternoon that topped 90 degrees, one of the high-energy pups spent half an hour bounding alongside a reporter and his hosts, showing more interest in getting belly rubs and finding shade beneath the solar panels than protecting sheep.The company plans to keep the flock of sheep on site for 10 months, at which point a Texas breeder will rotate a new team in. The company is also considering adding sheep at its much larger, 41-megawatt plant in hopes that the sheep will be able to cover all 500 acres. jmalewitz@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Presses Perry to Rally Support for Border Funds", "Date": "2014-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDALLAS \u2014 President Obama on Wednesday directly challenged Gov. Rick Perry of Texas to rally Republicans in support of a $3.7 billion emergency measure aimed at solving the humanitarian crisis caused as thousands of Central American children have crossed the Mexican border.The president described a frank exchange with Mr. Perry, who has been one of his most vocal critics, after their private meeting aboard the presidential helicopter and then at Dallas Love Field.The meeting was hastily negotiated as the border crisis came to shadow Mr. Obama\u2019s previously planned trip to Texas and Colorado to raise campaign money and talk about an improving economy.The president said the emergency aid would address Republicans\u2019 calls for increased border security while also providing care for the thousands of unaccompanied children who have been detained in the Rio Grande Valley. Mr. Obama suggested that election-year political maneuvering was blocking the package because Republicans see the crisis as a way to damage him and his party.\u201cThe problem here is not major disagreement around the actions that could be helpful,\u201d Mr. Obama said he told Mr. Perry. \u201cThe challenge is, is Congress prepared to act to put the resources in place to get this done?\u201d\u201cAnother way of putting it \u2014 and I said this directly to the governor \u2014 is, are folks more interested in politics, or are they more interested in solving the problem?\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Perry, in a statement after his meeting with the president, reiterated that the crisis was the result of \u201cbad public policy,\u201d though he did not specify \u2014 as he has in the past \u2014 that Mr. Obama\u2019s policies were to blame. He also again asked Mr. Obama to visit the border, about 500 miles south of Dallas, a call that Mr. Obama rejected on Wednesday.\u201cThis isn\u2019t theater; this is a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in photo-ops. I\u2019m interested in solving a problem.\u201dMr. Obama promised to \u201cdo the right thing by these children.\u201d But he also urged parents in Central America to stop sending their children into the United States, a trip he called especially dangerous.\u201cIt is unlikely that their children will be able to stay,\u201d Mr. Obama said. More than 52,000 children have flooded into the United States in the last eight months.Mr. Obama\u2019s arrival in Texas, the state with the longest border with Mexico, focused attention on the emerging spike in migration from Central America as well as the political stalemate between the president and his Republican adversaries on a broader immigration overhaul.The president and Mr. Perry met before a round-table discussion on the border issue with local officials and religious leaders.The governor, who had initially refused to stand for an Air Force One photo opportunity with the president, ultimately did greet Mr. Obama on the tarmac at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The pair shook hands amiably if not warmly, and they chatted as they walked to the Marine One helicopter for a brief ride to the Love Field site of the round-table discussion, with Mr. Obama at one point putting his hand on the governor\u2019s back.Mr. Obama said his Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, would soon make his sixth trip to the border to coordinate the federal response with that of the Perry administration. Jim Cole, the deputy attorney general, was in the border town of McAllen, Tex., on Wednesday to tour the Customs and Border Protection facility there and to discuss shifting resources to the region.Mr. Perry\u2019s handling of the crisis is being closely watched by Republicans, given that his 2012 bid for the party\u2019s presidential nomination failed partly because of a sense among the party\u2019s hard-liners that he was too soft on immigration, supporting policies like tuition benefits for Latinos brought into Texas as children.Signaling a tougher stance, he has called on Mr. Obama to deploy 1,000 more National Guard troops to the border and use additional surveillance drones to stop the flow of illegal immigrants. Mr. Obama indicated that he had not ruled out such measures, but that they ultimately were not the answer.\u201cWe\u2019re happy to consider how we could deploy National Guard down there, but that\u2019s a temporary solution,\u201d he said. The long-term answer, Mr. Obama said, would be to pass a year-old bipartisan Senate bill overhauling the immigration system and providing more border security and a path to citizenship for millions who have lived and worked in the country illegally for years.In Washington, congressional Republicans expressed both frustration and skepticism about Mr. Obama\u2019s aid request, and members of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration told Congress that they were straining under what one called the \u201cdifficult and distressing\u201d surge of unaccompanied minors across the border.Testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, W. Craig Fugate, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that \u201cthe children continue to come across the border\u201d despite the government\u2019s best efforts.Congressional Republicans are left with a dilemma. Their goals are to increase the federal presence on the border and address what they agree is a humanitarian crisis, but they do not want to accomplish them by giving Mr. Obama $3.7 billion that would help get him out of a situation that they believe is of his own making.\u201cWhat I do think this shows is another area where lack of leadership from this administration is coming back to haunt us,\u201d said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida.At the root of the crisis is a 2008 law intended to curb human trafficking abuses. It requires officials to provide extra legal protections for migrants coming from countries that do not share a border with the United States. The unintended consequence has been to allow children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to overwhelm the immigration system. Some Republicans have said that before they would vote in favor of Mr. Obama\u2019s request, they would need to see the 2008 law amended or repealed to expedite the children\u2019s return to their home countries. Some also said they wanted the relief spending to be matched by cuts in other areas.Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, said he was working with the state\u2019s senior senator, John Cornyn, to introduce legislation in the near future that would amend the 2008 law to treat illegal immigrants from such countries by the same rules that currently apply to Mexico and Canada. The change, he said, would speed up deportations.On the Democratic side, Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, and Dianne Feinstein of California, have expressed deep reservations about sending the children back to potentially dangerous situations. \u201cI think we\u2019d better think twice,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. Ms. Feinstein likened the situation to the \u201cboatloads of Jewish immigrants trying to come to this country during Nazi Germany and getting turned back.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what this country is all about,\u201d she said. \u201cThis, in my view, has to be handled in a way which is compassionate.\u201dThe American Civil Liberties Union and the American Immigration Council also stepped in on Wednesday, filing a class-action lawsuit in Seattle on behalf of the children. The suit argues that the federal government is failing to provide them with adequate legal representation during the deportation process.Jackie Calmes reported from Dallas, and Ashley Parker from Washington. Michael D. Shear, Jeremy W. Peters and Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lawyer\u2019s Apprentice", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Chris Tittle meets new people and the topic turns to his work, he sometimes fishes in his pockets and produces a business card that reads \u201cAbraham Lincoln.\u201d Below the 16th president\u2019s name in smaller type the card reads, \u201cJust kidding, but I hope to follow in some of his footsteps.\u201dMr. Tittle, who sports the kind of full beard more often associated with folk-rock bands than future junior partners, is working toward becoming a lawyer under an obscure California rule that allows people to \u201cread law\u201d much as Lincoln did, studying at the elbow of a seasoned lawyer.\u201cThere is very little that would entice me to go $100,000 or more into debt for a credential,\u201d said Mr. Tittle, who is in his first year of a four-year program of practical study.To Ms. Orsi, a graduate of the highly ranked Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, apprenticeships are a way to reorder the economics of law school and law work. Without loans to pay back, she argues, lawyers won\u2019t have to chase big paychecks or prestige with corporate clients and could instead work in nonprofit, environmental and community law.\u201cAttorneys trained in this way will be able to be average people,\u201d Ms. Orsi said, \u201cnot just because they don\u2019t have debt, but because law school tells us that we\u2019re really special.\u201dMs. Orsi and the cohort of \u201capprenti,\u201d as they jokingly refer to themselves, hope their experience will serve as a model for other nonprofit organizations to cultivate their own lawyers. \u201cThe mission is not to create more lawyers,\u201d said Ms. Orsi. \u201cIt\u2019s to serve the community.\u201dBefore the prevalence of law schools in the 1870s, apprenticeships were the primary way to become a lawyer. \u201cStop and think of some of the great lawyers in American history,\u201d said Daniel R. Coquillette, a law professor at Boston College who teaches and writes in the areas of legal history and professional responsibility. \u201cJohn Adams, Chief Justice Marshall, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. They didn\u2019t go to law school at all.\u201dThe earliest law schools, Mr. Coquillette said, worked in tandem with apprenticeships, a practice he noted is returning as many law schools move toward externships for third-year students.But there are obstacles. None of the states help prospective law readers locate a supervising lawyer, and finding one willing to take on the responsibility of educating a new lawyer can be difficult. Bar passage rates for law office students are also dismal. Last year only 17 passed \u2014 or 28 percent, compared with 73 percent for students who attended schools approved by the American Bar Association.\u201cThe A.B.A. takes the position that the most appropriate process for becoming a lawyer should include obtaining a J.D. degree from a law school approved by the A.B.A. and passing a bar examination,\u201d said Barry A. Currier, managing director of accreditation and legal education for the group.Robert E. Glenn, president of the Virginia Board of Bar Examiners, was less circumspect. \u201cIt\u2019s a cruel hoax,\u201d he said of apprenticeships. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste of time for someone to spend three years in this program but not have anything at the end.\u201dOne former apprentice, speaking on the condition of anonymity, dropped out after her third year of study. The stumbling block, she said, was the first-year exam, the so-called baby bar required of all those in California who study outside of law schools accredited by the A.B.A or state\u2019s Committee of Bar Examiners.\u201cIt was the writing,\u201d she said. After two attempts and stumped by legalese, she decided law might not be her path. \u201cI\u2019m over it now, but it was disappointing that I couldn\u2019t pass it,\u201d she said. Still, she doesn\u2019t regret her apprenticeship \u2014 the lessons, she says, have been useful in her current work in state government.Isabell Wong Flores knows well the feeling of bar exam defeat. After completing her law office study, it took five attempts over two and a half years before she passed the bar exam. \u201cThere were times when I wanted to give up so much,\u201d said Ms. Flores, now a Sacramento criminal defense lawyer who draws on her perseverance in her side work as a motivational speaker. The exam is torturous, she said, but \u201cyou have to find ways to conquer it.\u201d Ms. Flores bought study tapes and enrolled in bar prep courses at local law schools before passing in 2007 \u2014 seven years after starting down this road. \u201cI wanted to give myself an education,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took a little longer than I thought it would.\u201dThe lack of a J.D. can also be cause for concern to clients.For most, the lack of class rankings put clerkships with judges and plum gigs at big firms out of reach. There are exceptions: Jeffrey L. Smoot, a law reader, was recently made partner at one of Seattle\u2019s oldest firms, Oles Morrison Rinker & Baker. \u201cIt\u2019s a validation of the program,\u201d he said.Washington\u2019s program for apprentices \u2014 called law clerks there \u2014 stands out for the extent of support from the state bar association. A volunteer board sets study standards and assigns a liaison to each lawyer-apprentice duo to monitor their progress. Students must also be employed by the office in which they study. Of law clerks who took the Washington bar last year, 67 percent passed.Talia Clever, who coordinates the program for the state bar, says she routinely fields calls from people who want to know how hard it is to become a lawyer without law school. Her answer: very. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work. It\u2019s four years and you don\u2019t get summers off. You\u2019re on the line working with a lawyer every day.\u201dFor some, that\u2019s the appeal. Instead of spending years in lecture halls, time is spent in courtrooms or with clients \u2014 experience most traditional law school students might only get during a semester of clinical practice. For paralegals, the method makes it possible to hold down a job or keep paying off a mortgage while earning an advanced credential. \u201cI didn\u2019t just want to up and quit my job and go to law school and become a student again,\u201d said Megumi C. Hackett, a paralegal in Vancouver, Wash., who is studying under the tutelage of Jon J. McMullen, a criminal defense lawyer.\u201cIt has been a hell of a lot of work,\u201d said Mr. McMullen of his new role as teacher. \u201cI\u2019ve had to reacquaint myself with stuff I wish to God I didn\u2019t have to think about again.\u201d Rules vary from state to state, but supervising lawyers are expected to instruct their students in all areas of law covered by their state\u2019s bar exam, and administer and grade tests.\u201cIt does take a lot of time and effort,\u201d said D.R. Dansby, the Virginia lawyer supervising Mr. Fehrenbach. Mr. Dansby, who read law in the late 1970s, has mentored three lawyers through the state\u2019s program, each passing the bar on the first attempt.Most supervisors just want to give back. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d Mr. Dansby said. \u201cWe have plenty of lawyers, but not enough good ones.\u201d But make no mistake, he stressed, these programs are not for everyone. He has turned away nearly two dozen people who he didn\u2019t think had the motivation to take on a readership. An added deterrent is that Virginia strictly forbids employing, and paying, apprentices.Robert Galbraith took a leave from the University at Buffalo Law School with hopes of completing his education by clerking while working full time for a local nonprofit. He knocked on a dozen doors, all with the same answer: no. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to find people who even know it exists,\u201d said Mr. Galbraith, referring to the New York rule that permits law-office study after the successful completion of one year of law school. Mr. Galbraith headed back to law school part time but didn\u2019t finish in the five years mandated by the New York Bar Examiners. He now works for a watchdog group, the Public Accountability Initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s very stimulating and engaging work,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if an opportunity arises to clerk at a law office in order to take the bar, I would consider it.\u201dLooking to the future, Ms. Orsi hopes that her current students will take on apprentices of their own someday, and that law office study will gain recognition as a viable alternative.\u201cI hope,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople will have a more creative outlook toward legal education.\u201dAn article on Page 22 this weekend about law apprenticeships misspells the given name of a founder of the United Farm Workers union, which has trained lawyers through apprenticeships. She is Dolores Huerta, not Delores.An article last Sunday about law apprenticeships referred incompletely to exemptions from California\u2019s first-year law exam.

But he has often been quick to take responsibility.\u201cUltimately I\u2019m responsible. I\u2019m the president of the United States. We\u2019ve got a big mess that we\u2019re having to clean up.

For ultimately, the buck stops with me.\u201d\u201cWell, here\u2019s what I remember, is that when I came into office, I knew I was going to have a big mess to clean up and, frankly, the mess has been bigger than I think a lot of people anticipated at the time. We have made steady progress on these fronts, but we\u2019re not making progress fast enough.\u201cAnd what I continue to believe is that ultimately the buck stops with me. I\u2019m going to be accountable. I think people understand that a lot of these problems were decades in the making. People understand that this financial crisis was the worst since the Great Depression. But, ultimately, they say, look, he\u2019s the president, we think he has good intentions, but we\u2019re impatient and we want to see things move faster.\u201d\u201cWell, here\u2019s what I know, we were just talking about responsibility, and as president of the United States, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that I\u2019m responsible for folks who are working in the federal government and, you know, Harry Truman said the buck stops with you.\u201d\u201cWell, look, ultimately, the buck stops with me.

This is the anti-George W. Bush. The fess-upper in chief. He is the antidote to the eight previous years of obfuscation, fault-dodging and flat-out denial.This is one of the traits that made Obama an attractive candidate, and it is one of his best traits as a president.But taking his share of responsibility does not mean he must acquiesce to his opponents and absolve them of guilt, particularly not an intransigent Congress that would rather do nothing than something, particularly not Republican leaders who envision opportunity in opposition. The president has a duty to himself and the country to call them out for the part they play in our problems. The real question, Mr. Boehner, is not when the president will take personal responsibility for something. He has. Many times. The real question is, When will you?Advertisement"}

Even if those dresses are more mishmashes, like the striking one assembled by Abigail Matses, 21, an intern in the home d\u00e9cor department of Good Housekeeping magazine who was en route to meet friends at the Madison Avenue Sant Ambroeus restaurant on a recent sun-dappled Friday afternoon.Ms. Matses was wearing a long, stiff pink sateen skirt that ballooned slightly at the waist, into which was tucked a cross-hatched shirt. This she accessorized with glittery pointed flats that suggested Dorothy Gale\u2019s silver shoes (in L. Frank Baum\u2019s \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\u201d not the George Cukor movie version), a jumble of golden charms around her neck and, for a purse, a vintage rattan lightship basket festooned with a seashell.\u201cI\u2019m overdressed all the time,\u201d she said.In that she is an exception. As carefully groomed personal expression reaches an all-time high online, the main fashion trend visible on the streets of Manhattan this summer has been unstudied casualness, almost as if real life has become just a liminal place to get through before the next occasion of virtual self-display.14 PhotosThere is also, of course, the continued queasy economy, the rise of bicycling, the increase of ladies who lunch at their desks and the surge of the thermometer. Dare one call it much-too-warmcore?In the old paradigm, girls in their summer dresses floated along, carefree and unencumbered, perhaps balancing the string of a hatbox between thumb and forefinger. But a half-dozen examples stopped on Madison Avenue were laden with overstuffed satchels, often in multiple.Farah Abad, 39, of Jackson Heights, Queens, had one for her gym togs and one, by Balenciaga, filled with papers pertaining to her job as the private-events director for Jean-Georges Management. Her dress, simple and black with a large flower splashed down the front, was from Mango.Giulia Zuanni, 33, an actress from Verona, Italy, who has been staying on the Upper West Side, was lugging a blue backpack frame and a leather handbag into which she could easily fit her Toto, a Maltese/poodle named Paradiso who coordinated with her cream-colored sundress.\u201cThey like it when it matches my dog,\u201d she said dryly of her outfit, referring to male admirers. On Ms. Zuanni\u2019s feet, as if to outrun these men like Atalanta, were pink-swooshed Nikes.This combination was in sync with selling patterns observed at Intermix, the chain of boutiques headquartered in the Flatiron district, by Khajak Keledjian, its chief executive. Mr. Keledjian said he was selling lots of boyish shoes such as sneakers (albeit ones by Valentino) that cut the sweetness of long, flowing fabrics.\u201cThey say, \u2018Ugly is the new pretty,\u2019 in this business,\u201d Mr. Keledjian said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018What are you thinking?\u2019 And then it\u2019s so cute.\u201dDoing even better than dresses, he added, were monochromatic shirts and skirts in different patterns, along with combinations of crop tops, boyfriend sweaters and shorts.\u201cWe don\u2019t like anything matchy-matchy,\u201d he said.And Generation Etsy would seem to agree.

Playing your mom at 14? Yikes! So it\u2019s all the more remarkable that Mona Golabek, who is undertaking this feat in \u201cThe Pianist of Willesden Lane,\u201d seems to slip so effortlessly into the persona of her mother, the pianist Lisa Jura, during her tumultuous adolescence in Vienna and London.For Ms. Golabek is not a trained actress, but a concert pianist herself. In this deeply affecting memoir-once-removed, adapted and directed by Hershey Felder, and based on a book by Ms. Golabek and Lee Cohen, Ms. Golabek tells the story of her mother\u2019s youth during World War II in her mother\u2019s voice. Underpinning the story are selections from the classical piano repertoire \u2014 Bach and Beethoven, Chopin and Rachmaninoff \u2014 which Ms. Golabek performs on the Steinway grand piano that gleams on a gilt-edged platform at center stage and is her sole co-star.But this week the lesson will not take place. After Lisa makes it past the German soldier with the rifle at the front door, her beloved instructor tells her he has been forbidden to teach Jewish students. \u201cI\u2019m not a brave man,\u201d he says, and bids her goodbye.But the windfall purchases only one seat \u2014 and Lisa has two sisters. They will be left behind as she sets out for London, where her father\u2019s cousin has agreed to take her in. Yet when she arrives, there is more disappointment: The family has to leave London and does not have room in its new home to take Lisa with them. Eventually she ends up at a group home for children of the kindertransport, run with loving sternness by a Mrs. Cohen, on the street that gives the play its title.The musical selections are mostly classical favorites: Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight\u201d Sonata, Debussy\u2019s \u201cClair de Lune,\u201d Rachmaninoff\u2019s Prelude in C sharp minor, representing the standard repertoire that a young woman of Lisa\u2019s age and background would have learned. The story takes a romantic turn when Lisa begins earning a living by playing the piano at a hotel frequented by soldiers, and finds herself wooed by several. Here the music turns briefly to standards: a slow-tempoed \u201cStrike Up the Band\u201d and \u201cThese Foolish Things.\u201d The story of Lisa\u2019s life in London has both dark passages, as the war cuts off communication from Europe, and all the children at the home lose track of their families, and moments of unexpected joy. Throughout, the bedrock of Lisa\u2019s emotional support remains her almost desperate love of music, which sustains her in the face of calamity, confusion, loss. \u201cNever stop playing,\u201d her mother told her just before she boarded the train in Vienna, \u201cand I will be with you every step of the way.\u201d Lisa took the words to heart. Spiritually speaking, her fingers never left the keys, because only through her music could she maintain a connection to the vanished happiness of her Vienna childhood and the love of the family she feared lost forever.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Bulgaria, Corruption and Mistrust Turn Promise Into Pain", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 The lines of panicked depositors in this threadbare capital evaporated as quickly as they appeared in what may have been the shortest banking crisis in history \u2014 or potentially the prelude to something more tumultuous.In a city where conspiracy theories are as common as kebab stands, residents have various notions about what caused sudden runs last month on two of Bulgaria\u2019s largest banks.Was it the result of a dispute involving two politically connected businessmen? A plot by foreign agents as revenge for Bulgaria\u2019s suspending construction of a pipeline meant to carry Russian natural gas? Something else? All of the above?Whatever the reason, the runs on Corporate Commercial Bank, or K.T.B., and First Investment Bank, or F.I.B., have focused new attention on the fragile economy and dysfunctional politics that are hobbling Bulgaria.While Bulgaria seemed to have much promise when it joined the European Union in 2007, it remains the bloc\u2019s poorest country. Bulgaria has a per capita gross domestic product equivalent to $16,300 \u2014 less than half the European average. The government has been accused of mismanaging the economy to the point where the European Union has frozen billions of euros in aid.Moscow\u2019s displeasure with Bulgaria\u2019s recent decision, under European Union pressure, to suspend work on the South Stream pipeline, which would transport gas across the Black Sea, has raised concerns about more tension in a region already rattled by the Ukraine crisis. On Monday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, was in Sofia to discuss the pipeline.For many here, Bulgaria\u2019s problems stem from ties between some businesspeople and the increasingly unpopular Socialist-led government of Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski, who took office little more than a year ago but has agreed to hold early elections on Oct. 5. The current government is expected to resign by the end of the month, and an interim cabinet will preside until the new government is elected.The bank runs only deepened the disillusionment among foreign investors and within the multinational business community. And they shook confidence in the ability of the Bulgarian National Bank \u2014 the central bank \u2014 to supervise the country\u2019s financial system and called into question its status as one of the few government institutions that functioned reasonably well.While both K.T.B. and F.I.B. are Bulgarian-owned, F.I.B. kept its doors open after assurances of support from the government. K.T.B. has not yet reopened.\u201cOur banking system, they say, is one of the most stable in Europe,\u201d Ivailo Stefanov, a 36-year-old construction engineer, said as he left an F.I.B. branch in Sofia last week. \u201cWell, if you can shake up such a stable system in two weeks, what does that say about how stable everything else is?\u201dWith an educated middle class and attractions including Black Sea beaches and Balkan peaks, Bulgaria was once a magnet for foreign companies.But outside investment, which totaled more than $9 billion in 2009, fell to an estimated $1.4 billion last year. Corruption and erratic government policy \u2014 chronic problems since the fall of Communism \u2014 as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid debts to American- and European-owned electricity producers, have hurt the business climate.\u201cCorruption eats the country,\u201d said David Varod, chief executive of Nu Boyana Film Studios, an American-owned complex on the outskirts of Sofia.Nu Boyana illustrates Bulgaria\u2019s potential and the hazards of doing business here. After buying the former government film studio in 2006 on behalf of Nu Image, a Los Angeles film producer, Mr. Varod, who is Israeli, invested $50 million to repair the derelict facility, which includes a trove of medieval and modern weapons and, outdoors, a huge mock-up of an ancient Roman city.After the American acquisition, Nu Boyana\u2019s work force grew from barely 100 to 2,000 \u2014 as many as 3,000 during peak times \u2014 according to Mr. Varod. Last year, \u201cThe Expendables 3,\u201d starring Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, was primarily shot there.But in an interview last week, Mr. Varod complained about the government \u2014 including a bureaucracy that he said made it difficult to obtain visas for visiting actors and crew to stay longer than three months.The company had a few million dollars on deposit in K.T.B. and had long worked with it and other local banks, he said. \u201cThere was no reason not to trust them.\u201dBranches of K.T.B. remained closed last week, as the bank tried to sort out its problems under emergency supervision by the Bulgarian central bank. At the main office, in central Sofia, a sign taped to the locked door was meant to assure customers that their money was safe, though it also said they would not have access to it until the bank reopened on July 21.The mystery is how the bank run, which later spread to F.I.B., happened in the first place.The generally accepted account is that the panic sprang from a dispute between Delyan Peevski, a media mogul who is also a member of Parliament, and his former business partner, the financier Tsvetan Vassilev. After the two had a falling-out, the story goes, Mr. Peevski withdrew his money from K.T.B., which was controlled by Mr. Vassilev.Both men declined requests to comment for this article.Spurred by reports in the media, depositors, apparently including a large number of corporate customers and state-owned companies, joined the stampede. An estimated $950 million \u2014 about a fifth of the bank\u2019s assets \u2014 was withdrawn from K.T.B. before it came under central-bank supervision on June 20.The panic then spread to F.I.B. On June 27, customers withdrew about $550 million from the bank after rumors appeared on social media and in text messages. The government arrested at least seven people suspected of spending text messages warning that the bank was about to collapse. Officials of the Bulgarian central bank and the two commercial banks declined requests for comment.Overseas investors are wary.Alex Nestor, vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Bulgaria, said, \u201cThe investment climate in the country is not something we can be proud of.\u201dThe country\u2019s energy industry is a prime example.Much of Bulgaria\u2019s electricity is produced by foreign companies, which sell power to the state-owned utility. The AES Corporation, which is based in Arlington, Va., has invested $2 billion in Bulgaria.But populist parties, which have long dominated Bulgarian politics, imposed price cuts that energy companies said pressed the price of electricity below the cost of its production. In addition, the government-owned electricity supplier owes the generating companies roughly $500 million in unpaid fees, according to people in the industry.The disenchantment is not limited to foreign companies.Atanas Kiryakov is the chief executive of Ontotext, a company that makes software for online publishing. Ontotext\u2019s customers include the British Broadcasting Corporation, and it has offices in the United States and Britain.Mr. Kiryakov joined large protests in Sofia last year after the government tried to appoint Mr. Peevski, the media tycoon, to lead the national security agency.\u201cIt was like appointing Rupert Murdoch head of MI6,\u201d Mr. Kiryakov said, referring to the British intelligence service.But he and other Bulgarians say they will be surprised if the next government is much better. The center-right party Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria \u2014 led by Boiko Borisov, a former prime minister \u2014 is leading in the polls. The party made little progress in ending corruption and improving economic performance from 2009 to 2013, when it held power.\u201cWe are a young democracy,\u201d Mr. Kiryakov said. Despite the country\u2019s middle class, \u201cwe have a large number of people who are not well educated, who are easy to manipulate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever this is the case, you will always have people who will try to exploit this phenomenon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawmakers Voice Skepticism on Iran Nuclear Deal", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration officials engaged in nuclear negotiations with Iran ran into a wall of skepticism at two congressional hearings on Tuesday, with members of both parties insisting on a vote on any final agreement with the Tehran government and administration officials strongly hinting that they have little intention of complying.Yet Ms. Sherman also acknowledged that Iran has revealed few details of its suspected efforts to design a weapon to international inspectors, and she was vague on the question of how much Iran\u2019s capacity to enrich uranium would have to be degraded before a deal was considered acceptable.But the sharpest differences emerged on the question of who would get the final say on what an agreement would look like: President Obama or Congress. The testiness was part of the running battle in Washington over Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to bypass Congress on a range of issues, from immigration to climate change, and his insistence, similar to the administration of George W. Bush, that the president has the power to manage foreign affairs with minimal congressional consultation.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t seek congressional legislation in any comprehensive agreement for years,\u201d one senior administration official said recently, speaking with a clarity that Ms. Sherman avoided as she tried to appease suspicious and angry members of Congress. \u201cThe early suspensions would be executive action,\u201d the official said.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.Ms. Sherman tried to bridge the gap by offering assurances that if Mr. Obama acts unilaterally to neutralize any sanctions by executive order, \u201cwe will not do so without conversations with Congress.\u201dSenator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who has been a consistent critic of the Obama administration\u2019s negotiations, countered that until now, \u201cthe conversations have been, \u2018This is what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a very unsatisfactory place for us to be,\u201d he said.Other members wanted the agreement to encompass issues that were not included in the negotiations between Iran, the United States and five American partners: Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. Some insisted on limits on Iran\u2019s missile capability. Others talked about stopping Iran from providing rockets to Hamas, which Ms. Sherman quickly acknowledged was the source of much of Hamas\u2019s firepower in its rocket attacks on Israel.Asked whether he could assure Congress that the more than $2 billion in assets held outside the United States that Iran will have access to under the extension agreement would not be used to aid Hamas, David S. Cohen, the under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said he could not \u201cgive you that guarantee.\u201d But Mr. Cohen insisted that the sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe had been so effective that Iran\u2019s economy was 25 percent smaller than it should be.Administration officials faced their most difficult time describing the long-term end game for the Iranian nuclear program.Mr. Zarif, the Iranian negotiator, talked in his interview about an Iran that puts up with restrictions for a set number of years, then is permitted to build as large an industrial-scale nuclear infrastructure as it likes \u2014 much as Japan or South Korea does. Ms. Sherman avoided discussing, at least in open session, the American strategy for dealing with that Iranian demand, but the reality is that any agreement will have time limits, and when they expire Iran will find itself with few commitments, other than to allow inspections.The other issue officials danced around during the hearings of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was what would constitute an acceptable \u201cbreakout\u201d time for Iran \u2014 the amount of time it would need to produce enough fuel for one nuclear weapon. Right now, Ms. Sherman said, citing nongovernment, unclassified estimates, breakout time is about two months. Secretary of State John Kerry said this year that he would like to see that extended to a year or more.Ms. Sherman was less specific, but said that the current breakout time did not create enough warning for the United States and Israel, among others, and must be lengthened.An article on Wednesday about demands among both parties in Congress that the Obama administration allow a vote on any agreement with Iran on its nuclear weapons program misstated, in some editions, the value of assets that Iran will have access to under an agreement. It is more than $2 billion, not more than $2 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Utopian Citizens Like to Leave the House", "Date": "2014-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewAndre Komatsu\u2019s \u201cBase Hier\u00e1rquica,\u201d foreground, is part of \u201cBeyond the Supersquare,\u201d a new exhibition at the Bronx Museum of the Arts that looks back at 20th-century modernism in South America. An untitled work by Carlos Bunga is in the background.In the mid-20th century, certain Latin American cities looked like the most modern on earth. Not only was their architecture imaginative, but so was the thinking behind it: ideas, amounting to faith, that design could positively shape civic life across lines of money and class; that art and architecture were inseparable; that while Europe and the United States were the cultural powers of the day, South America had a shot at tomorrow.Then the momentum broke. In the 1960s and \u201870s, a rash of right-wing military coups swept the continent. Left-leaning utopianism was suppressed, and the architecture it had produced either abandoned or repurposed to new political ends. With such changes, modernist monuments to the future became, to some eyes, relics of a lost past, emblems of dreams betrayed and grim landmarks of a present that had to be survived.One thing that didn\u2019t change was the old link between architecture and art, though the two disciplines now often assumed an adversarial relationship. Art became a way for artists, many of them originally trained as architects, to talk critically about modernist architecture and the failings it represented. This dynamic continues into the postmodern present and is the subject of a subtle and elusive think-piece of an exhibition called \u201cBeyond the Supersquare,\u201d at the Bronx Museum of the Arts.The show emerged from an academic conference, convened by the museum in 2011, on the conflicted legacy of modernism in South America and the Caribbean. And more than a few of the 60 pieces seem, on first encounter, to require the logic of a lecture format to make full sense. But the show is blessed with an airy, effortless installation by Benedeta Monteverde, a designer from Mexico City, and has enough instantly recognizable images to get you moving.The \u201csupersquare\u201d of the title is a reference to Brasilia, the space age city par excellence designed by Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012) and built between 1956 and 1960 as Brazil\u2019s new political capital. Among its innovative features were giant apartment blocks \u2014 \u201csuperquadras\u201d \u2014 conceived as self-sufficient communities. Replete with shops, gyms, libraries and other amenities, they were designed to ensure that residents, mostly civil employees, never had to leave home.But, of course, people like to leave home, and shop here and there, so the somewhat forced communalism that Niemeyer, a lifelong socialist, had envisioned quickly fell apart. Then, four years after the city\u2019s debut, a military dictator came to power, Niemeyer left for Europe, and Brasilia\u2019s bright moment was over.We see its image several times in the exhibition, organized by Holly Block, executive director of the Bronx Museum, and Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, an independent curator, through skeptical contemporary eyes. A few years ago, the Colombian artist Alberto Baraya photographed Brasilia\u2019s signature buildings and included in each frame the image of his own hand holding up a flower \u2014 not in tribute to Brasilia but as a memorial gesture to the landscape that had been destroyed to create it.In 2012, when the photographer Mauro Restiffe shot the city during Niemeyer\u2019s funeral, he made its slablike structures look like tombstones and its government workers like spies.Felipe Arturo, trained as an architect in Colombia, contributes a cast-concrete model of another modernist paragon, Le Corbusier\u2019s \u201cLa Maison Domino\u201d (1914-15), a simple structure of stacked planes and uprights designed to be cheaply and easily replicated, erected and attached to similar structures to create mass-produced housing. Although Corbusier never put the project into action, its basic formula is found throughout the so-called Third World. We see a surreal version of the project in an astonishing aerial photograph by Livia Corona Benjamin documenting tens of thousands of attached look-alike houses erected in the last 15 years in a development near Mexico City. A video by Jordi Colomer takes us, at ground level, through the color-coded streets and gives heartening evidence that the development\u2019s residents, however they feel about living in so faceless a place, are at least inventively customizing their homes.A prototype for Corbusier\u2019s ideal of an ad hoc, anyone-can-do-it architecture has long existed in the urban favelas of Latin America, impoverished districts in which habitable spaces organically accumulate and are always simultaneously piling up and falling down. There are few pictures of favelas in this show, which steers studiously clear of the kind of misery-images by which South America, like Africa, is popularly represented. But they are represented obliquely, and we get repeated examples of structures presented in a state of what might be called postmodern contingency.A plain image in a two-minute video by Alexander Ap\u00f3stol packs an entire history of exploitation. During the Venezuelan oil boom of the 1950s, rural workers moved to Caracas with the assurance that they\u2019d find housing in newly planned modern-style projects. While waiting for the housing to go up, they took shelter in hovels, which their descendants are still in. In the video, an older man and two young children, probably his grandchildren, sit in a dumpy room watching old films of the Venezuelan economic revolution on television.And there\u2019s work that doesn\u2019t just comment on architecture but also does something to it, alters it. Through collage and watercolor, Maria Martinez-Ca\u00f1as and Rafael Domenech transform found photographs of World War II military bunkers into porous, decorative structures. Ishmael Randall-Weeks lifts architectural images from a range of sources, cuts them up and arranges the pieces into fractured, hybrid structures just wild-enough-looking to be plausible.Whether we\u2019re meant to take the results as hopeful is left in doubt, but that\u2019s true in a lot of what\u2019s here. How do we respond to the photos of hotels, apartment buildings and storefronts flashing by in a video called \u201cUseless Landscapes,\u201d by the Mexican artist Pablo L\u00f3n de la Barra, who is also the curator of the current exhibition \u201cUnder the Same Sun: Art From Latin America Today\u201d at the Guggenheim Museum? Are we seeing an architecture in a process of deliquescence or one staying alive, despite hard politics and harsh economies, with a certain resilient grace?There are different ways of questioning modernism. You can attack outright or you can tease it, as Felipe Dulzaides does in the installation \u201cInterrogating Architecture,\u201d which consists of a drafting table, a floor-plan drawing of the National School of Dance in Havana and two microphones. The school\u2019s building was started in the 1960s but never finished, and Mr. Dulzaides has a problem with that. The two mikes seem to be asking the drawing to explain itself: \u201cWhy the delay?\u201dAnother Cuban, Carlos Garaicoa, an architect by training, maps out the history of his home city (also Havana), now decrepit, and fantasizes future changes (a pier that runs from the harbor to Key West) in a charming pop-up book. Fernanda Fragateiro displays the dust jacket of the catalog from the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s 1955 exhibition \u201cLatin American Architecture Since 1945,\u201d hanging open over a piece of acrylic as if she were airing it out after years of its moldering on the shelf. (An update to that show, \u201cLatin Construction: Architecture 1955-1980,\u201d is scheduled at MoMA for 2015.)So, yes, modernism is a loaded, tainted subject, in different ways in different cultures. How can it be fruitfully revisited? Leonor Antunes\u2019s answer was to design a kind of indoor pavilion-shrine dedicated to two of Latin America\u2019s great \u00e9migr\u00e9 artists: the architect Lina Bo Bardi, who was born in Italy in 1914 and died in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1992, and the sculptor Gego, who was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912 and died in Caracas in 1994. Both are figures from whom we have everything to learn.The Canadian artist Terence Gower, who works frequently in Mexico, takes Ms. Antunes\u2019s architectural image a step further by giving it a practical use. On commission from the Bronx Museum, he has built an open-air pavilion in the lush garden of the Andrew Freedman Home, a palatial former retirement residence across Grand Concourse from the museum. His historical model is Marcel Breuer\u2019s \u201cHouse in the Museum Garden,\u201d which was temporarily installed in MoMA\u2019s garden in 1949. His contemporary inspiration is the puesto, a type of collapsible, portable market stand found throughout Latin America.Mr. Gower\u2019s version, called \u201cSuperPuesto\u201d and made of plain wood and tarpaulin stained in Mondrian colors (red, yellow and blue), doesn\u2019t look like much by itself. But it\u2019s clean-lined and flexible, which are modernist formal ideals, and impermanent and popularly available, which move it into some other, maybe postmodern realm. It\u2019s there strictly for neighborhood use \u2014 for classes, dances, weddings, concerts, picnics, play groups, lectures. It comes to life only when people are added, filling it, changing it, making it their own until it disappears in the fall.An art review on July 25 about \u201cBeyond the Supersquare,\u201d at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, misidentified the owner of the Andrew Freedman home, across Grand Concourse from the museum, where the artist Terence Gower has built an open-air pavilion in the garden. It is the Mid-Bronx Senior Citizens Council, not New York City.\u201cBeyond the Supersquare\u201d continues through Jan. 11 at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania; 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org.

{"Headline": "Emergency Starter and Hot Bats Lift Yankees to Satisfying Victory", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYankees 5, Indians 3CLEVELAND \u2014 There could have been ways that Monday\u2019s game unfolded better for the Yankees. Maybe their emergency pitcher, making his first career start, could have lasted seven innings instead of six. Or their $85 million catcher, mired in a four-month slump, could have laced four hits instead of just three. Or maybe their lineup could have chased the Cleveland Indians\u2019 starter in the second inning and not the third.\u201cWe\u2019ve said all along this kid has a lot of talent,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just figuring out what makes you successful and how you have to pitch. I don\u2019t think he tried to do too much, and I think that\u2019s pretty impressive, too.\u201d As were the diversified contributions from an offense that had just pummeled Twins pitching for 22 runs in the Yankees\u2019 three victories in Minnesota, with five players driving in runs, and three \u2014 Brian McCann, Ichiro Suzuki and Brett Gardner \u2014 chipping in with three hits each. The day\u2019s lone deflating development, it seemed, involved Carlos Beltran, who was held out of the lineup after twisting his right knee during his final at-bat Sunday. Beltran said after the game that he felt discomfort behind the knee, in his hamstring tendon, but that he was hopeful he could rejoin the lineup no later than Wednesday and bolster a bench shortened by the presence of an extra reliever to support a taxed bullpen. Greene\u2019s responsibility Monday, in not so many words, was not to add to those troubles. The Yankees hoped for length and competence and, given the recent struggles of the rookie Chase Whitley (a 14.81 earned run average in his last three outings), maybe even a reason to consider awarding him another start. Yes, yes and yes, though not much about Greene\u2019s brief appearance against the Red Sox on April 24 portended his efficiency on Monday. That night he walked three of the five Boston hitters he faced and was sent down two days later to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where he remained until the Yankees dealt Monday\u2019s original scheduled starter, Vidal Nuno, to Arizona on Sunday. In the minors, Greene worked on his control and his confidence, and on commanding his power sinker down in the strike zone, and he was promoted after pitching 13 consecutive scoreless innings. He presented the Yankees\u2019 best internal option, and Girardi, before the game, cited Greene\u2019s precision as his prevailing strength. \u201cThe big thing,\u201d Girardi said, \u201cis that he throws strikes.\u201d Greene did throw strikes, 56 of them among his 88 pitches, allowing only one base runner \u2014 Asdrubal Cabrera, the second batter of the game, who was hit by a pitch \u2014 through four innings. Blitzing through those four innings on 45 pitches \u2014 the sort of economy displayed only, it seems, by Yankees starters named Masahiro Tanaka \u2014 Greene did not allow a hit until Nick Swisher\u2019s opposite-field homer with two outs in the fifth.\u201cI told myself I\u2019d rather give up a home run than a walk, and I did that,\u201d said Greene, who struck out two, gave up four hits and did not issue a walk in earning his first career victory. \u201cJust try to get ahead and make them hit my pitch.\u201d It soothed his nerves, Greene said, that he pitched most of the night with the advantage. \u201cI\u2019ve never pitched before,\u201d Gardner said, \u201cbut I know guys like it when we can get them a lead.\u201dWhich they did in the second inning, pounding Justin Masterson for three runs. If not for the sparkling defense of Carlos Santana, though, the Yankees still might be batting. Seven consecutive Yankees reached base off Masterson in a rally that included run-scoring hits by Brian Roberts and Gardner. But Masterson was rescued when, with one out and the bases loaded, a grounder that Jacoby Ellsbury rocketed toward the right-field corner never quite got there. Santana, diving to his left, snared the ball, touched the bag and fired home for an inning-ending double play. It was only a temporary respite for Masterson, who was yanked after allowing the first two hitters to reach in the third. \u201cWe were a couple inches from probably scoring a whole bunch,\u201d Girardi said.It was the solid contact that encouraged Girardi, whose team, after a five-game skid (and nine losses in 10 games), has now won four of its last five with its best pitcher, Tanaka, slated to start on Tuesday. Girardi watched his hitters spray balls throughout Progressive Field, and saw Greene restore some equilibrium to a sagging rotation, and when the clubhouse opened to reporters, a song blared from the speakers, loud and proud: Ice Cube\u2019s \u201cIt Was a Good Day.\u201dINSIDE PITCHThe right-hander Brandon McCarthy, acquired Sunday from Arizona, is to start Wednesday. ... Dellin Betances stifled the Indians over the final two innings for his first career save.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Detention of Sarkozy, France Laments Presidency\u2019s Faded Grandeur", "Date": "2014-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From FrancePARIS \u2014 The monarchical majesty of the French presidency suffered an undignified blow early this year when paparazzi photographed the head of state, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, scurrying away on the back of a scooter from an assignation with a secret lover. This week it took an unprecedented new hit: Mr. Hollande\u2019s predecessor in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose phone had been tapped by investigators, was taken into police custody.Yann Moix, a French writer and filmmaker, summed up a mood of dismay at the indignities visited on France\u2019s once-lofty presidency in a television talk show dedicated to Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s detention, which stretched so late into the night that the former president\u2019s chauffeur went home without him.\u201cThe car of Nicolas Sarkozy is empty,\u201d Mr. Moix said after watching footage of the Citro\u00ebn limousine, its back seat unoccupied, pulling away from the Nanterre police offices. \u201cThe \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace often seems empty these days, too. What happened to the republic?\u201dAngst over the state of the republic, and life in general, is something of a perennial condition in France, where the present never seems to quite match up to the glories, real or imagined, of the past.The French presidency, the centerpiece of the new constitutional and quasi-monarchical order put in place in 1958 and known as the Fifth Republic, was tailored by de Gaulle to fit his own outsize personality and sense of mission. This ensured that nobody else would ever fill its grandiose dimensions. \u201cI had no predecessor and will have no successor,\u201d de Gaulle observed.But the shrinking of the French presidency, a process built into its original design, has been accelerated of late not only by the banal misadventures in Mr. Hollande\u2019s private life and an avalanche of judicial troubles for his right-wing predecessor, but also by a growing public disenchantment with all institutions of state.\u201cThere is a feeling that the Fifth Republic has exhausted itself,\u201d said Christophe Barbier, chief editor of L\u2019Express, a newsmagazine. \u201cThings can\u2019t go on like this,\u201d he added, predicting \u201can enormous cracking\u201d of the system if the presidency and subordinate institutions cannot prove themselves up to the task of reviving France\u2019s sluggish economy, generating jobs, and finding an honorable role for a former world power that now gets hectored by Brussels over its missed budget targets.Left-wing activists, including Mr. Hollande\u2019s former longtime partner, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, have for years promoted the idea of a Sixth Republic, a new model that would trim the powers of the presidency and replace France\u2019s \u201cmonarchical republic\u201d with a system dominated by Parliament.Their proposals have gained little traction, and the sense of drift seems likely to endure. \u201cIn France, we only change the system when there is a revolution or a war,\u201d Mr. Barbier said.Mr. Sarkozy, mindful that French voters would like their current and former presidents to be beyond reproach but generally suspect the worst of them, insisted in a television interview on Wednesday that he was not asking for \u201cany special privileges or advantages.\u201d But he denounced the accusations of corruption and influence-peddling as the \u201cpreposterous\u201d fruit of a politically motivated vendetta.\u201cI am profoundly shocked by what happened,\u201d he said, referring to his extended detention in Nanterre and transfer under police guard late at night to meet two investigating magistrates in central Paris.Former presidents have been investigated before and, in the case of Jacques Chirac, even convicted \u2014 in his case for embezzling public funds and breach of trust \u2014 but none had been formally detained until Mr. Sarkozy spent the better part of Tuesday in custody. And none, as far as the public knows, has suffered Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s indignity of having private telephones tapped by investigators.During his time as president, Mr. Sarkozy often rejected the stuffy formality and rituals of his office, marrying a former model, Carla Bruni, after a whirlwind courtship and hanging out on yachts with wealthy friends, earning himself the title of \u201cpresident bling-bling.\u201d Mr. Hollande, who ran on a promise to be a less showy \u201cnormal president,\u201d has become so deeply unpopular that an opinion poll earlier this year suggested that voters would prefer even Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund who in 2011 faced charges, later dropped, of sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper in New York.Mr. Hollande has disappointed by being too insipid. He stirred little moral outrage by cheating on his official and now ex-mistress, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, but raised eyebrows by looking goofy wearing a silly helmet on the back of the scooter after a clandestine rendezvous with Julie Gayet, an actress. The French presidency does not involve a vow of celibacy but does demand a sense of decorum. Moreover, Mr. Hollande himself had vowed to show \u201cexemplary behavior at every moment.\u201d\u201cAll presidential regimes have a problem with public disappointment,\u201d said Pascal Perrineau, a professor at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques in Paris. \u201cBut the problem is far more acute in France because, in the national subconscious, there has always been the figure of a monarch or a republican monarch. When the person in power looks feeble, the disappointment is felt very strongly.\u201dFor voters on the left, Mr. Perrineau said, Mr. Hollande is \u201ca pale copy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand,\u201d a fellow Socialist. Though far from faithful to his wife and dogged for decades by scandals, including the staging of a fake assassination attempt against himself, Mr. Mitterrand displayed such hauteur in office that he satisfied expectations of a regal president. Voters on the right, meanwhile, \u201csee all these scandals around Sarkozy and realize that he is not de Gaulle.\u201dMr. Sarkozy, who had hoped to make a political comeback and may still try, has outdone all his predecessors by becoming entangled in seven different \u201caffaires,\u201d as the French call the uproarious scandals that flare up in a blaze of news media attention and, more often than not, vanish in a mist of public bewilderment.Placed under formal investigation on Wednesday in the corruption and influence-peddling case, he has also been accused in the news media of receiving $68 million in illegal financing from Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya for his successful 2007 election campaign. Other allegations involve fiddling with the books of his failed 2012 election campaign, crooked financial dealing in connection with a Pakistani arms contract and assorted other transgressions.Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s former prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, said justice must be allowed to run its course, but demanded more dignified treatment for a man who had served as France\u2019s head of state. \u201cAs a former president of the republic,\u201d Mr. Fillon said, \u201che has the right to respect.\u201dMa\u00efa de la Baume contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rotten Mango Crisis", "Date": "2014-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAS an apprentice anthropologist, I once had the misfortune of attempting to converse with the Indian critical theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. Professor Spivak, who translated the work of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida and wrote the famous essay \u201cCan the Subaltern Speak?\u201d, was visiting Dhaka, Bangladesh, and I went to meet her. After patiently listening while I asked a series of dumb questions about discursive practice, she turned and said, cryptically, \u201cI came for the mangoes.\u201dAh, the mango. It may be a clich\u00e9d pitfall for the South Asian writer, but for this academic, famous for her impenetrable prose, the mango brought the esoteric down to earth. Ms. Spivak is regarded as one of the great minds of her generation, but in Dhaka, she was, like everyone else, there for the mangoes. In Bangladesh, the obsession with the mango comes from its evanescence. The fruit\u2019s intense seasonality means that even the more prosaic varieties are available for only a few weeks of the summer. The most prized is the langra: Its floral, slightly sour flavor is more complex than the overly sweet chaunsa or Alphonso mangoes. Aficionados love the langra in part because it is almost impossible to catch at its peak \u2014 too green and your tongue will swell and itch; a few hours late and its flesh turns to mush.But this year, the langra is nowhere to be found. The markets are empty.On the roads that lead into Dhaka, the precious fruit lies rotting by the truckload. The reason: chemical poisoning. The langras are said to be contaminated with formalin, a strong solution of formaldehyde that is sprayed on the fruit to extend its life.The practice of spraying fruit with formalin is one problem, but more worrying is that the entire food chain is compromised \u2014 the soil itself contaminated by toxins that are almost impossible to eradicate. Bangladesh was born in the shadow of famine, and since independence in 1971, a series of government measures have put increasing pressure on farmers to keep the rice yields going up every year. This has meant intensive farming, extensive irrigation and the unchecked use of groundwater. The land has borne the cost of our need to climb out of famine.Dhaka\u2019s brouhaha over contaminated fruit speaks to a growing chasm between the urban and the rural. This broken, congested city is where we have placed all our hopes for a better Bangladesh. The capital is where you will find the budding start-ups, the college graduates, the cellphone users, the social networkers \u2014 all the engines of economic growth. And as we become more removed from the traditional modes of food production, the agricultural hinterland is being treated as nothing more than the food source for a hungry city.But when we place checkpoints on the roads into our city, we are saying that we care only if urban citizens are poisoned; we couldn\u2019t care less if the contaminated fruit is consumed outside of Dhaka. Ms. Spivak may have used the mango as a way to express her rootedness, but a taste for mangoes reveals a person to be among the few who can afford them. The truth is, the fruit is grown by the rural poor and fed to the urban rich. To keep the city sated with mangoes, the crop must be abundant and beautiful. And for that, formalin must be involved.As Ramadan approached and the langra disappeared, the fruit sellers and the state came to an agreement. The fruit sellers would end their strike so that the population could sit down to its dates and apples after a long day of fasting; the police agreed to look into obtaining new devices to test the levels of formalin in fruit.Unless, however, we think critically about the moral economy of food, about sustainability as well as growth, our food will be tainted. If the rationality of urbanism continues to dominate, we will merely be polishing the surface of a rotting core.A contributing opinion writer and the author of the novel \u201cA Golden Age.\u201d Advertisement"}

They decided to forge on, having already raised about $65,000 for the production. (Mr. Lombardo directs and wrote the book with Ms. Brandt; all three collaborated on the lyrics.)\u201cIt\u2019s pretty important to me right now that this is happening, and that it\u2019s happening at this particular moment in time is poignant in a number of ways,\u201d Mr. Lombardo said in an interview after a rehearsal last week. It\u2019s also pretty risky. Producing any show in New York City is a gamble that rarely pays off financially, and presenting one at the musical theater festival is among the diciest of such bets.

{"Headline": "On Long Island, a Collective Sigh of Relief", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat loud whoosh heard around Long Island on Thursday afternoon may not have been the release of air brakes on commuter trains but the collective exhalation of the commuters themselves.After weeks of buildup toward a threatened walkout by the unions that operate the Long Island Rail Road, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that a deal had been reached to head off a strike without additional fare increases. The agreement averted a shutdown of the train system that could have left thousands of people without a reliable way to get home from beach towns, from Far Rockaway to Montauk, on Sunday, and thousands more unable to go to work in Manhattan on Monday.As word of the accord spread, relieved New Yorkers rekindled arrangements for weekend getaways and shelved their contingency plans for commuting the hard way. The first strike against the railroad in 20 years suddenly was a quagmire forestalled.\u201cTomorrow afternoon can\u2019t come soon enough,\u201d said Steve Cirillo, a management consultant from Manhattan, who instantly revived his plan for an early escape to Fire Island on Friday. Without trains to get him to and from Sayville, where he would hop a ferry to the island, the cost of the trip would have been prohibitive, he said. So he had held his breath while monitoring reports about the on-again, off-again negotiations.\u201cI\u2019m happy that a resolution has come to fruition, especially for those daily commuters whose jobs and livelihoods depend on it,\u201d Mr. Cirillo said.Some of New York\u2019s biggest employers had arranged for vans and buses to collect their employees on Long Island and deliver them to offices in the city. A spokesman for BNY Mellon said the bank had \u201cseveral hundred\u201d employees who ride the Long Island Rail Road and that most of them had received permission to work from home if necessary. The office of the state\u2019s comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, had estimated that a strike would have taken a $50 million bite out of the regional economy every weekday that it lasted.Chris Freddo, 48, who lives in Garden City and frequently takes trains into New York to meet clients, said a strike would have hurt the printing business he co-owns. \u201cAs much as I am relieved there was a settlement, it does strike me a bit crazy that it got to this,\u201d Mr. Freddo said. \u201cIt feels like they were holding us for ransom.\u201dA shutdown would have been particularly trying for businesses and workers who could not have done their work from their dens or the nearest Starbucks. At Emtec Consultants in Ronkonkoma, Anthony Musumeci had been studying maps of the five boroughs pinned to a conference room wall, plotting the best way to get a team of inspectors to building sites from Brooklyn to the Bronx.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in my contracts that says if there\u2019s an L.I.R.R. strike that I don\u2019t have to come in today,\u201d Mr. Musumeci said while the negotiations appeared to be stalled. \u201cI have to get there.\u201dAfter reading a summary of the deal that the governor brokered, Mr. Musumeci pronounced himself relieved, with a tinge of cynicism. \u201cI am surprised that they didn\u2019t wait till the last minute to make him look like more of a hero,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Cuomo. Even occasional users of the railroad broke into smiles when told there would be no strike. After stepping off an afternoon train to Bellmore from a visit with a friend in Kew Gardens, Queens, Shirley Hellerman said she no longer had to worry about keeping her next appointment with her ophthalmologist.\u201cI was nervous of the strike because the L.I.R.R. is my fallback,\u201d Ms. Hellerman said. \u201cI am a very reluctant driver and I count on the railroad to get me to my doctor\u2019s appointments, to see my friends and go to the opera and to concerts in Manhattan.\u201d \u201cOpera season starts in the fall,\u201d she added. \u201cI have a lot of tickets and now I don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dDavid Schatz, 62, an engineer from East Meadow, said he could go home and unpack the bags he had ready for any of several options. He had been going to stay with his son in Brooklyn, visit friends in New Rochelle, have his company book a hotel room for him or, if it came to that, find \u201ca little cubbyhole\u201d in his office building and \u201cshack out\u201d there until the trains were running again.Evan Gallahou, an executive recruiter who commutes daily to Manhattan from his home in Merrick, joked that the settlement may have saved his marriage. Mr. Gallahou, 41, who also performs as a stand-up comedian, had been contemplating all of his alternatives in the event of a strike, including working from home. \u201cMy wife is more relieved than I am, since I won\u2019t have to work from home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a much better relationship when we don\u2019t see each other.\u201dRuth Bashinsky and Joseph Berger contributed reporting.videovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Invasion of Britain", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORQUAY, England \u2014 It\u2019s that time of year again. Every July and August, an army of teenagers, several hundred thousand strong, marches, flies, sails, drives and rides trains across Europe toward Britain. The invasion is peaceful, and meets no resistance. In fact, the British welcome it.In Oxford, Cambridge and Exeter, youngsters from abroad fill university dormitories and housing vacated by students. In seaside towns like Torquay, in Devon, or Bournemouth, in Dorset, elderly English retirees mingle on the beachside walk with bubbly Spanish youngsters, sharing bad weather and indifferent food. If you\u2019re middle-aged, you\u2019re in the wrong place.Some come to work, though most come to study. Teaching English and hosting foreign students is a sustainable industry that brings in $1.2 billion every summer and injects tourism-fueled life into parts of the country that badly need it.But it also shapes the students, and not just because they learn English. These young people, largely from educated middle-class families, will go home and eventually fill the professional ranks of the countries\u2019 economies. But they will retain a connection to Britain, and through it to the rest of the European Union. If you want to know what holds the Continent together, this is it, to a surprising extent.These cheery young invaders have an official reason for being in England: to improve their English. And they do, a little, though not always because of their classes: The only way a 17-year-old Italian boy can talk to a 16-year-old Swedish girl is by smiling, gesturing and trying out his English.If motivation drives learning, the Italian is on a roll. That girl from Malmo is the unspoken reason he has come all the way from Milan: she, and of course a first taste of freedom. The \u201cvacanza-studio\u201d \u2014 called a \u201cstudy-vacation\u201d in English, but in Italian the vacation bit comes first \u2014 is the one time Italian families let their children off the leash.It all started back in the early \u201970s. I was one of the enthusiastic pioneers, the first time in Eastbourne, in windy Sussex, and then in Edinburgh, in rainy Scotland, and finally in majestic London. Each year from 1972 to 1974, I journeyed to Britain to listen to Alice Cooper songs in cavernous discos with French names (La Poubelle \u2014 The Trash Can); to go to concerts at the Rainbow Theater, where a sassy David Bowie strutted his stuff in the guise of Ziggy Stardust; and to dodge heavy-booted skinheads who didn\u2019t appreciate our attempts to socialize with their female friends.In a word, Britain was heaven. We didn\u2019t care if our English hosts in their semidetached homes had windowless bathrooms and viewed bidets as continental perversions. We didn\u2019t mind if they ate as much for breakfast as we did for dinner, had dinner just after lunch (5 p.m.?!) and ate supper when it was time for bed. We enjoyed meeting other teenagers like us for the first time. We discovered Europe in the least European of countries \u2014 Britain. And we loved it.Forty years on, nothing has changed. The British may have voted en masse for Nigel Farage\u2019s Euroskeptic U.K. Independence Party in the recent election for the European Parliament, but Britain is still Europe\u2019s exciting boot camp. Hundreds of thousands of young men and women come from Lisbon, Leipzig, Vienna, Valencia, Bordeaux and Bologna to make friends, fall in love and pledge eternal Facebook friendship to each other. Their obvious differences make finding out they have so much in common all the more exciting; the unlikely bond formed between a boy from Warsaw and a girl from small-town Portugal is the one most likely to last.Claude Debussy composed \u201cLa Mer\u201d in Eastbourne. Since then, generations of Italians, French, Germans, Spanish, Greeks and Portuguese have composed their own Europe there. In the past 10 years, Poles, Hungarians and Czechs have joined the chorus. This is a stronger, more vigorous Europe than the one Eurocrats craft, often painfully, every day in Brussels. And this is a Europe that will endure, come what may.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pelosi, in Reversal, Says She Opposes Speeding Child Deportations ", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, reversed course on Wednesday and said she would not back changes to a 2008 law that gave certain undocumented immigrant children broader legal rights to enter the United States.Ms. Pelosi had suggested this month that she could accept changes to the Bush-era law that would expedite the deportation of children in exchange for President Obama\u2019s emergency $3.7 billion request to deal with a sudden surge of unaccompanied minors at the border, mainly from Central America.The Democratic leadership\u2019s hard line raises the prospects of an impasse on Capitol Hill that leaves the Obama administration with no additional resources to deal with the border surge. Republican leaders have said they will not give the president a \u201cblank check\u201d without policy changes. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus was set to meet with Mr. Obama on Wednesday afternoon, and White House officials were to brief Democratic senators on the border issue in the evening.Ms. Pelosi, in an interview on Wednesday, said she had spoken with Mr. Cuellar, and suggested it was not a friendly conversation.The number of children crossing the U.S. border alone has doubled since last year. Answers to key questions on the crisis.\u201cI do think the bill that was introduced is exactly the wrong way to go,\u201d she said. \u201cIs the only immigration bill we\u2019re going to have one that hurts children?\u201dShe said the Congressional Hispanic Caucus had united against any bill that changes the way children migrants are treated. The rest of the House Democratic caucus will follow the Latino lawmakers\u2019 lead, she said.\u201cThis crisis is an opportunity to demonstrate who we are as a country,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.Ms. Pelosi sought to highlight what she sees as a stark contrast between House Republicans pursuing a lawsuit against Mr. Obama and House Democrats who unveiled a legislative agenda for 2015 in the event that they take control of the House.That agenda includes raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, allowing college students and graduates to refinance their student loans at lower interest rates, expanding access to preschool for 4-year-olds, and mandating paid sick leave nationally.\u201cWhile they are engaged in suing the president, with the opportunity costs of time and money on that, we\u2019re talking about jobs,\u201d she said.Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio on Wednesday made virtually the same point, but he blamed Senate Democrats.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Tasty and Political: Britain Presses U.S. on Haggis", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British government is pulling out all the stops for Scotland with a referendum on independence two months away, going so far as to lobby the United States government to allow the importation of that famous Scottish delicacy made from sheep\u2019s innards, haggis.The problem, it seems, is sheep lungs, which the United States banned for consumption in 1971. But lungs are vital to traditional haggis, which usually also contains minced sheep heart and liver, mixed with onion, oatmeal, suet and spices. It\u2019s all stuffed into a sheep\u2019s stomach, which is then simmered for several hours. Delicious, no?Well, actually, it is rather nutty and flavorful \u2014 helped, of course, less by the common side dishes of mashed rutabaga and potato than by the other traditional accompaniment, Scotch whisky.Needless to say, there is a lot of debate about the origin of this delicacy, which is particularly favored on Burns Night, Jan. 25 \u2014 a celebration of the birthday of Robert Burns, considered Scotland\u2019s national poet \u2014 and often on New Year\u2019s Eve, or Hogmanay, when its appearance is sometimes met with bagpipes.But all those Scots in America have been deprived of proper haggis, which could also open an export market of several million dollars. Despite American production of \u201clung-free\u201d haggis, it\u2019s not the real thing.The problem is bigger than haggis, however. British lamb has been banned from the United States since 1989 \u2014 amid the crisis over bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as mad cow disease \u2014 and sheep lungs were banned because of the risk of contamination by scrapie, a variant of the same disease. Only last year, the United States agreed to allow the importation of British beef again, though British goats remain banned.So the British environment secretary, Owen Paterson, made a visit to Washington last week to lobby for haggis, which he made a centerpiece of his trip. \u201cI will continue to do everything I can to boost exports of everything from whisky to haggis to support Scotland\u2019s farmers and rural economy,\u201d he said.Upon his return to Britain, a breathless kingdom was told that progress had been made, but that the barriers still stood.In a statement, Mr. Paterson spoke of a \u201cspecialist food sector\u201d in the United States worth $85 billion a year; in Britain, the market for haggis alone is about $25 million. He said he had met with the agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, \u201cand other members of President Obama\u2019s team,\u201d as well as with various companies. \u201cWe\u2019ve made progress at opening up new markets for top-quality British produce, including cheese, confectionary, beef, lamb and haggis,\u201d he said.Mr. Paterson was clearly heeding the injunction with which Burns ended his ode, here in translation, to haggis:You powers, who make mankind your care,And dish them out their bill of fare,Old Scotland wants no watery stuff,That splashes in small wooden dishes;But if you wish her grateful prayer,Give her a Haggis!Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Worrisome news about a Portuguese bank also revived fears of another European debt crisis. That weighed on stocks, which had closed out the previous week at new highs.Investors are now mulling whether market valuations are justified by the outlook for company earnings, or whether they have risen too far, too fast.As investors try to make sense of the market, \u201cwe could be in a holding pattern,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, an investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index posted a weekly decline of 0.9 percent, its biggest since April 11. It rose 2.89 points on Friday, or 0.15 percent, to 1,967.57.

{"Headline": "Stronger Growth Predicted in China", "Date": "2014-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s economic growth quickened in the second quarter from the previous three months, but further modest government support measures will still be needed, Premier Li Keqiang said on Monday.Speaking at a news conference with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who is visiting Beijing, Mr. Li said that the Chinese economy still faced downward pressure and that the government would increase its use of targeted measures to bolster growth.His cautiously optimistic remarks may raise market confidence ahead of China\u2019s second-quarter economic report, due on July 16. Analysts polled by Reuters say that they expect China\u2019s growth for the April-June period to have steadied at 7.4 percent.\u201cChina\u2019s economic performance in the second quarter has improved from that in the first quarter,'\u2019 Mr. Li said. \u201cHowever, we cannot lower our guard against downward pressures.\u201d\u201cWe will keep up our composure and not adopt strong stimulus,\u201d he added. \u201cInstead, we will increase the strength of targeted measures.\u201dTo lift China\u2019s flagging economic growth, which hit an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first quarter of 2014, the authorities have cut taxes, ordered regional governments to speed up spending and reduced the amount of cash that some banks have to hold as reserves.Use of these so-called targeted measures is meant to help areas of the economy with business needs, and is a departure from the past, when China would cut interest rates or reserve requirements for all banks and increase spending across the country.But on the back of China\u2019s rapid credit growth in recent years, some experts \u2014 including the International Monetary Fund \u2014 have urged the Chinese authorities to desist from drastically loosening policy and to focus on pursuing economic overhauls.Surveys of China\u2019s manufacturing and services sectors have suggested that growth in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, may have stabilized in recent months, though a cooling property sector has risen as a large threat.Mr. Li said that the authorities would further fine-tune policies, and he expressed confidence that the government\u2019s growth target of around 7.5 percent for this year would be met. But he added that the authorities do not plan any major stimulus program.Ms. Merkel and Mr. Li signed agreements Monday that included the investment by Volkswagen of 2 billion euros, or $2.7 billion, in two new vehicle plants in the cities of Tianjin and Qingdao. China is the biggest market for Volkswagen, which sold 1.5 million vehicles in the country in the first five months of this year, the company said.Also in connection with the visit by Ms. Merkel, Lufthansa, the German airline, and Air China, China\u2019s flag carrier, signed a memorandum of understanding to expand and strengthen their partnership.The two carriers, members of the Star Alliance, also said they were working to offer better flight connections, particularly on China-Europe routes, and expand collaboration in maintenance, repair and overall services.Under the deal, Air China and Lufthansa plan to set up a joint venture that will allow them to share revenue on certain routes by selling tickets for each other\u2019s flights. The partnership could be in effect by the start of the winter timetable in October, Lufthansa said.Lufthansa has similar agreements in place with United Airlines and Air Canada on links between Europe and North America, and with All Nippon Airways on routes to Japan. Such joint ventures allow airlines to sidestep foreign-ownership rules and work together on routes and pricing without running afoul of competition regulations.Lufthansa has switched to smaller planes to reduce capacity on Asian routes after expansion by rivals such as Emirates and Turkish Airlines. It said in May that its performance in Asia was stabilizing.Also Monday, an Airbus Group division completed a deal to sell 123 helicopters to Chinese companies.The orders \u2014 including light, single-engine helicopters from the Ecureuil family and the light, twin-engine EC135 \u2014 are being placed by three Chinese general aviation service providers, Airbus Helicopters said in a statement. The company has its headquarters in France but does some of its manufacturing in Germany.\u201cWe are grateful to the operators for selecting Airbus Helicopters to be their partner in developing the general aviation market to serve China\u2019s needs,\u201d said Guillaume Faury, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is evident that China\u2019s relaxation of its low-altitude airspace regulations is enabling the country\u2019s burgeoning helicopter market to realize its potential.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Responses Vary", "Date": "2014-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters To the Editor:Citizens have more to fear from murder, arson, rape, muggings, robberies, auto and identity theft, and home break-ins. Free law enforcement to pursue those who commit real crimes against citizens and property.What consenting adults consume or inhale in the privacy of their own home or social club isn\u2019t the concern of government. Let us hope that we have finally learned from the obvious failures of Prohibition.To the Editor:Your opinion, in \u201cRepeal Prohibition, Again,\u201d that marijuana should be legalized is based in part on an assumption that during Prohibition \u201cpeople kept drinking.\u201d Prohibition reduced the public\u2019s alcohol intake considerably. The rate of alcohol-associated illness dropped in similar fashion. Prohibition was perhaps a political failure, but an impressive success from a public health standpoint.Both alcohol and marijuana can lead to the chronic disease of addiction, directly affect the brain and negatively affect function. As more than 10 percent of our population has addictive disease, your statement that marijuana is \u201cfar less dangerous than alcohol\u201d doesn\u2019t reflect decades of research demonstrating risks associated with both of these drugs.Why would we possibly wish to add to the alcohol- and tobacco-driven personal and public health catastrophe with yet another substance to which some people will become addicted?Some people use marijuana currently. Legalize it, and more people will use more marijuana, leading to more addiction, lower productivity and higher societal costs.To the Editor:While I wholeheartedly agree with the editorial board that we need to end the federal prohibition on marijuana, Congress is not as paralyzed on this issue as many may think.A growing, bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in the House has approved five measures in a row that represent incremental steps to rationalize our failed marijuana policy. There are more than a dozen bills pending, most with bipartisan sponsorship, that would create a framework for legalization.The House has voted to increase access to banking services for marijuana businesses in states where they are legal, and prevent the Drug Enforcement Administration from using funds to interfere with state medical marijuana laws. This majority in the House seems to realize what many Americans already knew: Prohibition has failed.As my home state of Oregon prepares to vote on legalization of adult recreational marijuana this fall, we must redouble our efforts in Congress to finish this important work of reform. The writer, a Democrat, represents the Third Congressional District of Oregon. To the Editor:Thank you for your editorial calling for a repeal of marijuana prohibition. The marijuana plant is incapable of causing an overdose death. Not even aspirin can make the same claim, much less alcohol or prescription narcotics. Marijuana prohibition, on the other hand, has caused untold deaths in the form of violent drug cartel turf battles and botched \u201cno knock\u201d police raids on residential homes.Marijuana can be harmful if abused. Marijuana prohibition does not make the plant any safer. In fact, it compounds the dangers of marijuana by granting a monopoly on marijuana distribution to drug cartels that sell meth, cocaine and heroin. Marijuana prohibition is a gateway drug policy. It\u2019s time for Congress to stop confusing the drug war\u2019s tremendous collateral damage with a comparatively harmless plant.To the Editor:I am disappointed by your decision to endorse the legalization of recreational marijuana. Legalization would affect our youth and communities for generations, just as tobacco has done.The marijuana industry, like Big Tobacco, has shown that it has no compunction about marketing its products to our young people. And in Colorado, we\u2019ve seen the negative public health effects of legalization: increased admissions to emergency rooms, increases in marijuana-positive fatal car crashes, increased reports of kids as young as middle-school age bringing marijuana to school.Marijuana is not a safe drug. It harms youths. It harms economies, with extra social costs. How can this be the way forward for America? Don\u2019t our communities deserve better?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Break the Immigration Impasse", "Date": "2014-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsAMERICAN citizens are paying 535 people to take care of the legislative needs of the country. We are getting shortchanged. Here\u2019s an example: On June 10, an incumbent congressman in Virginia lost a primary election in which his opponent garnered only 36,105 votes. Immediately, many Washington legislators threw up their hands and declared that this one event would produce paralysis in the United States Congress for at least five months. In particular, they are telling us that immigration reform \u2014 long overdue \u2014 is now hopeless. Americans deserve better than this.The three of us vary in our politics and would differ also in our preferences about the details of an immigration reform bill. But we could without doubt come together to draft a bill acceptable to each of us. We hope that fact holds a lesson: You don\u2019t have to agree on everything in order to cooperate on matters about which you are reasonably close to agreement. It\u2019s time that this brand of thinking finds its way to Washington.Most Americans believe that our country has a clear and present interest in enacting immigration legislation that is both humane to immigrants living here and a contribution to the well-being of our citizens. Reaching these goals is possible. Our present policy, however, fails badly on both counts.We believe it borders on insanity to train intelligent and motivated people in our universities \u2014 often subsidizing their education \u2014 and then to deport them when they graduate. Many of these people, of course, want to return to their home country \u2014 and that\u2019s fine. But for those who wish to stay and work in computer science or technology, fields badly in need of their services, let\u2019s roll out the welcome mat.A \u201ctalented graduate\u201d reform was included in a bill that the Senate approved last year by a 68-to-32 vote. It would remove the worldwide cap on the number of visas that could be awarded to legal immigrants who had earned a graduate degree in science, technology, engineering or mathematics from an accredited institution of higher education in the United States, provided they had an offer of employment. The bill also included a sensible plan that would have allowed illegal residents to obtain citizenship, though only after they had earned the right to do so. Americans are a forgiving and generous people, and who among us is not happy that their forebears \u2014 whatever their motivation or means of entry \u2014 made it to our soil? For the future, the United States should take all steps to ensure that every prospective immigrant follows all rules and that people breaking these rules, including any facilitators, are severely punished. No one wants a replay of the present mess.We also believe that America\u2019s self-interest should be reflected in our immigration policy. For example, the EB-5 \u201cimmigrant investor program,\u201d created by Congress in 1990, was intended to allow a limited number of foreigners with financial resources or unique abilities to move to our country, bringing with them substantial and enduring purchasing power. Reports of fraud have surfaced with this program, and we believe it should be reformed to prevent abuse but also expanded to become more effective. People willing to invest in America and create jobs deserve the opportunity to do so. Their citizenship could be provisional \u2014 dependent, for example, on their making investments of a certain size in new businesses or homes. Expanded investments of that kind would help us jolt the demand side of our economy. These immigrants would impose minimal social costs on the United States, compared with the resources they would contribute. New citizens like these would make hefty deposits in our economy, not withdrawals.Whatever the precise provisions of a law, it\u2019s time for the House to draft and pass a bill that reflects both our country\u2019s humanity and its self-interest. Differences with the Senate should be hammered out by members of a conference committee, committed to a deal.A Congress that does nothing about these problems is extending an irrational policy by default; that is, if lawmakers don\u2019t act to change it, it stays the way it is, irrational. The current stalemate \u2014 in which greater pride is attached to thwarting the opposition than to advancing the nation\u2019s interests \u2014 is depressing to most Americans and virtually all of its business managers. The impasse certainly depresses the three of us.Signs of a more productive attitude in Washington \u2014 which passage of a well-designed immigration bill would provide \u2014 might well lift spirits and thereby stimulate the economy. It\u2019s time for 535 of America\u2019s citizens to remember what they owe to the 318 million who employ them. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buick Sheds Its Old Fogy Image and Lifts G.M.", "Date": "2014-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseAs General Motors teetered on bankruptcy just a few years ago, its venerable Buick division seemed on the brink of extinction. The oldest active automobile brand in North America and a car once known as the \u201cmoving couch\u201d for its plush interiors, Buick catered to a population of people over 65. Sales had fallen to just 102,000 vehicles in 2009.Dealers worried G.M. would abandon them. \u201cI was very nervous,\u201d said Autumn Henderson, general manager of Liberty Buick in Peoria, Ariz., one of the few stand-alone Buick dealers in the country. (Most are linked to GMC or other G.M. brands.) \u201cI\u2019d just taken over the dealership for my parents, and I thought, \u2018Now what\u2019s going to happen?\u2019\u00a0\u201dDespite the long odds, Buick survived. And today, G.M. officials are thanking their lucky stars it did.Over all, G.M.\u2019s sales in June rose 1 percent despite a wave of negative publicity, leaving many analysts scratching their heads: Why haven\u2019t those sales suffered from the crisis over faulty ignitions that has prompted congressional hearings, a slew of lawsuits and huge product recalls?The answer, in a word, seems to be Buick. In the United States, Buick sales in June surged 18 percent from the previous year, the best month since 2006. Sales of Buicks in China, now G.M.\u2019s biggest market, rose 14 percent. Through June, G.M. has sold 133,526 Buicks in the United States, on track to top last year\u2019s total of 205,500. Two G.M. models that have been subject to recalls \u2014 the Chevrolet Cruze and the Malibu \u2014 do seem affected by the bad publicity: Sales of the Cruze dropped 21 percent and those for the Malibu dropped 24 percent.\u201cWe invested heavily in Buick, and it\u2019s starting to pay off,\u201d Mark Reuss, former president of General Motors North America and head of global product development, told me this week. The Reuss family has deep roots in Buick: Mr. Reuss got his start at the division, and his father, Lloyd E. Reuss, G.M.\u2019s former president, was Buick\u2019s chief engineer and general manager. \u201cThis didn\u2019t happen overnight. We got criticized. Why do you need Buick? What is it? But our team pushed through all the critical coverage and is delivering great products that speak for themselves.\u201dWithout much fanfare, Buick has largely reinvented itself. While still positioning Buick as \u201crefined luxury,\u201d as Mr. Reuss put it, Buick abandoned the last vestige of the living room on wheels when it discontinued the full-size Lucerne in 2011 and drastically redesigned the smaller LaCrosse. Since then, it has added seven models, many aimed at a younger, performance-oriented customer.Buick\u2019s newest model is the Encore, a compact crossover sport utility vehicle. The Encore has been a hit in both the United States and China, and has been the top-rated small S.U.V. in the J. D. Power initial quality survey for two consecutive years. Encore sales in June in the United States jumped 82 percent.\u201cYou have to give them credit,\u201d said Ryan Brinkman, an automotive analyst at J. P. Morgan. \u201cA couple of years ago, they were only selling the LaCrosse and the Regal. Then, they expanded into new categories. The Encore has gotten off to a fast start. The compact S.U.V. category is really on fire right now.\u201dBuick also gambled on a broader consumer shift toward premium-price smaller vehicles, which seems to be paying off. \u201cAmericans have stopped equating small with cheap,\u201d Mr. Brinkman said. \u201cThat plays very well for Buick. The market has evolved to allow Buick to sell into higher volume categories with a premium price.\u201dCompetitors have noticed. Mercedes has its small CLA line, BMW has the 1-series and Audi has revamped its compact A3 lineup.Many of these trends have been evident at Liberty Buick, which usually ranks among the top two or three Buick dealerships in the country by volume. \u201cWe had a surge in June,\u201d Ms. Henderson said. The dealership sold 97 vehicles, more than double the number from the previous year. \u201cThe Encore is doing incredibly well. We\u2019ve had trouble keeping them in stock.\u201dAlthough Liberty is in what\u2019s known as a retirement belt outside Phoenix, Ms. Henderson said the average age of her customers was dropping. \u201cWe still have our customer base, which is incredibly loyal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting younger people, professionals. We\u2019re getting trade-ins on Lexus, Infiniti, BMW. We never got those people before. Now, we have all those vehicles on our used car lot.\u201dMs. Henderson said the recalls and the barrage of bad publicity had been a worry, but didn\u2019t seem to be stopping customers from buying. It helps that Buick hasn\u2019t been prominently linked to the ignition switch problems. None of the fatalities linked to the ignition defect occurred in Buicks, and although 2005-9 LaCrosses were subject to a recall related to the ignition switch problem, that model is no longer sold.\u201cOur younger buyers don\u2019t seem overly concerned,\u201d Ms. Henderson said. \u201cThey remember what Toyota went through and accept that it can happen to anyone. They seem to be more forgiving or maybe just more realistic. It\u2019s our older customers who have been calling in. They\u2019re concerned, and they want an explanation.\u201dConnie Lataille, 44, a purchasing manager for a school district, came to Liberty last year after she saw an ad for a used Kia S.U.V. \u201cI thought Buicks were for old people,\u201d she said. Her salesman, Jason Rosen, \u201cwalked me past the new Buicks, and the Encore was so cute. I drove it, and it was exactly what I wanted. My children are teenagers, and I don\u2019t have to haul their stuff around anymore. It zips into parking places and I get better mileage. I\u2019ve had so many people come up and ask me about my car. They don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a Buick.\u201d (Her husband, however, hasn\u2019t been won over. \u201cHe won\u2019t drive it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s fine for me but he\u2019s into performance.\u201d)Ms. Lataille doesn\u2019t feel the recalls have any bearing on her purchase. \u201cJason has been so good about following up, without being pushy,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust him that if there were any issues, he\u2019d let me know.\u201dAarika Buzynski, a neonatal intensive care nurse, also bought an Encore at Liberty, and she\u2019s just 25. \u201cThey seemed thrilled when I came in,\u201d Ms. Buzynski said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but we don\u2019t get many people your age.\u2019 The small size really appealed to me. Being single, not having a family, I don\u2019t need the larger S.U.V. I felt I\u2019d have to compromise with a smaller S.U.V., but the Encore had everything I wanted \u2014 comfort and good fuel economy.\u201dMs. Buzynski, too, said she felt G.M.\u2019s problems were irrelevant to her model. \u201cI\u2019m not a car-savvy person,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m glad the issues don\u2019t affect the Encore. If they did, I think it would have been a concern. It\u2019s a safety issue, and you don\u2019t want to be in the shop all the time.\u201dMr. Rosen, the salesman, said he had been at Liberty for 17 years, and, \u201cIn the last five years, we\u2019ve dropped the average age of our customer 10 to 15 years.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe were looking at a 65 and older crowd, and now it\u2019s 55 and younger. The new Buicks are sportier, more luxurious, and they have the technology that appeals to a more tech-savvy generation. That\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the traffic.\u201dHe said he was surprised that all the bad publicity hadn\u2019t had more of an impact. \u201cPeople bring it up a lot,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they see it as more of a media obsession, and it only affects a few older models. It\u2019s not stopping them from buying.\u201dG.M. has also offered some attractive sales incentives and lease deals, although so far, it seems to have avoided the debilitating across-the-board incentives it resorted to in the past to maintain market share. The automaker has an Independence Day sales promotion underway through Monday, offering 0 percent financing and up to $2,250 cash back on three Buick models (including the Encore).Mr. Brinkman, the analyst, said he expected the ignition switch problem and related recalls to have minimal effect on G.M.\u2019s sales, even at Chevrolet. \u201cEven G.M.\u2019s harshest critics don\u2019t allege they\u2019ve built any of these vehicles since 2007. So do you not buy a 2014 Chevrolet because there was a problem with a 2006 Chevy Cobalt? None of those models are on sale today, which makes this different from Toyota.\u201dMr. Reuss said G.M. was determined to add to Buick\u2019s momentum. \u201cWe\u2019ve built up a tremendous amount of brand equity in the past four years, and we\u2019re going to follow through,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some surprises coming up.\u201d (He wouldn\u2019t say, though, if one of them was a new Riviera, the iconic Buick last produced in 1999. G.M. has been showing a concept Riviera at auto shows.)He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been low-key about Buick. That\u2019s in keeping with the brand. A Buick is never going to scream, \u2018Look at me.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Asks for $3.7 Billion to Aid Border", "Date": "2014-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama urged Congress on Tuesday to quickly provide almost $4 billion to confront a surge of young migrants from Central America crossing the border into Texas, calling it \u201can urgent humanitarian situation.\u201dBut the request quickly became entangled in the fierce political debate over immigration: Republicans said they were wary of Mr. Obama\u2019s request and could not immediately support it, given what they called his administration\u2019s failure to secure the Mexican border after years of illegal crossings. Mr. Obama could face resistance from members of his own party as well.The president said he needed the money to set up new detention facilities, conduct more aerial surveillance and hire immigration judges and Border Patrol agents to respond to the flood of 52,000 children. Their sudden mass migration has overwhelmed local resources and touched off protests from residents angry about the impact on the local economy. In a letter to congressional leaders, Mr. Obama urged them to \u201cact expeditiously\u201d on his request.Republican lawmakers who have long demanded tougher enforcement of immigration laws along the border expressed cautious support on Tuesday for beefing up the federal presence in the Rio Grande Valley, where most of the children have been crossing into the United States.But many Republicans, especially in the House, remain deeply suspicious of the president\u2019s commitment, a mistrust that led to a stalemate on a broader immigration overhaul and now threatens to at least delay speedy passage of Mr. Obama\u2019s $3.7 billion spending request.\u201cLet\u2019s remember, this administration went around for years saying the border has never been more secure than it is now,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2016. \u201cI think that\u2019s been exposed as a fallacy over the last three weeks.\u201dSpeaker John A. Boehner said the president\u2019s plan failed to deploy the National Guard, an idea the White House said would not be effective. And Representative John Carter of Texas said he was wary of any measure that gave Mr. Obama too much autonomy.\u201cThe president caused this self-inflicted crisis on the border by refusing to enforce the law,\u201d said Mr. Carter, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, which is likely to be asked to approve the request. \u201cAnd now he is requesting a $3.7 billion bailout from the taxpayers to rectify his mistakes.\u201dSome Democrats, like Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, have expressed strong misgivings about any plan that would allow for unaccompanied children to be sent back home to dangerous situations.The charged politics will shadow a long-planned trip that Mr. Obama began on Tuesday and will include a two-day stop in Texas. The trip will emphasize the difficulties for the White House on immigration. The president is calling for immediate action on the border even as he remains under pressure by activists to relax deportations.After insisting that Mr. Obama had no plans to visit the Texas-Mexico border, White House officials said he would meet with Gov. Rick Perry.Mr. Perry, who is considering a second run for the Republican presidential nomination, had declined to participate in a photo opportunity with Mr. Obama in front of Air Force One, prompting a last-minute offer by the White House for the two to meet.A Perry spokesman said they would meet privately and attend a round-table discussion with faith leaders and local officials.The president\u2019s funding request is certain to revive legislative passions that prompted Mr. Obama to promise sweeping executive actions to get around Republican opposition to a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. Republicans in both chambers hinted Tuesday that they might insist on corresponding spending cuts or make other demands that Mr. Obama and his allies are likely to oppose.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican, said that Mr. Obama\u2019s request lacked the substantive policy changes needed to deal with issues like detaining those who cross the border illegally and ensuring that they show up for court dates once they are apprehended.\u201cApparently the president has given up on any effort to effect the kind of reforms that he knows and his administration knows are necessary,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said.White House officials said the president was not backing away from a request last week for more flexibility in how enforcement agents treat the Central American migrants who are surging across the border. A 2008 law aimed at combating human trafficking requires officials to provide extra legal protections for migrants from countries that do not share a border with the United States.Those protections are not provided to Mexicans, who are often quickly returned home after being caught trying to enter the United States illegally. White House officials said they would like Congress to allow officials to process migrants from places like Honduras and Guatemala as quickly as Mexicans. One White House official said the administration was seeking to have \u201cone approach to children coming from the region.\u201dOfficials pressed members of Congress on Tuesday to consider the funding request separately from the changes in legal authority. But some lawmakers suggested that they wanted to deal with both issues together. The resulting clash could end up as a replay of the gridlock that prevented the bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013 from being considered in the House.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said that Congress needed to repeal the 2008 human trafficking law. \u201cThe message has to be, \u2018If you cross our border illegally, you will be returned immediately,' \u201d he said.Others have called for an even more aggressive deportation plan than the president\u2019s.Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said the Department of Health and Human Services, which takes in many of the unaccompanied children, needed to be cut out of the process so that law enforcement officials could ship them home more quickly.Mr. Cornyn said Congress should look at allowing the United States armed forces to stop drug and human trafficking.An email to supporters from Heritage Action for America, a political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, signaled the kind of difficulty that Mr. Obama\u2019s request might face from Tea Party conservatives. The group called it \u201ca nonstarter because it seeks to address the symptoms, not the cause.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about President Obama\u2019s asking Congress to provide $3.7 billion to confront a surge of young immigrants from Central America referred incorrectly to Heritage Action for America. It is a nonprofit group organized under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code; it is not a political action committee.Carl Hulse contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israeli Military Invades Gaza, With Sights Set on Hamas Operations", "Date": "2014-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli tanks rolled into the northern Gaza Strip on Thursday night and naval gunboats pounded targets in the south as Israel began a ground invasion after 10 days of aerial bombardment failed to stop Palestinian militants from showering Israeli cities with rockets.Israeli leaders said the incursion was a limited one focused on tunnels into its territory like the one used for a predawn attack Thursday that was thwarted. They said it was not intended to topple Hamas, the militant Islamist movement, from its longtime rule of Gaza.As rockets continued to rain down on Israeli cities, a military spokesman said the mission\u2019s expansion was \u201cnot time bound\u201d and was aimed to ensure Hamas operatives were \u201cpursued, paralyzed and threatened\u201d as it targeted \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d in the north, south and east of Gaza \u201cin parallel.\u201dAs midnight approached Thursday, residents of some sparsely populated farmland in northern Gaza were cowering in their homes, afraid to answer mobile phones or peek out windows. Some sent text messages reporting that they could hear tank shelling, heavy artillery, and F-16s dropping bombs. Moussa al-Ghoul, 63, who lives northwest of Beit Lahiya, said his neighborhood had turned into \u201ca war zone\u201d with tanks surrounding his home, having destroyed those of two of his sons. He said shells were landing \u201ceverywhere.\u201dGaza news outlets reported that electricity had been cut to 80 percent of the coastal territory after cables bringing power from Israel were damaged.After the early-morning tunnel episode, the day settled into an extended calm as both sides observed a United Nations request for a five-hour humanitarian pause in the fighting. But by 3 p.m., the violence roared back as the Palestinian death toll neared 250 and more than 120 rockets rained on cities throughout southern and central Israel all afternoon and evening.\u201cWe will strike Hamas and we are determined to restore peace to the state of Israel,\u201d the military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, told reporters in a conference call. \u201cIt will progress according to the situation assessment and according to our crafted and designed plan of action to enable us to carry out this mission.\u201dIsrael began to call up 18,000 reservists, adding to 50,000 already mobilized in recent days; Colonel Lerner said the ground forces would include infantry and artillery units, armored and engineer corps, supported by Israel\u2019s \u201cvast intelligence capabilities,\u201d air force and navy.Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for Hamas, called the invasion \u201ca dangerous step.\u201d\u201cThe occupation will pay its price expensively,\u201d he said in a statement, referring to Israel, \u201cand Hamas is ready for confrontation.\u201dPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel did not make a public statement Thursday night, but several of his ministers said on television that a unanimous cabinet had authorized Mr. Netanyahu and the defense minister a few days ago to send in ground troops when they deemed necessary.\u201cWith a heavy heart we embarked on this operation, in order to destroy the tunnels, as just this morning we have seen their deadly potential,\u201d said Naftali Bennett, the economy minister and leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party. \u201cDifficult days are ahead of us,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are also operating against the rockets and all of the existing threats, but the No. 1 target is the tunnels.\u201dIsrael did not send ground troops into Gaza during eight days of cross border violence in 2012. It was condemned internationally for an intense three-week air-and-ground campaign in 2008-9, when 1,400 Palestinians were killed along with 13 Israelis in fierce street fighting. Israel originally seized the territory in the 1967 war and evacuated its settlers and soldiers in 2005, but maintained restrictions on imports, exports and travel for the Palestinians left behind.The military operation started about 10 p.m., hours after Israel bombed a rehabilitation hospital and another airstrike killed four children playing on a Gaza City rooftop \u2014 an echo of the previous day\u2019s bombing that left four young children, all cousins, dead on a beach.At the Al-Wafa Rehabilitation Hospital in Gaza City, most but not all of the 17 patients and 25 doctors and nurses were evacuated before the electricity was cut and heavy bombardments nearly destroyed the building, doctors said.\u201cWe evacuated them under fire,\u201d said Dr. Ali Abu Ryala, a hospital spokesman. \u201cNurses and doctors had to carry the patients on their backs, some of them falling off the stairway. There is an unprecedented state of panic in the hospital.\u201dAlong the Gaza City seafront, as tanks entered the north, there was a near-constant staccato of gunboats firing in bursts of five blasts each, sending flashes above the dark water. They were shelling a target south of Gaza\u2019s port, the red lights of their barrels visible from shore, the impact of their artillery echoing a second later.Earlier, warplanes whooshed over the city as they have for more than a week, and the high-pitched hum of drones could be heard over the call to prayer from mosques to end the daily fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\u201cCommunications with Gaza have become problematic\u201d since the ground invasion, said a statement from Christopher Gunness of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides health care, education, and other services for more than half of Gaza\u2019s 1.7 million residents who are classified as Palestinian refugees. The agency is currently sheltering thousands who evacuated their homes. \u201cWe urgently appeal for restraint so that civilians who have suffered enough in this appalling conflict do not suffer further,\u201d Mr. Gunness said.Brig. Gen. Moti Almoz, chief spokesman of Israel\u2019s military, said on television, \u201cI will now, uncharacteristically, ask the residents of Gaza to move away from the areas our forces are operating in \u2014 they are operating with extreme force.\u201dThe United Nations estimates that about three-quarters of those killed so far were civilians, not militants, and about 50 of those were children. Palestinian health officials said at least 17 children died in airstrikes on Wednesday and Thursday, raising sharp new questions about civilian deaths.Relatives collapsed in grief around sunset at Shifa Hospital, where the four children who had been killed on the rooftop \u2014 twin brothers Jihad and Wissam Shuheiber, 8; their cousin Afnan, 10; and a friend, Yassin Al-Himidi, 4 \u2014 were laid on a single table in the morgue, their bodies deceptively intact. One of the boys wore only his underpants, decorated with superheroes.The military declined to offer an explanation for the strike on the rooftop. On Wednesday, after an earlier Israeli strike killed four children on the beach, the military said it aimed to kill Hamas militants and called the civilian deaths a \u201ctragic outcome,\u201d but did not provide details of why it hit a simple shack on the beach and fired again as the children fled. Israeli officials say that they take precautions to avoid hitting civilians but that Hamas makes it hard by firing rockets from residential areas and discouraging residents from evacuating their homes.It had been a roller-coaster day, starting with Israel\u2019s early-morning report that it had foiled the attack through the tunnel at about 4:30 a.m. by striking from the air at 13 Palestinians who emerged from it and tried to infiltrate a kibbutz, the first time that had happened in the current conflagration. Colonel Lerner said later that the incursion \u201cillustrates the clear and immediate threat we have from the Gaza Strip,\u201d and noted that Israel had uncovered four similar tunnels into its territory over the last 18 months.The humanitarian pause urged by the United Nations started at 10 a.m., and Gaza residents filled the streets, shopping for food and toys and crowding cash machines open for the first time since the operation began. But the lull was pierced around noon by a brief flurry of mortars fired from Gaza, with rockets fired toward Israel precisely at 3 p.m., the designated endpoint of the lull. The strikes continued through the afternoon and evening.The daily tally of rocket attacks, airstrikes and deaths in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.Israel shot down a drone near Ashkelon, not far from its border with Gaza, the second unmanned aerial vehicle sent aloft by Gaza this week.At one point, there was word from Egypt that an agreement had been reached for a cease-fire starting at 6 a.m. Friday. Instead, the violence only increased.\u201cWe have to look at this as an operation in stages: its first stage was attacks from the air and sea, and this is the second stage, where we reach contact with the Hamas,\u201d Eli Marom, commander of Israel\u2019s Navy from 2007 to 2011, said on Israel\u2019s Channel 2 News. \u201cYou have to understand this is a long campaign. This is only its second stage, and there can be other stages.\u201dMichael B. Oren, Israel\u2019s former ambassador to Washington, said in a late-night interview that Mr. Netanyahu had \u201cexercised extraordinary restraint up until now\u201d by not engaging ground troops and \u201cpaid a heavy political price for it.\u201d Thursday\u2019s tunnel attack, he said, \u201cwas a game changer,\u201d adding, \u201cEssentially, Hamas invaded Israel first.\u201dIn contrast to the Iron Dome missile-defense system that Israel says has stopped some 300 rockets from hitting populated areas over the last 10 days, Mr. Oren said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a response to the tunnels.\u201dHe added, \u201cThey are reinforced concrete tunnels, basically impregnable from the air and their openings are camouflaged.\u201dAmos Yadlin, director of Israel\u2019s Institution for National Security Studies and former chief of military intelligence, similarly said in a radio interview earlier Thursday that the tunnel attack \u201cclarified to those who were still wondering if it was right to conduct a ground move against certain points.\u201dAn article on July 18 about the beginning of Israel\u2019s ground invasion of the Gaza Strip after 10 days of an aerial bombardment campaign quoted incorrectly from a Twitter message by Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch. He called for an end to illegal targeting, not \u201can end to the killing.\u201dJodi Rudoren reported from Jerusalem, and Anne Barnard from Gaza. Reporting was contributed by Isabel Kershner, Gabby Sobelman and Irit Pazner Garshowitz from Jerusalem, and Fares Akram from Gaza.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece's Watershed Year", "Date": "2014-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Forty years ago this month, a series of monumental events shaped Greece and its people, leaving a legacy that still determines our politics, economy and society. Greece is like a modern parable in its trajectory from the collapse of a military dictatorship, through the restoration of democracy and the euphoria of European Union membership, to the current battle with economic crisis and political uncertainty. In Greece, 1974 was more important even than 1981, the year we joined what was then the European Economic Community, today the European Union. We hardly noticed 1989, and the collapse of the Soviet bloc, until Europe, our region and the global economy changed. Even 2001, when much of the world changed and when Greece adopted the European common currency, and 2004, when Athens hosted a successful Summer Olympics, were mere stops on the road from freedom to economic ruin. The year 1974 set Greece on course for the greatest uninterrupted period of stability and prosperity in our history, but it also consolidated many problems that still plague us: deep mistrust of authority, resistance to reform, unbridled populism in politics and the media, a state-dominated economy that favors specific groups, and a political system that values expedience over efficiency and puts self-interest above the common good. July 1974 was the crucial month. Greece was seven years into an increasingly brutal right-wing military dictatorship. On July 15, Greek Cypriots, with the support of the Greek dictatorship, staged a coup against their government, with the aim of uniting the island republic with Greece. On July 20, Turkey, as guarantor of the Turkish-Cypriot minority, invaded Cyprus. The junta\u2019s culpability, and inept response, prompted its immediate collapse. In the early hours of July 24, Constantine Karamanlis, a former prime minister of Greece exiled in Paris, returned to Athens to form a government of national unity and lead the country to democracy. By the end of 1974, the conservative New Democracy party and the Socialist party Pasok had been formed. (They alternated in power until 2012 when, weakened by the financial crisis, they joined forces in a coalition.) Mr. Karamanlis legalized the long-banned Communist Party, and won a national election by a landslide; he called for an immediate reopening of accession talks with the European Economic Community, which had been frozen during the dictatorship; most important, he called a referendum that abolished the monarchy and established a republic with a parliament, prime minister and president. The dictatorship discredited the authoritarian form of government that had been the norm for Greece, putting an end to a long history of military intervention in politics but also setting off a reaction against authority that still determines public debate and incites frequent protests. Greeks\u2019 faith in NATO was undermined, as the alliance was viewed as tolerant of the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey, also a NATO member, and the occupation of approximately 36 percent of the island\u2019s territory, which continues. The conservative Mr. Karamanlis withdrew Greece from NATO\u2019s military wing for several years, reflecting the fury of Greeks across the political spectrum. This anger still stokes anti-NATO and anti-American feelings in many Greeks, from the extreme left to the extreme right. Furthermore, Washington\u2019s support for the dictatorship was seen as an extension of its support of a nationalist government that had defeated Communist guerrillas in the 1946-49 civil war and suppressed leftist citizens for decades. The end of the dictatorship, even with a conservative government leading the country closer to other European countries, resulted in widespread left-wing, anti-Western sentiment and an often obsessive nationalism in politics and the media. Fear of Turkey has kept military spending high, while the suspicion of foreign intervention has continued to inform the debate during the years of crisis \u2014 with populist parties of the left and right denouncing the \u201ctraitors\u201d and \u201cforeign stooges\u201d in government. To an extent, this explains the curious persistence of left-wing political violence: Greece\u2019s most wanted militant, Nikos Maziotis, leader of the anarchist Revolutionary Struggle, was arrested on July 16 after a shootout with the police in central Athens. At the same time, reaction against the right wing has been so strong since 1974 that extreme-right parties had no electoral presence until the recent economic collapse discredited the mainstream parties. In May\u2019s elections for the European Parliament, a radical left party won the most votes, and a neo-Nazi party placed third. The seeds of economic destruction were also evident in 1974. Although government debt back then equaled just 22.5 percent of gross domestic product, Greece was plagued by double-digit inflation and the effects of the oil crisis; imports far exceeded exports; and political cronyism maintained an uncompetitive economy and a very expensive, inefficient state apparatus. Today, Greece\u2019s state debt amounts to 174.1 percent of G.D.P. Recovery is impossible without a major write-off, leaving Greece in limbo, dependent on domestic political considerations among its European partners who are also its creditors. In December 1974, Xenophon Zolotas, the governor of Greece\u2019s central bank, warned the government: \u201cIf we keep trying to cover the deficit by taking on the heavy burden of new loans, we will only make things worse.\u201d Successive Bank of Greece governors kept saying this. Our spendthrift politicians, with few exceptions, did not adapt to the changing times, choosing to keep voters happy with borrowed funds \u2014 right up until Greece came to the brink of bankruptcy in 2010, our new defining year.

{"Headline": "First Israeli Killed Near Gaza Border", "Date": "2014-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Egypt\u2019s proposal for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas collapsed Tuesday only a few hours after the Israelis had accepted it, as Palestinian militants in Gaza launched a barrage of rockets and Israel resumed its airstrikes. The Israeli authorities said a Palestinian attack caused the first Israeli fatality in the eight-day-old military confrontation, in which Israeli bombings have killed nearly 200 Palestinians.Israel announced at 9 a.m. Tuesday that it had accepted the Egyptian initiative unilaterally, but abandoned it after nearly 50 rockets were lobbed into Israel from Gaza in what was assumed to be a rejection by Hamas and its affiliates. By 3 p.m., Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, confirmed that \u201cwe\u2019ve resumed some striking in Gaza.\u201dThe Israeli military said in later statements that its resumed aerial assaults had hit 30 targets, including 20 concealed rocket launchers, tunnels, weapons storage facilities and \u201coperational infrastructure\u201d of Islamic Jihad, a Gaza-based militant group aligned with Hamas.By evening, the Israeli military said, 125 \u201crockets and mortars\u201d had been fired from Gaza and that 20 had been intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome defense system, but that an Israeli civilian had been killed and an Israeli soldier wounded near the Erez crossing with Gaza.Micky Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the Israel Police, said the civilian was a 37-year-old man who had volunteered to distribute food parcels to Israeli soldiers near the crossing, and who was critically wounded by mortar fire around 7 p.m. The man, whom Mr. Rosenfeld declined to identify, died shortly after in an Ashkelon hospital.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had said earlier that he would respond with force if the rockets did not stop.\u201cWe agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give the opportunity to deal with demilitarization of the strip from missiles, rockets and tunnels through diplomatic means,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said after a meeting with the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. \u201cBut if Hamas does not accept the cease-fire proposal, as it looks now, Israel will have all the international legitimacy in order to achieve the desired quiet.\u201dLeaders of Hamas did not officially respond to Israel\u2019s acceptance of the Egyptian proposal, which was aimed at halting the aerial strikes that began on July 7 and called for Israeli and Palestinian delegations to travel to Cairo within 48 hours to negotiate further terms. Islamic Jihad said in a statement that the Egyptian proposal did not \u201cmeet the needs of our people and the conditions of the resistance, which was not consulted.\u201dMousa Abu Marzouk, a Hamas leader based in Cairo, said in a message posted on Twitter around the time the rockets were flying that the organization was still \u201cconsulting\u201d and had \u201cnot issued an official position on the Egyptian initiative.\u201dA Twitter post, in Hebrew, by Hamas\u2019s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, took responsibility for the rockets that were fired at Israeli cities on Tuesday, adding, \u201cWe will continue to bombard until our conditions are met.\u201dThe current hostilities, in which at least 185 Palestinians have been killed, are the third intense flare-up between Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza in less than six years. They began more than two months after the spectacular collapse of American-brokered peace talks and a month after the swearing-in of a new Palestinian government that was based on a reconciliation pact with Hamas.Tensions had been rising since the June 12 abduction and killing of three Israeli teenagers in the occupied West Bank, which Israel blamed on Hamas, and the July 2 kidnapping and killing of a Palestinian 16-year-old in an apparent revenge attack by extremist Jews.On Tuesday, hospital officials in Gaza said they had admitted a man wounded in an Israeli strike after the cease-fire was supposed to have started. Lying on a stretcher at Shifa Hospital, the patient, Mahmoud Muhanna, 26, said he had been riding a motorbike to check on his family\u2019s residence when an explosion flung him to the pavement, cracking his head.He was admitted around noon, doctors said, and he said the explosion took place sometime after 11 a.m., although the Israeli military said it resumed its attacks only hours later; it was possible he was hit by an errant rocket fired from Gaza. \u201cI heard there was a cease-fire,\u201d he said, cringing as a doctor manipulated his leg. \u201cI was fooled.\u201d Still, Mr. Muhanna, asked if he still wanted a cease-fire to take hold, said, \u201cOf course.\u201dOutside Shifa Hospital, which has treated many of the conflict\u2019s worst casualties and become a focal point of mourning and defiance, several dozen people cheered as a rocket ripped skyward, leaving a white contrail.\u201cYa Qassam, ya habib,\u201d a few men chanted, referring with a term of endearment to the Hamas military brigades that fire the rockets. \u201cStrike, strike Tel Aviv.\u201dIn 2012, when an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire ended eight days of cross-border violence, the deal was celebrated as a Hamas victory with street parades, but on Tuesday, Hamas supporters viewed Egypt\u2019s proposed truce with suspicion. Outside the hospital, a Hamas security officer, who gave only a nickname, Abu Mahmoud, pointed at the rocket and said, \u201cThis is our celebration.\u201dHe referred to the cease-fire proposal as \u201conly a way for Egypt to save face\u201d and said bluntly, \u201cWe don\u2019t accept it.\u201dOther residents in Gaza still held out hope for a cease-fire. \u201cWho would want to be bombed?\u201d said Dr. Ayman al Sahbani.The question, residents say, is where a cease-fire would lead, and whether it would bring any change to Gaza. The Palestinian enclave has been occupied since 1967, and now, despite the pullout of Israeli settlers and troops in 2005, Israel controls their shared border as well as Gaza\u2019s s airspace and seas. There are tough restrictions that have effectively amounted to a blockade, keeping the movement of goods and people to a trickle.\u201cEvery time they have a cease-fire, but then everything comes back: the siege, the closures,\u201d said Wedad al-Jarba, who was at the hospital, where her two-and-a-half-year-old grandson, Maher, was being admitted with a skull fracture. Israel \u201cnever agreed on anything real,\u201d she said.Maher was injured when an explosion struck, hours before the pause in fire was to have taken effect, and he tumbled down 11 steps. He was first taken to a hospital in central Gaza, but had to be moved because it lacked the ability to perform a CT scan, due in part, doctors said, to the budget crisis and import restrictions.The Egyptian proposal, which was embraced by the United States, the Arab League and the Palestinian Authority, calls for border crossings into Gaza to \u201cbe opened,\u201d and for the movement of people and goods to be \u201cfacilitated once the security situation becomes stable on the ground.\u201dSome Israeli politicians criticized the cease-fire plan, saying that not enough damage had yet been inflicted on Hamas\u2019s infrastructure and weapons caches.Avigdor Lieberman, Israel\u2019s foreign minister and a longtime advocate of a more intensive attack on Gaza, voted against accepting the Egyptian cease-fire proposal at an early Tuesday meeting of top ministers known as the security cabinet, as did Naftali Bennett, the economy minister. Mr. Lieberman said at an afternoon news conference that the current operation should only end with the Israeli military \u201ccontrolling all of the Gaza Strip.\u201d\u201cIsrael must go all the way,\u201d Mr. Lieberman told reporters. \u201cA cease-fire is a tacit agreement that Hamas continue to build up its power.\u201dUri Ariel, the housing minister who is in Mr. Bennett\u2019s far-right party, called the decision \u201ca strategic mistake akin to building a train without paving the last kilometer.\u201d On Twitter, he cracked that previous Israeli operations in Gaza had led to quiet for three years and 18 months, while the latest calm lasted an hour \u2014 \u201cimpossible to say there is no progress.\u201dAnd Isaac Herzog, the head of Israel\u2019s Labor Party and leader of the opposition in Parliament, said: \u201cIf the cease-fire doesn\u2019t lead to forward movement in the peace process it is useless.\u201dLater Tuesday evening Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office announced that he had dismissed Danny Danon, his deputy defense minister, who has emerged as one of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s major critics over his handling of the Gaza crisis, describing it as a failure. \u201cIt is inconceivable that the deputy defense minister will attack the country\u2019s leadership leading the campaign,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement.Some analysts had said there were no downsides to Israel\u2019s embrace of the cease-fire proposal: The Egyptian cease-fire would either lead to a genuine calm that benefits both sides or, if Hamas rejected the terms, provide Israel with cover to continue the conflict.\u201cIf Hamas looks at the cards it has been dealt \u2014 and they are very weak cards indeed \u2014 resuming military operations against Israel is not a good hand to play,\u201d Michael B. Oren, Israel\u2019s former ambassador to the United States, told reporters on Tuesday in a conference call organized by The Israel Project, an advocacy group.Speaking before Israel abandoned the cease-fire, Secretary of State John Kerry, who was expected to return to Washington on Tuesday afternoon from Vienna, where he had been trying to iron out a deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, criticized Hamas for continuing to fire rockets after the cease-fire was to have taken effect.\u201cI cannot condemn strongly enough the actions of Hamas in so brazenly firing rockets, in multiple numbers, in the face of a good-will effort,\u201d Mr. Kerry said at a news conference.Mr. Kerry said that it was important for Hamas not to \u201cplay politics\u201d by taking military actions to build up its standing in the Arab world, and he also criticized the group for putting civilians in danger by conducting its operations in civilian neighborhoods.He said that he had been prepared to fly to Cairo to help secure a cease-fire but had decided to return to Washington instead to give the Egyptian plan a chance. \u201cI am prepared to fly back to the region tomorrow if I have to,\u201d he said, if the Egyptian plan \u201cdoes not work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macau Raises Its Political Voice", "Date": "2014-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialDemocratic activists in Macau, a Chinese territory, are planning an unofficial referendum next month about holding direct elections for its chief executive. Beijing says Macau \u2014 a Portuguese colony handed back to China in 1999 \u2014 has no legal authority to hold a referendum, and dismisses any vote as meaningless. But the territory\u2019s newly awakened democratic force is not something Beijing can just wish away.Macau\u2019s universal suffrage movement follows the unofficial referendum in Hong Kong last month that called for the right to freely elect that city\u2019s chief executive. Some 800,000 people voted, and hundreds of thousands took to the streets calling for democracy.Macau, like Hong Kong, enjoys a high degree of autonomy, including freedom of speech and press as well as a capitalist economy, under China\u2019s policy of \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d Macau\u2019s chief executive, though, is elected by a commission of 400 people, most of whom are Beijing loyalists. The proposed referendum will ask Macau residents whether universal suffrage should be adopted for the 2019 chief executive election, and whether they have confidence in the current chief executive, Fernando Chui, who is expected to be re-elected by the commission in August for another five-year term.Macau\u2019s 600,000 residents were politically quiet until recently. Then, in May, 20,000 people protested Mr. Chui\u2019s attempt to legislate a lavish retirement package for top officials and immunity from criminal persecution for the chief executive for any misdeeds committed while in office. What began as a protest against Mr. Chui quickly shaped into a larger democratic movement challenging China.Beijing promised at the time of the British handover of Hong Kong to preserve \u201cone country, two systems\u201d for 50 years, which leaves 33 more years. During this time, the richer southeastern coastal regions of China are likely to become more like Hong Kong and Macau economically, socially and in political aspiration. Beijing should be thinking about how to accommodate these long-term trends instead of conjuring ways to suppress today\u2019s dissent in the two specially administered cities. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Says Fed Will Emphasize Stronger Regulation", "Date": "2014-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said on Wednesday that the central bank did not plan to raise interest rates or alter its stimulus campaign to address concerns about excesses in the financial system.Ms. Yellen reiterated her view that governments should seek to preserve financial stability primarily through stronger regulation, which she described as a work in progress. She said that raising interest rates to deflate financial markets was, at best, a second line of defense, and that she saw no need to consider it now.Fed officials, including Ms. Yellen, have generally played down these concerns. They acknowledge signs of excessive speculation in some areas of financial activity, but have said repeatedly that there is little indication of a threat to the economy.At the same time, officials are debating what to do about future threats. Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, both have underscored the Fed\u2019s postcrisis view that maintaining financial stability is now a primary responsibility.Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that the Fed was focused on strengthening regulation. In a discussion with Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F.\u2019s managing director, Ms. Yellen expressed particular concern about so-called shadow banking, or financial firms like hedge funds that are not subject to many of the strictest regulations.\u201cThat is going to be a huge challenge to which I don\u2019t have a great answer,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen also acknowledged the limits of regulation, noting that new approaches remained untested. For example, a speculative bubble in commercial real estate could be addressed by tightening those underwriting standards. Regulators also are considering broad rules that would automatically constrain lending during periods of strong growth, and then loosen when the economy needed a boost. As a consequence, she said she remained open to the possibility of raising interest rates to pop bubbles. \u201cI\u2019ve not taken monetary policy totally off the table as a measure to be used when financial excesses are happening,\u201d she said.Other Fed officials have argued that the central bank should place a greater weight on financial stability in setting monetary policy. Jeremy C. Stein, who recently left the Fed\u2019s board, argued that raising interest rates could be a broadly effective response to excess speculation, deflating bubbles that regulators hadn\u2019t even noticed.Several officials share Mr. Stein\u2019s views, said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. As a result, the debate \u201cwill likely continue to simmer in coming quarters.\u201d Ms. Yellen, however, made clear that she would prefer to rely on regulation. Raising rates may curtail speculation, but its primary effect is to slow growth.\u201cThe potential cost, in terms of diminished macroeconomic performance, is likely to be too great to give financial stability risks a central role in monetary policy decisions, at least most of the time,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Advertisement"}

Restaurants (and bakeries like mine) stand a better chance of long-term survival if they are tenants of owner-occupied buildings. Usually these owners are invested in their community and purposely select tenants who they feel enhance the community and their buildings.The owners of these buildings need acknowledgment, help (tax breaks?) and encouragement from New York City for their role in preserving the fabric of each community, and thus of the entire city. The writer is the chef and owner of Duane Park Patisserie. To the Editor:In response to Danny Meyer\u2019s perceptive article, may I propose a practical way of saving neighborhood icons like our beloved Union Square Cafe. In parallel to our Landmarks Preservation Commission, we should create a neighborhood icons commission.This commission would create a list of essential neighborhood icons that would require extra protection from unsustainable rents. Their maximum rents would be set by the commission to reflect a reasonable share of their costs of continuing to operate their business, regardless of prevailing market rents in the neighborhood.There will be only a limited number of such icons, and it should be difficult \u2014 indeed very difficult \u2014 to get on the list. But it would certainly help preserve the essential character of our neighborhoods and save essential neighborhood icons like Union Square Cafe. The writer is senior research scholar at the New York University Stern Urbanization Project. To the Editor:Danny Meyer\u2019s article about the imminent move of his restaurant Union Square Cafe because of an inordinately high rent increase dramatizes the plight of all small, locally owned businesses in the face of globalization and gentrification. These restaurants and companies now face the same dangers of rising rents and forced obsolescence as neighborhood shopping streets.As a sociologist, I have spent the last four years leading a transnational research project on local shopping streets in major cities from New York to Shanghai. In each city \u2014 regardless of political and economic differences \u2014 these streets anchor their neighborhoods.They make shopping a social experience; their walkability is both convenient and environmentally sustainable. The small shops and restaurants offer an entry into the mainstream economy for recent immigrants as workers and business owners.Yet no local government directly supports small shops and restaurants. True, cities like Amsterdam do have commissions that mediate commercial, as well as residential, rent disputes. But more often, city governments \u201cupscale\u201d streets to attract affluent shoppers and tourists. A result, as we see around us, is a homogenized landscape of franchise restaurants, bank branches and chain stores.Neither zoning laws nor landmarks designation offers adequate protection against this creeping sameness. Business improvement districts do not see this protection as their mission. What is needed is public policy to protect the social fabric of the street, starting with small, locally owned restaurants and cafes. To the Editor:Rent control will lead to even higher commercial rents, as it will restrict new space coming to market.Take advantage of the free market. Go to another area like Yorkville, where the rent is cheaper than in many neighborhoods of Manhattan and Brooklyn; plenty of people who live there support neighborhood restaurants.To the Editor:Did Danny Meyer ever shed a tear for the affordable neighborhood eateries displaced by his Union Square Cafe and other upscale restaurants and stores? I tend to doubt it. Live by the sword, die by the sword, Mr. Meyer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Control of Senate May Hinge on Georgia Race", "Date": "2014-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Now that David Perdue has emerged as Georgia\u2019s Republican Senate nominee with his runoff victory, the race is shaping up as a battle of two candidates pitching themselves as Washington outsiders: Mr. Perdue, a businessman caricatured by Democrats as a heartless fat cat, and Michelle Nunn, painted by Republicans as a liberal masquerading as a moderate.The contest, which will be one of the most closely watched races of 2014 and one of few where Democrats have hopes of taking a Republican-held seat, could determine control of the Senate. It will play out in a Republican-leaning state where Democrats, citing shifting demographics and an influx of minority voters, believe they can make inroads.\u201cRepublicans just can\u2019t afford to lose it,\u201d said Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, \u201cand Democrats really need to win it.\u201dThat signals an expensive and nasty race, with millions of dollars in spending from outside groups expected.Neither candidate has previously run for public office, and both come from prominent Georgia political families. Mr. Perdue\u2019s cousin Sonny is a two-term former Republican governor. Ms. Nunn\u2019s father, Sam, is a popular former Democratic senator. Mr. Perdue, a former chief executive of Dollar General stores, is known as a turnaround specialist on Wall Street \u2014 prompting Democrats to compare him to Mitt Romney \u2014 and has already poured $3 million of his own money into winning the nomination. Analysts say he will be a tough rival for the cerebral and cautious Ms. Nunn, the former chief executive of the Points of Light Foundation, an organization to promote volunteerism that was inspired by the elder President George Bush.While Ms. Nunn spent the primary season trying to sound bipartisan and stay above the political fray, Mr. Perdue plowed through two brutal races \u2014 a May primary and Tuesday\u2019s runoff \u2014 to beat six other Republicans. So he is battle-tested in a way that Ms. Nunn is not.\u201cYou have two outsiders here, people who\u2019ve never held political office before, but the experience advantage actually goes to Perdue because he had to fight through,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cMichelle Nunn has been running as Democrat-lite \u2014 very lite. So this is going to force her to explain why she\u2019s a Democrat and what policies she supports.\u201dRepublicans plan a strategy of nationalizing the race. They will try to tie Ms. Nunn to President Obama and make the case that a vote for her is a vote to keep Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, in charge of the Senate. Eric J. Tanenblatt, who was Mr. Romney\u2019s 2012 Georgia finance chairman, said efforts to paint Mr. Perdue as heartless would not work.\u201cDemocrats saw in the last presidential election that issue was used against Mitt Romney,\u201d Mr. Tanenblatt said. \u201cBut Georgia is a conservative state and we value in Georgia hard work, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with someone who is successful.\u201dStill, Democrats are trying \u2014 with help from Mr. Perdue\u2019s primary challengers, who have supplied ammunition. On Wednesday, after Mr. Perdue secured his runoff victory over Representative Jack Kingston, an 11-term congressman, the Georgia Democratic Party released Internet video clips from a blistering Republican primary debate. In it, Mr. Kingston ridiculed Mr. Perdue for living in a \u201cgated community,\u201d while Representative Phil Gingrey, a former challenger, went after him for his management of Pillowtex, a North Carolina company that closed, leading to layoffs of 4,000 workers, after Mr. Perdue briefly served as its chief executive.\u201cYou once again hit the gold mine, and the poor employees got the shaft,\u201d Mr. Gingrey said in the debate. In Washington, Democrats said Georgia voters could expect to hear more of such talk.\u201cHe\u2019s out of touch, he\u2019s out for himself and we\u2019re going to make that case,\u201d said Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee here. \u201cWhen you contrast that with someone whose life has been spent in a different kind of public service, in a charitable organization, that\u2019s a contest we\u2019re very comfortable with.\u201dDemocrats are also hoping that Mr. Perdue will stumble in taking on a female candidate \u2014 and on Wednesday, they were already proffering evidence that he had, citing a remark reported by The Associated Press in which he sounded dismissive of Ms. Nunn\u2019s work. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about debt, the economy and jobs and who brings more value to that debate,\u201d the news service quoted Mr. Perdue as saying. \u201cSomeone who has been running a philanthropy for 15 years or whatever, or someone who has been out here, not to go bragging, competing in the real world?\u201dBoth candidates spent Wednesday trying to pivot toward November. Mr. Perdue, who has already won Mr. Kingston\u2019s endorsement, turned up at the Georgia Republican Party headquarters, where the party chairman, John Padgett, told reporters that Republicans were unified around the nominee. Ms. Nunn dropped in on an Atlanta diner, and then began a four-day campaign swing in Athens, Ga., where she told supporters she would \u201ccontinue to talk about how we need to change the dysfunction in Washington through civility and collaboration.\u201dHer campaign also staged a \u201cmoney bomb\u201d fund-raising blitz; Nunn backers including Hank Aaron and a string of Democratic senators, among them Michael Bennet of Colorado and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, sent emails to supporters urging them to donate. With $4.5 million in the bank, Ms. Nunn has already proved to be a prolific fund-raiser, but experts say each side will need at least $10 million. One outside political action committee, the Ending Spending Action Fund, has already spent $900,000 on an attack ad against Ms. Nunn. Called \u201cDesperate,\u201d it asks voters why Mr. Obama is \u201cdesperate for Michelle Nunn to be our senator\u201d and accuses her of earning \u201cas much $300,000 running a nonprofit that had laid off 90 workers.\u201dIf there is a path to victory for Ms. Nunn, it will be by increasing minority turnout while courting independent-minded whites, especially young voters and women. Since 2000, the white share of the electorate in the state has dropped to 59 percent from 72 percent, and 48 percent of those newly eligible nonwhite voters are black, the most reliable Democratic constituency.But Mr. Black, the political scientist, said much would depend on how she performed in debates against Mr. Perdue, adding, \u201cShe\u2019s got to elevate her game.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Right now Germany is trying to fill 117,000 jobs in science, technology and engineering, a gap that may widen to as many as one million by 2020, according to the Cologne Institute for Economic Research.So Germany, once a relatively homogeneous society that long struggled to assimilate immigrants and refugees from Turkey and other relatively poor countries, is competing more aggressively with the United States, Britain and other nations to attract and keep educated people from abroad who can help crucial industries. Since 2005, but especially over the past three to five years, Germany has eased rules recognizing foreign qualifications, granting residence permits for skilled foreigners and in depicting Germany as a land of migration.\u201cImmigrants,\u201d noted Axel Pl\u00fcnnecke, a professor at the Cologne Institute who specializes in the effects of the population gap, \u201care really important to fill the shortage of workers.\u201d There is now \u201ca political consensus that immigration helps Germany and is really good and useful,\u201d he said.Given its status as the largest economy in Europe, Germany is also attracting the most immigrants \u2014 a record net gain of 400,000 last year. Typically, according to the Berlin Institute for Population and Development, 35 percent of immigrants are now more likely to have a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree, compared with 20 percent of Germans.Germany is still sending some mixed signals about immigration. This month the European Court of Justice ruled against a provision of the country\u2019s immigration law that required the spouses of Turkish immigrants to show proficiency in German before they could qualify for a visa.Reiner Klingholz, head of the Berlin Institute, said Germany still had work to do to attract foreigners. \u201cGermany has to position itself still more strongly as a land of immigration and make its \u2018welcome culture\u2019 a matter of course,\u201d he said.Among the group of six foreigners studying German with Ms. Torres at a city-run college in central Berlin, the only one who voiced some hesitation about the welcome she had received was Pilar Okenve Ramos, 34, who was born in Spain and whose father hails from Equatorial Guinea. She is finishing her doctorate in biochemistry and moved to Berlin to be with her boyfriend, who works for Transparency International, an anticorruption organization.\u201cI\u2019m black, I\u2019m Spanish and a woman,\u201d Ms. Ramos said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had any problem. I would like to stay here. I really like this place, but I think they need to change a little bit.\u201d She was reluctant to elaborate, but eventually made it clear that some foreign friends and acquaintances of African origin had experienced prejudice. She phrased it this way: \u201cThey need us, but we see that some part of the people here don\u2019t see that.\u201dEveryone else in the group \u2014 an Israeli artist, a Spanish graphic designer, a Russian Tatar lawyer here for breast cancer treatment, Ms. Torres, and a Parisian woman who had abandoned the multinational corporate life in Bangkok to make experimental music \u2014 expressed positive views of Germany, noting that Berlin, as the capital, is cosmopolitan but still relatively cheap. All said they could manage everyday life speaking English, but felt that German would be needed if they really wanted to make a life here. Most pay up to 150 euros, or about $200, for a 10-week course, meeting five times a week, for four hours a day.In Germany\u2019s effort to lure foreigners, there have been some mishaps. In the spring, news reports chronicled the plight of 128 Spaniards lured at their own expense to the eastern city of Erfurt by a private agency, which did little beyond putting them up in dormitory-like conditions in a former East German job-training center. Most of them were eventually absorbed by government-run programs.A government program started last year to try to attract people \u2014 particularly young southern Europeans \u2014 to jobs in hotels, catering or caring for the older people, ran into problems in April.Some 9,000 people had applied for financial assistance under the program, around half from Spain. Alarmed that the government had no money, the Labor Ministry hastily sent letters urging patience to applicants.Eventually, the ministry said it had secured financial aid for all those who applied before April 8. Rules for 2015 to 2018 are still being negotiated, but Germany, the only European Union member offering such a program, is now set to spend about $760 million, more than four times the originally budgeted amount, the Labor Ministry said.A study prepared for the federal migration office suggested that about 20,000 Spaniards moved to Germany from 2011 to 2013. Figures for Greece and Portugal, both also hit hard during the euro crisis, are thought to be similar.Germany, famed for its system of combining work experience with academic study, is seeking to extend that approach to immigrants. But officials say they are worried that 20 percent of Germany\u2019s pupils leave school without qualifications needed for an apprenticeship, with anecdotal evidence suggesting many of them have a Turkish or other migrant background.The Association of German Employers said it had tried since 2004 to ensure 60,000 new job openings with training in 30,000 enterprises of all sizes. With the economy still growing, those goals have been exceeded, but for the past six years there have been more apprentice jobs available than qualified candidates to fill them. Nationwide, unemployment is 5.2 percent, compared with 11.8 percent over all in the 18-nation eurozone.Among the biggest trainers are the engineering giant Siemens, Germany\u2019s famed automakers, the state railway network Deutsche Bahn and the telecommunications specialist Deutsche Telekom. To know what they are getting in a hire, these companies mostly need to train in Germany, noted Professor Pl\u00fcnnecke. About 85 percent of the nearly $300 million that Siemens spends annually training workers is spent in Germany, where some 10,000 people a year enter dual tracks for on-the-job experience combined with a bachelor\u2019s degree, said Michael Friedrich, a Siemens spokesman.But Siemens has started similar programs in the United States and Britain, he said. Some 1,000 young people a year from Siemens plants in Britain, Hungary and Spain come for training in Germany, and the company selects 30 promising Europeans a year for a three-and-a-half-year program that involves a final exam in German before the trainees return to Siemens jobs at home. In all, Siemens employs 360,000 people worldwide, with fewer than half (117,000) in Germany.Over all, the interchange of skills and labor \u2014 particularly in higher-end jobs \u2014 and the fact that some 30 percent of the 650,000 to 700,000 births a year in Germany are to immigrants mean that one of every two new German citizens has foreign roots, Professor Pl\u00fcnnecke said.Whether all of the job opportunity and greater openness to foreigners will add up to a completely new life for Cristina Torres is unclear. Her daughter, though, is prepared. \u201cAlready, she says only \u2018tsch\u00fcss,\u2019\u00a0\u201d German for \u201cbye bye,\u201d Ms. Torres said. \u201cShe forgot \u2018hola\u2019 and \u2018adios.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poised to Gain in Iraq Crisis, Kurds Face New Barriers to Autonomy", "Date": "2014-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byERBIL, Iraq \u2014 Gasoline stocks in the Kurdish region are running low, requiring rationing and hourslong waits for a fill-up. Hundreds of thousands of civil servants have gone months without a paycheck after Baghdad cut payments to the regional government in retaliation for its exporting oil without permission.At the same time, a tanker filled with Kurdish oil has been stranded for more than a month off the coast of Morocco, prevented from unloading its lucrative cargo because of pressure from United States diplomats and threats by officials in Baghdad that any buyer would face legal challenges.On the surface, these would appear to be heady days for the Kurds, who seem closer than ever to attaining their centuries-old dream of statehood. With Iraq\u2019s Shiite-dominated government reeling after an assault by Islamic militants, the autonomous Kurdish region has seized control of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and has begun preparations for a referendum on independence.But that drive for statehood is presenting a new set of problems. Unable either to sell its abundant oil supplies abroad or refine them for its own use, the Kurdish regional government has seen its once-thriving economy stall.Now, powerful forces, not just in Baghdad, are lining up against Kurdish sovereignty, and even some Kurdish officials on a visit to Washington this week said they recognized that their quest might have to be delayed.With a population that sprawls across four nations \u2014 Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran \u2014 the Kurds have historically been stymied in their pursuit of independence by the conflicting needs and desires of those parent states, and before them the Ottoman Empire.Yet the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States seemed to provide an opening for the Kurds. They formed a highly effective fighting force, the pesh merga, to defend their territory and developed their own energy sources with an eye to achieving economic independence. Their economy boomed.Kurdish leaders worked to slowly expand the region\u2019s autonomy, carefully avoiding any outright breach with Baghdad. When militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria invaded Iraq this spring, the Kurds seemed well positioned to increase their influence, and perhaps even declare themselves an independent state.But now bigger powers are raising objections. The United States, for one, is pressuring the Kurds to remain a part of Iraq and join in a national unity government that it sees as a starting point for dealing with the current crisis. Even Turkey, an important economic partner that has helped the Kurds export some of their oil, is against outright independence, fearing that would inflame separatist sentiments in the substantial Kurdish population within its own borders.The only country in the Middle East that has rallied to the Kurdish cause has been Israel, which historically has had close, albeit covert, ties to the Kurds, seeing them as rare friends in a hostile region. Yet in a part of the world that is deeply antagonistic to Israel, that association is problematic for the Kurds.In the end, though, even as the rise of ISIS has accelerated the Kurds\u2019 drive for independence, their surest route to economic self-sufficiency and statehood is to export their own oil. But to achieve that, they will have to overcome a number of diplomatic and legal roadblocks.Sitting on a sea of oil, the Kurds have already attracted major investments from energy giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Regional oil experts say Kurdistan can now move 60,000 to 100,000 barrels a day of its own oil through a new pipeline to Turkey. Before that, oil had to travel by truck to Turkey, which has signed long-term energy agreements \u2014 deemed illegal by Baghdad and the United States \u2014 worth billions of dollars.The victories gained by the militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria were built on months of maneuvering along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.Additional drilling and the repair of a major northern Iraqi pipeline that has been repeatedly sabotaged could enable Kurdistan to export a million barrels a day, making it a world-class producer. But so far, the Kurds have been unable to sell much of the oil that they have managed to transport to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, on the Mediterranean coast, as buyers have been scared off by potential legal challenges.At least four tankers, including the one lingering off the coast of Morocco, have been loaded with Kurdish oil at the port in Ceyhan, but only one, oil industry executives say, has found a buyer \u2014 an unidentified Israeli entity.Even before the current crisis, the United States opposed the Kurds\u2019 exporting their own oil, fearing that could lead to the breakup of Iraq.\u201cU.S. policy has not changed,\u201d said David Goldwyn, who was the State Department\u2019s special envoy and coordinator for international energy affairs in the first Obama administration. Referring to the Kurdistan regional government, he added, \u201cU.S. policy remains: preserve the territorial integrity of Iraq, promote a political unity among the three major factions and oppose the K.R.G. flouting that unity by marketing its oil over Baghdad\u2019s objections.\u201dThe call by Massoud Barzani, the region\u2019s president, for a referendum on independence has also found little international support, backed only by the Israeli leaders Benjamin Netanyahu and Shimon Peres.\u201cAs soon as Barzani made that threat and Netanyahu and Shimon Peres echoed that, you heard Turkey say they do not want an independent state in Kurdistan, and the United States saying that as well,\u201d Mr. Goldwyn said. \u201cSo I think the K.R.G.\u2019s future lies in a strong economic relationship with Turkey, and if Turkey is opposed to independence, then independence will not produce the outcome they seek.\u201dThere are signs, however, that the talk of a referendum on independence may have been a bargaining tactic. On Thursday, top Kurdish officials visited Washington, suggesting that they were still willing to consider a political settlement that would keep the region within a unified Iraq in exchange for more autonomy and more concessions on oil.They also acknowledged the budget crisis they are facing, not to mention the severe fuel shortages. \u201cWe need support and help,\u201d Fuad Hussein, Mr. Barzani\u2019s chief of staff, said this week at an event in Washington hosted by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cWe\u2019re not receiving money from Baghdad anymore, so we need financial resources.\u201dMr. Hussein said he thought the Obama administration was reconsidering its policy toward Kurdistan\u2019s increasing demands for more autonomy, if not outright sovereignty. \u201cWe feel they are ready to listen,\u201d he said.So far, though, the administration has been steadfast about preventing Iraq from breaking up, though analysts say it might be open to increased autonomy.With Kurdish oil flowing through the new pipeline to Turkey, though, some analysts fear the debate over independence is in danger of being decided by facts on the ground.Months ago, American diplomats felt they had put together a deal in which oil revenues would be held by the Central Bank of Iraq in an account in New York. But that fell through because the Turks insisted the money be put in an escrow account in Halkbank, a Turkish state-run bank that has been at the center of a corruption scandal.Whatever the eventual outcome, the Kurdish region seems to be facing hard times, at least until the immediate crisis has passed, because few major energy companies are willing to invest heavily in the area until they are convinced they will have a trouble-free way to market the oil.\u201cOil companies are very wary about touching what is considered a hot commodity,\u201d said Denise Natali, an expert on Kurdish affairs at the National Defense University in Washington. \u201cThese kinds of small-scale exports can\u2019t add up to meet their financial needs. The Kurds don\u2019t have the pipeline, the storage capacity, the political support or the legal recognition to assure large scale, consistent, risk-free exports.\u201dTim Arango reported from Erbil and Istanbul, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Income Inequality and the Ills Behind It", "Date": "2014-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIs it time to stop obsessing about inequality?Perhaps it was President Obama\u2019s speech last December, calling the nation\u2019s vast income gap \u201cthe defining challenge of our time.\u201d The American publication of the French economist Thomas Piketty\u2019s blockbuster \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d must have helped.Some find support in the ant and the grasshopper. As one reader articulated in a recent email: \u201cThose who deserve to be poor should be poor. Those who desire to be rich should be rich. That is what justice looks like.\u201dStill, aside from these extreme views, the critique does add up to a coherent argument: The income gap cleaving society between the rich and the rest may, in fact, be a red herring.It is not only that the accumulation of income at the apex of the pyramid of success is not the nation\u2019s main problem. There is little we can do to redress it anyway.\u201cThe returns to growth are going to people in other countries, most notably China, and generally to people with high I.Q., no matter where they live,\u201d said Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University and a contributor to the Economic View column in The New York Times. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how you could undermine this dynamic, short of wrecking the world. Trying to deny that logic is going to fail or worse, backfire.\u201dMr. Cowen, who describes himself as a libertarian with a lowercase \u201cl,\u201d is the author of \u201cAverage Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation,\u201d (Dutton, 2013), which posits that technology and globalization have essentially split the labor market in two: high and low earners. Far fewer stable jobs are left over in the middle to support what through much of the 20th century we called the middle class.In his view, the defining challenge of our era is that workers in the bottom half of the distribution can no longer trust that their living standard will double every generation. \u201cThe right moral question is \u2018are poor people rising to a higher standard of living?\u2019 Inequality itself is the wrong thing to look at,\u201d he told me. The real problem is slow growth.There are nuances to this narrative. N. Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist who was a top economic adviser to President George W. Bush and the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, contends it would be better to live in a less lopsided society. \u201cMore equality does probably mean greater social and political harmony,\u201d he told me.Mr. Cowen does not buy that, recalling his frequent trips to New York in the 1970s, when it was much more equal yet much less harmonious.But otherwise the analyses and the prescriptions are similar: Technological progress has benefited well-educated workers with skills that are not easily automated and who can profitably deploy advances in technology. It has undercut less skilled workers whose jobs could be performed cheaply with software or machines.\u201cThe best way to address rising inequality is to focus on increasing educational attainment,\u201d Professor Mankiw said. Mr. Cowen adds other potentially useful policies, like expanding the earned-income tax credit or using urban policy to, say, make it easier for people who are not rich to live in San Francisco.And neither Mr. Cowen nor Mr. Mankiw seems hopeful that the inequality dial will move significantly. \u201cPolicies that address the symptom rather than the cause include higher taxes and a more generous social safety net,\u201d Mr. Mankiw said. \u201cThe magnitude of what we can plausibly do with these policy tools is small compared to the size of the growing income gap.\u201dMr. Cowen put it this way: \u201cWe might take people who grow up poor and stay poor and turn them into the equivalent of a midlevel carpenter. We would have a better country. We would have less crime. But it wouldn\u2019t change the global distribution of gains.\u201dIs the right right?In fact, not that long ago, much of Mr. Mankiw\u2019s and Mr. Cowen\u2019s analysis was shared across the political spectrum.As inequality increased during the 1990s, President Bill Clinton proposed education \u2014 rather than redistribution \u2014 as the preferred prescription.So what happened? For starters, the concentration of income at the top has become even more pronounced than it was during the Clinton administration. At the same time, Supreme Court rulings allowing a rush of private money into political campaigns have underscored how plutocracy could purchase the policies it wants to maintain its privilege, locking inequity in forever.What is more, workers with a college education may still earn substantially more than those without one. But the incomes of workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree have barely grown over the last four decades.\u201cEducation isn\u2019t doing it,\u201d said Timothy Smeeding, an economist at the University of Wisconsin.Which gets to the nub of the issue, even for those most interested in defending the advantages of free-market capitalism. As the richest Americans capture a larger and larger share of the fruits of growth, for many people the essential economic question becomes: What is the point of creating a larger pie?\u201cAs long as all the boats are rising that gives us some hope,\u201d Professor Smeeding said. \u201cThe problem is that the middle class isn\u2019t getting that. That\u2019s the post-Great Recession reality.\u201dEmail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
