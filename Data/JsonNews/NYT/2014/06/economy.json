You emerge from a nap in your wine cellar or from a month in a submarine to find that during your absence, civilization has been destroyed, and only you, and perhaps a few other people, are left alive. You\u2019re panicky. Grief stricken. Bummed. Full of impotent rage. Perhaps even a little gleeful.Eric Dane of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d is in command, and he and the sailors and scientists on the ship have a lot to think about once they figure out that a virus has killed practically everyone while they\u2019ve been away. Let\u2019s hope they have a substantial television archive onboard, because they can learn a lot about how to deal with this situation from past series. Television has been ending the world almost since the medium was invented, with a new annihilation coming along seemingly every other year. (Movies have, too, of course, but we have limited space, so we\u2019ll stick with television.) Here are lessons that five post-apocalyptic shows of yore offer those on \u201cThe Last Ship\u201d as they start their journey into the brave new largely empty world:\u201cThe Last Train\u201d was also on the cutting edge when it came to accounting for the existence of survivors. The lucky few are passengers in a rail car that is buried in a tunnel by the blast. One of them happens to be carrying a canister of something that cryogenically freezes everyone in the car. Upon waking, the groggy travelers don\u2019t realize that decades have passed. When they hear barking, some think rescue dogs are on the way and rush toward them. Turns out they\u2019re not rescue dogs; they\u2019re just hungry dogs. A rather gruesome scene follows. The people on \u201cThe Last Ship\u201d should take note, because early in the premiere, as the destroyer is departing on its mission, it takes some sort of search dog aboard. \u201cHe\u2019s a mean operator,\u201d his handler tells a sailor. Uh-oh.This British series ran for three seasons beginning in 1975 and was created by Terry Nation, whose long list of writing credits includes \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and \u201cThe Avengers.\u201d Britain quickly degenerates into preindustrial ugliness when a virus kills most of humanity. (This virus appears to recur every 33 years; the series was remade in 2008.) \u201cWhat are they for?\u201d another asks.\u201cRats,\u201d he replies. \u201cThe noise helps to keep them off.\u201d Guess what the scientists aboard \u201cThe Last Ship\u201d bring along? Rodents. They look like mice, but still: Uh-oh.The destruction of the world is a discombobulating event, and in its immediate aftermath, you\u2019re going to need to make sure you don\u2019t take anything for granted. The first thing not to take for granted is that world destruction has indeed occurred.\u201cNow, look,\u201d he says about 12 minutes into the pilot, \u201cthis could have been a test, could have been an accident. There\u2019s military bases near Denver. One explosion does not make an attack.\u201dOf course, the mayor should also have known that one explosion does not generally make a post-apocalyptic network series; it soon becomes apparent that cities all over the United States have been nuked. But the point is, \u201cThe Last Ship\u201d crew should make sure that global extinction really is underway. Going all end-of-days when the problem turns out merely to be a global case of sniffles would be embarrassing.That first \u201cJericho\u201d episode offered another lesson in the importance of being sure. The sheriff and a deputy go out in search of a school bus that has not returned from a field trip. And they do find a crashed bus. But they don\u2019t make sure it\u2019s a school bus before boarding. Turns out it\u2019s a prison bus, and the inmates on it are now free and armed. Uh-oh. A spare what? A spare of whatever it is that is most important to you or makes your life worth living. Because once the world is destroyed, the service economy is going to be shot. Try getting a repairman, a replacement part or a response from a consumer help line when everyone is dead.He\u2019s briefly excited because now he\u2019ll be able to read all day, every day. Then he breaks his glasses. If he\u2019d had a spare pair, not a problem. But he apparently doesn\u2019t. Uh-oh. This legendarily terrible series from the early days of the Fox network (1992) had the chutzpah to treat the end of the world as comedy. A nuclear misunderstanding kills all but a few people, who wind up sharing a cabin. The bombs have for some reason left all of them with white streaks in their hair. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why So Many World Cup Fans Dislike Argentina", "Date": "2014-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Global GameBut if the Argentine team is feared by many fans, it certainly is not loved. To put it bluntly, many people can\u2019t stand the thought of an Argentine World Cup title.The dislike seems to stem from Argentina\u2019s soccer history and the way in which neighbors in Latin America have reacted to how some Argentines projected their perceptions of economic and cultural superiority in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that a lot of people despise Argentina in the world of football,\u201d said Christopher Gaffney, a scholar at the Fluminense Federal University here, who studies large sporting events.Despite recent economic troubles, the country also has a legacy of ranking among the richest in the region. In the 1990s, when the currency was stronger than those in neighboring countries, some Argentine tourists were notorious for their braggadocio.\u201cFor many years, Argentina\u2019s economy was the strongest in the region, and there was a strong European influence; that built an image of superiority,\u201d said Leandro Morgenfeld, a historian at the University of Buenos Aires. \u201cThe sectors of society that regional neighbors most came into contact with were those projecting that arrogance.\u201dHistorians of soccer and politics in Latin America attribute some of the animosity to the ways in which some Argentines have traditionally viewed their nation, which received millions of European immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries: as a dominion of racial pre-eminence in the region.On the streets of Argentina\u2019s capital, views differ as to why the national team isn\u2019t popular with other Latin Americans. Daniel Gonz\u00e1lez, 29, a television producer who moved to Buenos Aires 10 years ago from Colombia, said the stereotypes of Argentines in his home nation were misguided.\u201cThey have a reputation for arrogance,\u201d Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cBut when you arrive here, you see it\u2019s not that bad.\u201dStill, many Argentina do exude brazen pride. \u201cThey\u2019re jealous of us,\u201d Eduardo Gangi, 60, who runs a corner store in Buenos Aires, said of Argentina\u2019s neighbors. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly taking over the world. We sent a queen to Holland and a pope to the Vatican,\u201d he said, referring to Queen M\u00e1xima of the Netherlands, the Argentine-born wife of King Willem-Alexander, and Pope Francis.Despite such views, Argentina\u2019s political ties with its neighbors, especially Brazil, are much warmer than in previous decades, marked by the endurance of Mercosur, the South American trading bloc. Mr. Morgenfeld, the Argentine historian, warned against using opinions voiced ahead of the World Cup to interpret the wider cultural context.\u201cSoccer and culture are two different tracks,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Latin American unity is strong, but soccer creates divisions.\u201dThat tension emerges in different ways, with many people in Latin America rooting against Argentina, and many Argentines expressing ire against their neighbors.For instance, at a warm-up match for the World Cup in Buenos Aires last week, a group of Argentine fans outside the stadium sang about its hatred of Chile. They singled out Chilean support of Britain during the Falklands War of 1982, when Argentina unsuccessfully sought to establish sovereignty over a group of islands in the South Atlantic called the Falklands by the British and the Malvinas by Argentines.\u201cAll I ask from God is for all Chileans to die,\u201d the Argentines chanted. \u201cThe betrayal of the Malvinas will never be forgotten.\u201dWORLD CUP BRAZIL; The Turtle Weighs In: By eating a fish hung from a Brazilian flag, the\n25-year-old loggerhead turtle Big Head predicted\nthat Brazil will beat Croatia in the opening game of\nthe World Cup on Thursday.; The Upshot: The Upshot provides news,\nanalysis and graphics about\npolitics, policy and everyday life.\nnytimes.com/upshotAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boehner to Seek Bill to Sue Obama Over Executive Actions", "Date": "2014-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker John A. Boehner announced Wednesday that he would introduce legislation next month allowing the House to sue President Obama over his use of executive actions.\u201cThe Constitution makes it clear that a president\u2019s job is to faithfully execute the laws; in my view, the president has not faithfully executed the laws,\u201d Mr. Boehner told reporters. \u201cAnd when there\u2019s conflicts like this between the legislative branch and the administrative branch it\u2019s, in my view, our responsibility to stand up for this institution in which we serve.\u201dRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, called Mr. Boehner\u2019s move \u201csubterfuge,\u201d and Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that \u201cit seems that Republicans have shifted their opposition into a higher gear.\u201d\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a gear that I didn\u2019t know previously existed,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cThe fact that they are considering a taxpayer-funded lawsuit against the president of the United States for doing his job, I think, is the kind of step that most Americans wouldn\u2019t support.\u201dHouse Speaker John A. Boehner sent this memo to members of the House of Representatives, outlining plans for the chamber to sue President Obama for allegedly exceeding the lawful scope of his executive powers.Mr. Boehner said the bill would allow the House to file suit through the House general counsel and at the direction of the chamber\u2019s Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group. In 2011, Mr. Boehner convened the group after the White House decided it would stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which prevented same-sex couples who were married under their state\u2019s laws from receiving federal marriage benefits. The House eventually spent $2.3 million defending that law, but the Supreme Court struck it down as unconstitutional last year.The president has used his executive authority to carry out key elements of his second-term agenda, like halting the deportation of young illegal immigrants brought to the country by their parents as children, raising the minimum wage for employees of federal contractors, and allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to curb carbon emissions from coal plants.Mr. Boehner said the lawsuit would not be a prelude to impeachment proceedings, and was not an attempt to rally the Republican base before the midterm elections.\u201cI believe the House must act as an institution to defend the constitutional principles at stake and to protect our system of government and our economy from continued executive abuse,\u201d he said in the letter. \u201cThe president has an obligation to faithfully execute the laws of our country.\u201dThe nation did not elect \u201ca monarch or king,\u201d he added.Courts have also generally been reluctant to intervene in separation-of-powers disputes between the executive and legislative branches of government, preferring to let them work out such questions using constitutional tools, like lawmakers\u2019 power of the purse.Charlie Savage contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Re-Evaluating the College Rankings Game", "Date": "2014-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationThis fall, U.S. News and World Report, which published its first list of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Colleges\u201d back in 1983, will release its first guide to higher education in the Arab world. In December, Times Higher Education, which already publishes world rankings, separate Asian rankings and rankings based solely on reputation, announced a new list devoted to universities in the so-called BRIC countries \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 and other emerging economies. QS, meanwhile, which publishes its own world rankings and numerous regional rankings, also now ranks universities by specific subjects \u2014 a list that, perhaps unsurprisingly, suggests that Oxford and Cambridge are the best places to study English literature while the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford are better for computer science.So who will rank the rankings? That was the inescapable question when representatives of the four leading ranking organizations sat on the same panel at a conference here last month.As Bob Morse, the research director for U.S. News and World Report, pointed out, rankings have become a fiercely competitive global business.So the presence of Mr. Morse; Phil Baty, editor of the Times Higher Education Rankings; Nian Cai Lui, originator of the Academic Ranking of World Universities (better known as the Shanghai rankings); and Ben Sowter of the QS World University Rankings would have been enough to make the gathering \u201ca historic event,\u201d Mr. Morse said.But in addition to trading friendly digs at their competitors\u2019 methodologies, the rankers had to listen to some stinging criticism \u2014 not just from disgruntled academics complaining that their institutions have been undervalued, or education ministers responding to an absence of their country\u2019s universities on a given list, but from their own invited guests. Even the conference host, Michael Arthur, the president of University College London, took a jab.Noting that the auditorium where the participants assembled was on the land that once made up Charles Darwin\u2019s garden, Mr. Arthur said that while he was proud to lead an institution that had done well in the rankings, he didn\u2019t set much store by the numerous surveys that institutions were continually being asked to fill out. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of self-reporting,\u201d he said.Rachel Schroeder, in charge of employment marketing for Airbus in France, said she found rankings of little use because \u201cthere is no ranking that takes diversity into consideration.\u201d She said she saw recruiting a diverse work force as a crucial part of her job.Christian Schutz, the head of university relations for Siemens, the electronics company, said rankings had little impact on his company\u2019s hiring decisions. For a conference on the theme of \u201cEmployability and Academic Rankings,\u201d this was hardly an on-message contribution.\u201cEurope is not very present. If you look at any of the lists of top 25 universities, you might find ETH Zurich,\u201d Mr. Schutz said, referring to the Swiss technical university: \u201cBut nothing from France, Germany, Spain.\u201cYet these are all societies where higher education is very highly valued,\u201d he continued, \u201cand where it really doesn\u2019t matter so much where a student comes from. They are able to do the work.\u201dRankings, Mr. Schutz suggested, only really mattered in unequal societies \u2014 where that inequality is reflected in the system of higher education. \u201cIf we think about Scandinavia, rankings are not so relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we think about India, rankings are extremely relevant. In lots of Indian universities people graduate without a sufficient level of English. There is a quality problem.\u201dChristina Steensboe, a researcher at the Technical University of Denmark, agreed that rankings had little impact in the Nordic countries, where universities were financed by tax revenues and did not charge tuition. \u201cMy university is ranked highest in Denmark for engineering, and we\u2019re proud of that,\u201d said Ms. Steensboe. \u201cBut people usually just go to whichever university is nearest to where they live \u2014 or which specializes in specific courses like law or medicine.\u201dThe conference, which was sponsored by the rankings company QS and the International Rankings Expert Group, a nonprofit organization of ranking groups and universities from Eastern Europe, China and some countries of the former Soviet Union, devoted several sessions to attempts to connect rankings to the global job market. Proposals included regular surveys of students at six-month, one-year and 10-year intervals after graduation.Ms. Engle also questioned whether a single rating system could serve both consumers and government officials wanting to hold schools accountable.Mr. Holmes, who teaches at Universiti Teknologi MARA in Malaysia, said that once schools knew they were being graded on graduation rates, or on the proportion of their students eligible for Pell grants, those statistics could be manipulated.\u201cWhen any sort of high-stakes testing regime carries economic consequences, the temptation to cheat increases,\u201d Mr. Holmes said in an interview at the conference.Angela Yung Chi Hou, from the Higher Education Evaluation & Accreditation Council of Taiwan, said that government rankings also created political problems.\u201cWe tried to develop a ranking just for our own universities,\u201d she said. \u201cBut several institutions complained that if you don\u2019t have a medical program or a lot of scientific research you\u2019re at a disadvantage. They were afraid their funding would be affected. And they argued that as an accrediting body we shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201dAs a result, Ms. Hou said, the government of Taiwan got out of the ranking business and went back to using existing commercial rankings to determine financing allocations, and suitable partners for institutional collaborations or for student exchanges. \u201cNow we can pretend we\u2019re not paying attention. This is the game we play,\u201d she added.Han Soo Kim, from Sejong University in Korea, said that as the birthrate in his country had declined, \u201cuniversities have to fight for students.\u201dThe Korean government grades all universities on a scale from A to D, he said: \u201cThose with A grades can keep their entry numbers. Those with D grades have to reduce their admissions by 30 percent.\u201dMeanwhile, the current system has allowed private ranking organizations such as QS and Times Higher Education to grow and prosper, despite concerns, Mr. Holmes said, that they operate in \u201ca world where there\u2019s not really a clear line between the poachers and the gamekeepers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As in Past, Underdog Goal Is to Exploit Divisive Party", "Date": "2014-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneWith a ticket led by State Senators Wendy Davis of Fort Worth and Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio, Democrats are hoping to break a political drought that has lasted since 1998, the last time a member of their party held statewide office. Republicans know how they feel. Despite Texas\u2019 deep conservative reputation, it was not long ago that the situation was reversed, with Democrats dominating Texas politics while Republicans were widely viewed as permanent also-rans. But that changed in 1961, when a political science professor from Wichita Falls defied conventional wisdom and was elected to the United States Senate, the first Texas Republican to win a statewide seat since Reconstruction. The way the candidate, John Tower, managed the feat, and started his party\u2019s fitful journey toward sweeping all major state offices 37 years later, offers a glimpse at the challenges now facing Democrats, and the reasons Republicans are taking the current threat to their nearly two-decade winning streak seriously. Still, Ms. Davis and Ms. Van de Putte are considered long shots and will need, much like Mr. Tower did, a host of variables to settle in their favor to win.\u201cIf you look at other red states all across the country, they have the occasional Democratic governor, the occasional United States senator who is a Democrat,\u201d said Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare for a party to have complete control.\u201d (S.M.U. is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)In the years before Mr. Tower\u2019s win, the Democrats\u2019 control of Texas was nearly absolute. They held every statewide office and most local positions.By the 1950s, the Texas Democratic Party encapsulated such a wide range of views that the party label had begun to lose its meaning, said Sean Cunningham, an associate professor of history at Texas Tech University.\u201cFor a long time, conservative Democrats would vote Democrat at the local level and Republican at the national level,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said.As conservative as Texas is today, Republicans are still not as dominant as Democrats were in the first half of the last century. Democrats currently control more than 35 percent of the seats in the Legislature and make up about a third of the state\u2019s congressional delegation. From 1900 to 1950, the number of Texas Republicans in the Legislature or Congress was negligible.Yet Republican voters in Texas are also less divided today than Democrats were in the 1950s. Along with Republicans controlling all statewide offices, the state\u2019s voters have consistently backed the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee since 1980.Mr. Tower first ran for Senate in 1960, when he unsuccessfully challenged the Democrat, Lyndon B. Johnson, who was running simultaneously for re-election and as John F. Kennedy\u2019s running mate on the presidential ticket. The next year, Mr. Johnson became vice president and vacated his Senate seat. A conservative Democrat, William Blakley, was appointed to fill the seat until a special election could be held. Among a field of about 70 candidates from across the political spectrum, Mr. Tower and Mr. Blakley advanced to a runoff in which Mr. Tower courted \u201cindependent-thinking Texans\u201d and \u201cdisillusioned Democrats.\u201dProminent Democrats endorsed Mr. Tower largely as a protest vote against Mr. Blakley, whom they viewed as insufficiently liberal.\u201cMany of them voted for John Tower to teach the conservative Democrats a lesson,\u201d Dr. Jillson said. \u201cIt just shows how badly the Texas Democratic Party was broken.\u201dMr. Tower won with 51 percent of the vote. Richard Murray, a political science professor at the University of Houston, said the victory gave the Texas Republican Party newfound credibility. \u201cWhen you\u2019re losing, you\u2019ll take a fluke because it signals, \u2018Hey, we can win,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dr. Murray said. (U.H. is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.) \u201cLogically, at some point you can get too far to the right and you start endangering your ability to win more moderate Republicans,\u201d Dr. Murray said. \u201cThe test of that will be in the lieutenant governor\u2019s race.\u201dIndeed, Ms. Van de Putte is focusing much of her campaign\u2019s efforts on painting her Republican opponent, State Senator Dan Patrick of Houston, as a right-wing ideologue who would harm the state\u2019s economy if he were elected to the state\u2019s second-highest post. Her campaign has rolled out endorsements from business leaders who think Mr. Patrick\u2019s stances on social issues go too far. But the Texas Association of Business, the state\u2019s main business advocacy group, said it would probably support Mr. Patrick in the general election, even though it opposed him in the Republican primary.Even if Democrats manage to end the Republican stranglehold on statewide offices this year, history suggests the state will remain conservative, Dr. Cunningham, the Texas Tech University professor, said.\u201cThe process of political realignment in Texas did not take place overnight,\u201d Dr. Cunningham said. \u201cThe process of realignment was slow. It was painstaking. It was a roller coaster of ups and downs.\u201dabatheja@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

In advance of the tournament, few Brazilians see hosting the event as advantageous for their country, a new survey shows.Inflation and joblessness are considered very big problems in the country, and two-thirds describe the economic situation as bad.While 51 percent of those polled said they had an overall favorable opinion of President Dilma Rousseff, Brazilians\u2019 assessment of her handling of specific concerns was far more negative. There is widespread disapproval of how Ms. Rousseff has been dealing with many of Brazilians\u2019 top concerns, including corruption, crime, health care and education. Two-thirds said they disapproved of how she had been preparing for the World Cup, and nearly as many were unhappy with her stewardship of the economy.Brazilians are also split over how the World Cup will affect the country\u2019s image around the world: 35 percent said it would enhance Brazil\u2019s position, 39 percent said it would hurt Brazil, and 23 percent said it would have no effect. Three-quarters of Brazilians think the country deserves more respect internationally than it currently receives.At the same time, Brazilians are feeling less confident about their country\u2019s place in the world. Four years ago, during a previous national Pew survey of Brazil, 24 percent of respondents said it was already one of the most powerful nations, and 53 percent said it would eventually be.

{"Headline": "Women on the Board: Quotas Have Limited Success", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMandating EqualityAn increasingly popular idea in Europe is affirmative action for executives \u2014 requiring companies to include a certain percentage of women in management, particularly on their boards. Improvement at the top, the thinking goes, is likely to filter down at companies, improving the pay and representation of women at lower levels.Still, their study rebutted one of the biggest criticisms of affirmative action for executives \u2014 that the women who serve would be unqualified or viewed as token appointees.Norwegian companies so resisted the idea of appointing women to their boards that 384 of the 563 publicly traded companies subject to the quota became private to avoid complying. Yet as women\u2019s representation on Norwegian boards increased from 5 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2007, the quality of the women on boards also increased, the study said.\u201cPreviously untapped networks of top business women were activated by the policy,\u201d the authors wrote, including through a database the government started of qualified women. They were also paid more equitably, and the number of women among the very top executives at companies increased.The authors expected to find that these women, in turn, would mine their networks to appoint lower-level women executives, add workplace policies like child care or inspire younger women to delay having children to stay on the business fast track. But in the decade since Norway passed the law, none of these things occurred.\u201cThere\u2019s still a mentality at a lot of companies that, \u2018We\u2019ve got a woman, that\u2019s fine,\u2019 but there isn\u2019t this march to get to a third or half women,\u201d said Ilene H.

{"Headline": "Europe Gets Negative Interest Rates. What Does That Even Mean?", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyFirst there was ZIRP. Now get ready for NIRP.That makes this a good moment for the curious mental exercise of pondering what a negative interest rate even means, and why it\u2019s something that monetary policy mavens have been talking about more than they would like over the last half-decade.What is a negative interest rate? When a bank pays a 1 percent interest rate, it\u2019s clear what happens: If you deposit your money at the bank, it will pay you a penny each year for every dollar you deposited. When the interest rate is negative, the money goes the other direction.We\u2019re talking about central banks here, but the same notion applies. Commercial banks maintain their reserves electronically at a central bank, like the Federal Reserve in the United States or an arm of the European Central Bank in Europe. In normal times, they are paid an interest rate set by the central bank for reserves they keep on deposit beyond what is needed to meet regulatory requirements. If the E.C.B. moves to a negative interest rate, they will instead have to pay the central bank to park money there.Put bluntly: Normally the banks pay you to keep your money there. Under negative rates, you pay them for the privilege.Why would the E.C.B. do that?Inflation in Europe has fallen far below the 2 percent or so that the central bank aims for, unemployment remains high in much of the continent, and growth sluggish. The central banker\u2019s usual answer to that set of problems is simple: Cut interest rates. But with the E.C.B. already paying zero percent on deposits that banks park with it, the only way to cut rates further is to go into negative territory.The theory is that when it becomes more costly for European banks to keep money in the E.C.B., they will have incentive to do something else with it: Lend it out to consumers or businesses, for example. Or if negative rates make it less attractive for global investors to park money in Europe, it could cause the euro to fall on currency markets, helping reverse a rise in its value that has made European exporters less competitive.How will banks react to negative rates?Banks will most likely pass these negative interest rates on to consumers, or at least try to. They may try to do so not by explicitly charging a negative interest rate, but by paying no interest and charging a fee for account maintenance.(For example, if you have 10,000 euros in an account and the bank starts levying a 25-euro maintenance fee, you\u2019ve just effectively received an -0.25 percent interest rate.)On the other hand, if the interest rate is only slightly negative, banks may just eat the loss in order to avoid alienating customers. If they do that, however, it will cut into bank profitability.But, if you make interest rates negative, won\u2019t people just withdraw their money? Maybe! This is one of the big reasons that the E.C.B. has moved so reluctantly toward a negative interest rate and the Fed, Bank of Japan and Bank of England haven\u2019t gone that direction.It is possible that, assuming banks pass along the negative rates through either fees or explicitly charging negative interest, people will withdraw their money as cash rather than keeping it on deposit at banks. As the Harvard economist N. Greg Mankiw put it wryly at a 2010 Boston Fed conference: \u201cWhat a depositor is going to do is say, \u2018Well, if they\u2019re going to charge me money to keep my money at the bank, I\u2019m just going to keep my money at home,\u2019 and the only thing you\u2019ll generate is a demand for safe assets \u2014 and by that I mean . . . they\u2019re going to be buying a bunch of safes so people can put their money in their safes rather than in the bank.\u201dThat is one big reason that the E.C.B. and other central banks are going to be reluctant to make rates highly negative; it could result in people pulling cash out of the banking system.Has anybody done this before? What happened? Aren\u2019t there other ways the E.C.B. could try to get Europe out of its low-inflation trap? There are, but Mario Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, has resisted the preferred tool of the American, British, and Japanese central banks, which is \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d or buying longer-term securities to pump money into the financial system.It would be politically risky for the E.C.B. to buy bonds issued by European governments, a no-no in the founding mission of the common central bank. And private European debt markets are not as developed in the United States, so it would be hard for the E.C.B. to emulate, for example, the Fed\u2019s strategy of buying mortgage-backed securities that fund home loans in the United States.That brings us back to NIRP. Now central bank watchers will get to watch yet another monetary policy experiment in an era that has been filled with them.The Upshot: The Upshot provides news, analysis\nand graphics about politics,\npolicy and everyday life.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Game of Groans", "Date": "2014-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday let\u2019s find fun ways to talk about the Highway Trust Fund.I\u2019m thinking about a game, where players move tiny cars around the board, trying to make money for road and bridge repair. If nobody wins, construction workers will be laid off, the economy will tank and every player has to spend the winter sitting in a 7-foot-wide pothole.This could happen! O.K., not necessarily the pothole part. But the Trust Fund is about to run out of money. It\u2019s a fiscal cliff for the nation\u2019s road crews.Totally important subject. Plus, you know, we\u2019ve got a game.Gather around the board. Players have to pick a route toward raising at least $15 billion before Congress bolts for summer vacation. Every approach has its own dangers.Plus, there are penalty cards. For instance, if somebody draws \u201cWait for comprehensive tax reform!\u201d the entire game will come to a halt while all the most thoughtful players go into another room and put their heads down for two hours. Everybody else will be allowed to hang around the bar and drink merlot.Ready to go? Pick your own route to the finish line:1) Gas Tax TurnpikeThe Trust Fund gets its money from a federal gas tax, which is currently 18.4 cents a gallon. I say currently as in \u201cever since 1993.\u201d That was part of the dreadful Clinton tax increases that led to a long, dark winter of balanced budgets and 4 percent unemployment rates.The player hops over to a picture of Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who recently introduced a bill that would raise the gas tax 6 cents a year for the next two years. On the day before his press conference, a 118-year-old swing bridge in Murphy\u2019s home state got stuck in the open position, blocking trains carrying thousands of commuters.\u201cSomebody in the Senate needs to break the ice,\u201d he said.Once a player hits Murphy\u2019s picture, she has to sit there until the senator gets some co-sponsors. He\u2019s working on it.2) Loophole Lane\u201cEverybody\u2019s looking for an answer, and it\u2019s staring us in the face,\u201d says Senator Patty Murray of Washington, where a bridge north of Seattle collapsed last year.Murray points out that Representative Dave Camp, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has already come up with a long list of tax loopholes he\u2019d like to close. The Senate Democrats should just volunteer to take a couple, she says. The only problem with this plan is that the Republicans in the House who are not Dave Camp have greeted his ideas as if they were a pack of rabid muskrats.This route involves crossing the treacherous John Boehner Gulch.3) Surprise StreetIn order to avoid the Gulch, a player may decide to take a spending-cut route. She then draws from a deck. If the card reads \u201cRepeal Obamacare,\u201d the other players have the right to grab the board and thwack her over the head.Other cards read: \u201cStop Saturday mail delivery.\u201d Weren\u2019t expecting that one, right? But, yes, some House Republicans have been looking at getting the money from the Postal Service, which could save about $20 billion over 10 years by ending weekend mail.On this route, players skip two turns out of every seven.4) Holiday HighwaySenate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky are proposing a tax holiday for multinational corporations.Multinationals like to sit offshore on top of piles of cash that they plan to bring back to the United States the very moment we declare that they will only have to pay a teeny portion of the taxes that they rightfully owe. Then there\u2019s a holiday \u2014 whoopee! \u2014 and a one-time flood of money. The problem is that it encourages these guys to park their profits abroad waiting for Congress to cave in once again.Players who pick this route get to wear special party hats. The downside is that Senator Elizabeth Warren will come into the room and bop them with a kazoo.5) Prestidigitation ParkwayThe last time we had this Highway Trust Fund problem, Congress just shifted cash from its general fund. The deficit actually did not get bigger. This worked because Congress is a magic place, and accounting is a mystical occupation.Many Republicans oppose this idea on principle. These are different principles from the ones that caused them to approve $75 billion worth of permanent tax breaks this week in the House without paying for them in any way whatsoever.On this route, a player simply grabs a bunch of money from the middle of the board and smirks.\u2022So, which way do you want to go, people? The gas tax certainly makes the most sense. Closing loopholes is always good. But if we\u2019re predicting the future, I\u2019d put my little car on the parkway where nobody actually has to do anything, all decisions get put off and everybody announces that the problem will be resolved just as soon as we get comprehensive tax reform.In the meantime, break out the merlot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Campaign Can\u2019t Be Deaf to Economic Worries, Obama Warns", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama acknowledged Wednesday that his efforts to combat climate change \u2014 in particular, Environmental Protection Agency regulations to slash carbon pollution from cars and coal-fired power plants \u2014 could raise fuel and electricity prices. And he told environmental advocates that in order to make a credible case for such climate policies, officials would need to acknowledge Americans\u2019 worries about the economic effects.\u201cPeople don\u2019t like gas prices going up; they are concerned about electricity prices going up,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a speech at an annual dinner for the League of Conservation Voters. \u201cIf we\u2019re blithe about saying, \u2018This is the crisis of our time,\u2019 but we don\u2019t acknowledge these legitimate concerns \u2014 we\u2019ve got to shape our strategies to address the very real and legitimate concerns of working families.\u201dClimate change remains among the few policy items he can push through without action from Congress, and the issue is likely to define the remainder of his time in office.Mr. Obama also said Wednesday that he recognized that even as he pushed the United States to cut its carbon pollution, emissions were soaring in developing economies, particularly in India and China, as those nations seek to lift millions of people out of poverty.\u201cThe trade-offs for them are tougher than for us unless we describe how development should leapfrog the old sources of energy,\u201d the president said. He emphasized that the United States should take the lead in developing low-carbon sources of energy that would give poorer economies better access to electricity without increasing their carbon pollution.At the State Department, diplomats are working toward a global carbon-cutting deal to be signed in 2015, and Mr. Obama said nations would be lured to the negotiating table if the United States managed to cut carbon pollution without hurting the domestic economy.\u201cWhen America proves what\u2019s possible, other countries are going to come along,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama again mocked officials who question or deny the established science that human activity, particularly the burning of coal and oil, cause climate change.\u201cIn communities, they may not know how big a problem climate change is, but they generally don\u2019t say, \u2018I don\u2019t believe anything scientists say\u2019 \u2014 except in Congress,\u201d he said.Democrats have increased attacks on Republicans who deny human involvement in climate change, seeing it as a winning political strategy. Polls by the League of Conservation Voters and other groups show that younger voters in particular associate candidates who deny climate science with being out of touch.Just three weeks ago, Mr. Obama announced a landmark Environmental Protection Agency regulation aimed at slashing planet-warming carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, the nation\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. But the rule faces substantial legal, political and legislative attacks, and Republicans have criticized it as a \u201cwar on coal\u201d that will drive up energy prices and eliminate jobs in the coal industry.The administration has begun an aggressive public relations effort to help sell the new proposal to the public, and environmental groups are gearing up to back politicians who embrace the rule. A major part of that campaign will be to convince Americans that climate change poses as much of a threat to the nation\u2019s economy as it does to the environment.That effort was aided this week by the release of a report laying out the economic threats posed by human-caused climate change. The report, written by a team of economists and analysts, was financed by a bipartisan team of financiers \u2014 the billionaire Tom Steyer, who is campaigning to elect politicians who push climate policy; former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., who served as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush.In particular, the report highlighted soaring costs for the insurance industry and taxpayers as more extreme storms batter the coasts, and the expenses that farmers and consumers will face as increased drought devastates farmland and reduces crop yields.On Tuesday, Mr. Obama\u2019s top advisers and cabinet members, including his counselor, John Podesta; Treasury Secretary Jack Lew; Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and the senior adviser Valerie Jarrett met with the backers and authors of the report and with top officials from the insurance industry to discuss the economic consequences of increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Official: The Boomerang Kids Won\u2019t Leave", "Date": "2014-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u00a0\u201cTwo years ago, I was dating this guy long distance from Wisconsin, and he told me that he would never marry me because of my debt. I just was dumbfounded and taken aback and didn\u2019t say anything and let it really sink in. I really shot myself down about it for about a year and just beat myself up and was doing all the stuff I could do to make money. And finally I was like, My loans don\u2019t define me. Yeah, they suck, but you know. It still kind of breaks my heart when I think about that someone would say that.\u201dPhotographs by Damon Casarez\ufeffInterviews by Taffy Brodesser-AknerAnnie Kasinecz has two different ways of explaining why, at age 27, she still lives with her mom. In the first version \u2014 the optimistic one \u2014 she says that she is doing the sensible thing by living rent-free as she plans her next career move. After graduating from Loyola University Chicago, Kasinecz struggled to support herself in the midst of the recession, working a series of unsatisfying jobs \u2014 selling ads at the soon-to-be bankrupt Sun-Times, bagging groceries at Whole Foods, bartending \u2014 in order to pay down her student loans. But she inevitably grew frustrated with each job and found herself stuck in one financial mess after another. Now that she\u2019s back in her high-school bedroom, perhaps she can finally focus on her long-term goals.But in the second version \u2014 the bleaker one \u2014 Kasinecz admits that she fears that her mom\u2019s house in Downers Grove, Ill., half an hour west of the city, has become a crutch. She has been living in that old bedroom for four years and is nowhere closer to figuring out what she\u2019s going to do with her career. \u201cEveryone tells me to just pick something,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know what to pick.\u201dOne in five people in their 20s and early 30s is currently living with his or her parents. And 60 percent of all young adults receive financial support from them. That\u2019s a significant increase from a generation ago, when only one in 10 young adults moved back home and few received financial support. The common explanation for the shift is that people born in the late 1980s and early 1990s came of age amid several unfortunate and overlapping economic trends. Those who graduated college as the housing market and financial system were imploding faced the highest debt burden of any graduating class in history. Nearly 45 percent of 25-year-olds, for instance, have outstanding loans, with an average debt above $20,000. (Kasinecz still has about $60,000 to go.) And more than half of recent college graduates are unemployed or underemployed, meaning they make substandard wages in jobs that don\u2019t require a college degree. According to Lisa B. Kahn, an economist at Yale University, the negative impact of graduating into a recession never fully disappears. Even 20 years later, the people who graduated into the recession of the early \u201980s were making substantially less money than people lucky enough to have graduated a few years afterward, when the economy was booming.Some may hope that the boomerang generation represents an unfortunate but temporary blip \u2014 that the class of 2015 will be able to land great jobs out of college, and that they\u2019ll reach financial independence soon after reaching the drinking age. But the latest recession was only part of the boomerang generation\u2019s problem. In reality, it simply amplified a trend that had been growing stealthily for more than 30 years. Since 1980, the U.S. economy has been destabilized by a series of systemic changes \u2014 the growth of foreign trade, rapid advances in technology, changes to the tax code, among others \u2014 that have affected all workers but particularly those just embarking on their careers. In 1968, for instance, a vast majority of 20-somethings were living independent lives; more than half were married. But over the past 30 years, the onset of sustainable economic independence has been steadily receding. By 2007, before the recession even began, fewer than one in four young adults were married, and 34 percent relied on their parents for rent.These boomerang kids are not a temporary phenomenon. They appear to be part of a new and permanent life stage. More than that, they represent a much larger anxiety-provoking but also potentially thrilling economic evolution that is affecting all of us. It\u2019s so new, in fact, that most boomerang kids and their parents are still struggling to make sense of it. Is living with your parents a sign, as it once was, of failure? Or is it a practical, long-term financial move? This was the question that the photographer Damon Casarez, who is 26, asked when he moved in with his parents after graduating from art school. So he started searching for other boomerang kids, using tools like Craigslist. The result is this photo essay. And the answer to whether boomeranging is a good or a bad thing depends, as Kasinecz noted, on how you look at it.Childhood is a fairly recent economic innovation. For most of recorded history, a vast majority of people began working by age 4, typically on a farm, and were full time by 10. According to James Marten, a historian at Marquette University and the editor of The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth, it wasn\u2019t until the 1830s, as the U.S. economy began to shift from subsistence agriculture to industry and markets, that life began to change slowly for little kids. Parents were getting richer, family sizes fell and, by the 1850s, school attendance started to become mandatory. By the end of the Civil War, much of American culture had accepted the notion that children under 13 should be protected from economic life, and child-labor laws started emerging around the turn of the century. As the country grew wealthier over the ensuing decades, childhood expanded along with it. Eventually, teenagers were no longer considered younger, less-competent adults but rather older children who should be nurtured and encouraged to explore.But we now know that, during the \u201970s, this system was becoming unhinged. Computer technology and global trade forced manual laborers to compete with machines at home and with low-wage workers in other countries. The changes first affected blue-collar workers, but many white-collar workers performing routine tasks, like office support or drafting or bookkeeping, were also seeing their job prospects truncated. At the same time, these developments were hugely beneficial to elite earners, who now had access to a larger, global market and productivity-enhancing technology. They were assisted by changes in government policy \u2014 taxes were cut, welfare programs were eliminated \u2014 that further rewarded the wealthy and removed support for the poor.Millennials\u2019 parents could be forgiven for underestimating the consequences of these trends. For most of American history, it was natural for each generation to become richer than the previous one. Now that\u2019s no longer true. These changes created a new, far less predictable dynamic \u2014 some people would do much better than their parents could have ever dreamed; others would fall permanently behind. Given the volatility of the changes, the idea of an \u201caverage\u201d worker was becoming obsolete. And while much of the discussion about economic inequality has centered on the top 1 percent, it\u2019s the gap between the top 20 percent and the rest that\u2019s more salient to young people. \u201cThat is a dividing point,\u201d says Mark Rank, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. People in the top 20 percent of income \u2014 roughly $100,000 in 2013 \u2014 have taken nearly all the economic gains of the past 40 years. (Of course, the top 1 percent and, even more so, the top 0.01 percent, has taken a far more disproportionate share).For all these grim forecasts, people now in their 20s are remarkably optimistic. Arnett, who recently conducted a nationwide poll of the group, discovered that 77 percent still believe they will be better off than their parents. A Pew survey found that only 9 percent of young adults believe they won\u2019t be able to afford the lives they want. This combination of confidence in the face of historic uncertainty might seem confusing, but Arnett argues that optimistic boomerang kids might not be as blithely na\u00efve as their parents imagine. Many are rejecting the Dilbertian goal of a steady, if unsatisfying, job for years of experimentation, even repeated failure, that eventually leads to a richly satisfying career. Sleeping in a twin bed under some old Avril Lavigne posters is not a sign of giving up; it\u2019s an economic plan. \u201cStop dumping on them because they need parental support,\u201d Arnett cautioned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re lazy. It\u2019s just harder to make your way now than it was in an older and simpler economy.\u201dAdrianne Smith, 28, graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2008 and went to work as a behavioral analyst treating children on the autism spectrum. She was quickly making more than $60,000 a year, but in order to earn that money, \u201cI had a huge caseload,\u201d she said, handling 25 clients while paying off more than $40,000 in student loans. She knew of therapists earning $100,000 annually, but they did so by handling 40 or more physically and emotionally demanding cases.So Smith came up with a more efficient idea. After doing some research on local clinics, she noticed that a rise in autism diagnoses mirrored the rising demand for clinic services. And with the convenience of modern technology, from smartphones to their attendant payment readers, she could build a clinic serving clients in their homes, one that could be leveraged into a larger regional network. With a bit of hustle, Smith thought, she could set herself up with a profitable business that would give her returns for the rest of her life. To afford the start-up costs, she moved back in with her parents, turned her sister\u2019s old room into an office where she could work and store toys for her clients, and used what would have been rent money to develop a website and hire a few part-time therapists to make house calls. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have opened a clinic without my parents\u2019 support,\u201d she said. Now when Smith meets peers who deride her for living at home, she replies that it\u2019s really just a business incubator.I wasn\u2019t surprised that Arnett was impressed by Smith\u2019s plan. But I didn\u2019t expect him to praise Kasinecz too. At 27, she had a lot of debt, no career in mind and a series of unsatisfying jobs. I worried that her prospects were dimming, that crossing that 20 percent threshold would seem harder and harder with each passing year. She seemed worried, too. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of in this limbo phase where we\u2019re expected to be these great professionals who come out of college with bomb-ass jobs,\u201d she said of her generation. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re like, Wait. I\u2019ve got 80 grand in debt. How am I supposed to do that?\u201dArnett told me, however, that I wasn\u2019t seeing her hidden strengths. In fact, he would be far more worried if she had done what the previous generations did \u2014 stayed in whatever job she took after graduating, no matter how little she liked it \u2014 or if she were similarly underemployed but expressed no urgency about finding a better job. Kasinecz, he said, was still searching for the right fit and refusing to settle for anything less. Somewhat counterintuitively, Arnett said, it\u2019s the people most actively involved in this struggle, the ones who at times seem totally lost, who are likely to find their way. Kasinecz seemed to know this, too. And in that sense, she was emblematic of a generation in which there are no more average workers and even less certainty. Kasinecz may well find a job she likes and, eventually, the right career \u2014 even if she terrifies her mother, herself and a few hand-wringing economists in the process.A picture caption on June 22 with an article about young adults who live with their parents described incorrectly the firm for which Alexandria Romo works.

{"Headline": "Noncompete Clauses Increasingly Pop Up in Array of Jobs", "Date": "2014-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 Colette Buser couldn\u2019t understand why a summer camp withdrew its offer for her to work there this year.After all, the 19-year-old college student had worked as a counselor the three previous summers at a nearby Linx-branded camp in Wellesley, Mass. But the company balked at hiring her because it feared that Linx would sue to enforce a noncompete clause tucked into Ms. Buser\u2019s 2013 summer employment contract. Her father, Cimarron Buser, testified before Massachusetts state lawmakers last month that his daughter had no idea that she had agreed to such restrictions, which in this case forbade her for one year from working at a competing camp within 10 miles of any of Linx\u2019s more than 30 locations in Wellesley and neighboring Natick. \u201cThis was the type of example you could hardly believe,\u201d Mr. Buser (pronounced BOO-ser) said in an interview.Noncompete clauses are now appearing in far-ranging fields beyond the worlds of technology, sales and corporations with tightly held secrets, where the curbs have traditionally been used. From event planners to chefs to investment fund managers to yoga instructors, employees are increasingly required to sign agreements that prohibit them from working for a company\u2019s rivals.There are plenty of other examples of these restrictions popping up in new job categories: One Massachusetts man whose job largely involved spraying pesticides on lawns had to sign a two-year noncompete agreement. A textbook editor was required to sign a six-month pact.A Boston University graduate was asked to sign a one-year noncompete pledge for an entry-level social media job at a marketing firm, while a college junior who took a summer internship at an electronics firm agreed to a yearlong ban.\u201cThere has been a definite, significant rise in the use of noncompetes, and not only for high tech, not only for high-skilled knowledge positions,\u201d said Orly Lobel, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, who wrote a recent book on noncompetes. \u201cTalent Wants to be Free.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve become pervasive and standard in many service industries,\u201d Ms. Lobel added.Because of workers\u2019 complaints and concerns that noncompete clauses may be holding back the Massachusetts economy, Gov. Deval Patrick has proposed legislation that would ban noncompetes in all but a few circumstances, and a committee in the Massachusetts House has passed a bill incorporating the governor\u2019s proposals. To help assure that workers don\u2019t walk off with trade secrets, the proposed legislation would adopt tough new rules in that area. Supporters of the pending legislation argue that the proliferation of noncompetes is a major reason Silicon Valley has left Route 128 and the Massachusetts high-tech industry in the dust. California bars noncompete clauses except in very limited circumstances.\u201cNoncompetes are a dampener on innovation and economic development,\u201d said Paul Maeder, co-founder and general partner of Highland Capital Partners, a venture capital firm with offices in both Boston and Silicon Valley. \u201cThey result in a lot of stillbirths of entrepreneurship \u2014 someone who wants to start a company, but can\u2019t because of a noncompete.\u201dBackers of noncompetes counter that they help spur the state\u2019s economy and competitiveness by encouraging companies to invest heavily in their workers. Noncompetes are also needed, supporters say, to prevent workers from walking off with valuable code, customer lists, trade secrets or expensive training.Joe Kahn, Linx\u2019s owner and founder, defended the noncompete that his company uses. \u201cOur intellectual property is the training and fostering of our counselors, which makes for our unique environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much like a tech firm with designers who developed chips: You don\u2019t want those people walking out the door. It\u2019s the same for us.\u201d He called the restriction \u2014 no competing camps within 10 miles \u2014 very reasonable. \u201cThe ban to noncompetes is legislation in search of an issue,\u201d said Christopher P. Geehern, an executive vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a trade group leading the fight to defeat the proposed restrictions. \u201cThey\u2019re used in almost every sector of the economy to the seemingly mutual satisfaction of employers and individuals.\u201dThe legislative fight here pits two powerful groups against each other: venture capitalists opposing noncompetes and many manufacturers and tech companies eager to preserve them.John Hazen, chief executive at Hazen Paper, said his 230-employee company in Holyoke, Mass., spends heavily to train workers on sophisticated machinery and elaborate papermaking processes.\u201cNoncompetes reduce the potential for poaching,\u201d said Mr. Hazen, whose company makes scratch lottery tickets and special packaging. \u201cWe consider them an important way to protect our business. As an entrepreneur who invests a lot of money in equipment, in intellectual property and in people, I\u2019m worried about losing these people we\u2019ve invested in.\u201dThe United States has a patchwork of rules on noncompetes. Only California and North Dakota ban them, while states like Texas and Florida place few limits on them. When these cases wind up in court, judges often cut back the time restraints if they\u2019re viewed as unreasonable, such as lasting five years or longer.\u201cIn most states there has to be a legitimate business interest, and it has to be narrowly tailored and reasonable in scope and duration,\u201d said Samuel Estreicher, a professor at New York University School of Law.Daniel McKinnon, who had been a hairstylist in Norwell, Mass., lost a court battle with his former employer who claimed that Mr. McKinnon had violated the terms of his agreement when he went to work at a nearby salon. Mr. McKinnon said that he did not think the original restriction \u2014 to wait at least 12 months before working at any salon in nearby towns \u2014 still applied because he had been fired after years of friction with the manager there. Shortly after being fired, he went to work at a nearby salon. But a judge issued an injunction ordering him to stop working at his new employer.\u201cIt was pretty lousy that you would take away someone\u2019s livelihood like that,\u201d said Mr. McKinnon, who for the following year lived off jobless benefits of $300 a week. \u201cI almost lost my truck. I almost lost my apartment. Almost everything came sweeping out from under me.\u201dHe resisted the idea of traveling miles from his apartment to a new salon, saying that would have meant an unpleasant and costly commute.\u201cThe salon where I worked was doing just fine \u2014 I don\u2019t see why they needed to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cI basically had to give up a year of working.\u201dWendi S. Lazar, an employment lawyer in Manhattan, said she saw an increase in litigation to enforce noncompetes. \u201cCompanies are spending money, hiring lawyers, to go after people \u2014 just to put the fear of death in them.\u201dState Representative Lori Ehrlich, one of the main sponsors of the Massachusetts legislation to bar noncompetes and vice chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Labor and Workforce Development, said that many people had complained to her about the restrictions being set for employees.\u201cIt\u2019s hurting growth in the economy by decreasing worker mobility and squelching start-ups,\u201d Ms. Ehrlich, a Democrat, said. \u201cThey\u2019re hurting families by making it so people are unable to work for an extended period of time. This has increasingly become exploitative to workers.\u201d Matthew Marx, a professor of entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, said a recent study he did found that half of the nation\u2019s engineers had signed noncompetes, with a third lasting more than a year, and some more than two years.\u201cWhere noncompetes are not enforced, there\u2019s a more open labor market \u2014 companies compete for talent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to have a saying at the Silicon Valley start-up where I worked, \u2018You never stop hiring someone.\u2019 They can go where they want. People are free to leave and start companies if they\u2019re not happy.\u201dProfessor Marx said California\u2019s ban on noncompetes was a major reason Silicon Valley was thriving. If a few employees there have an innovative idea and their bosses don\u2019t want to pursue it, they can leave to found a start-up. But in Massachusetts, if employees with noncompetes bring that innovative idea to their boss and it is rejected, they are stuck \u2014 or they would have to leave the company and wait a year before they could pursue their new idea. (Or they could move to California, where the courts would not enforce the Massachusetts agreement.)Mr. Geehern of Associated Industries of Massachusetts denied that the California economy, with a 7.8 percent jobless rate, was doing better than the Massachusetts economy, with a 6 percent rate.\u201cIf noncompetes are so onerous and burdensome, why aren\u2019t we seeing a significant migration of talent away from the companies that use noncompetes toward the companies that don\u2019t use them?\u201d he said. \u201cThe companies that use noncompetes still attract plenty of the best and brightest.\u201dMichael Rodrigues, a Democratic state senator from Fall River, Mass., said the government should not be interfering in contractual matters like noncompetes. \u201cIt should be up to the individual employer and the individual potential employee among themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re both adults.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lack of Major Wars May Be Hurting Economic Growth", "Date": "2014-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Pitfalls of PeaceThe continuing slowness of economic growth in high-income economies has prompted soul-searching among economists. They have looked to weak demand, rising inequality, Chinese competition, over-regulation, inadequate infrastructure and an exhaustion of new technological ideas as possible culprits.An additional explanation of slow growth is now receiving attention, however. It is the persistence and expectation of peace.The world just hasn\u2019t had that much warfare lately, at least not by historical standards. Some of the recent headlines about Iraq or South Sudan make our world sound like a very bloody place, but today\u2019s casualties pale in light of the tens of millions of people killed in the two world wars in the first half of the 20th century. Even the Vietnam War had many more deaths than any recent war involving an affluent country.Counterintuitive though it may sound, the greater peacefulness of the world may make the attainment of higher rates of economic growth less urgent and thus less likely. This view does not claim that fighting wars improves economies, as of course the actual conflict brings death and destruction. The claim is also distinct from the Keynesian argument that preparing for war lifts government spending and puts people to work. Rather, the very possibility of war focuses the attention of governments on getting some basic decisions right \u2014 whether investing in science or simply liberalizing the economy. Such focus ends up improving a nation\u2019s longer-run prospects.It may seem repugnant to find a positive side to war in this regard, but a look at American history suggests we cannot dismiss the idea so easily. Fundamental innovations such as nuclear power, the computer and the modern aircraft were all pushed along by an American government eager to defeat the Axis powers or, later, to win the Cold War. The Internet was initially designed to help this country withstand a nuclear exchange, and Silicon Valley had its origins with military contracting, not today\u2019s entrepreneurial social media start-ups. The Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred American interest in science and technology, to the benefit of later economic growth.Today the major slow-growing Western European nations have very little fear of being taken over militarily, and thus their politicians don\u2019t face extreme penalties for continuing stagnation. Instead, losing office often means a boost in income from speaking or consulting fees or a comfortable retirement in a pleasant vacation spot. Japan, by comparison, is faced with territorial and geopolitical pressures from China, and in response it is attempting a national revitalization through the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.But here is the catch: Whatever the economic benefits of potential conflict might have been, the calculus is different today. Technologies have become much more destructive, and so a large-scale war would be a bigger disaster than before. That makes many wars less likely, which is a good thing, but it also makes economic stagnation easier to countenance.There is a more optimistic read to all this than may first appear. Arguably the contemporary world is trading some growth in material living standards for peace \u2014 a relative paucity of war deaths and injuries, even with a kind of associated laziness.We can prefer higher rates of economic growth and progress, even while recognizing that recent G.D.P. figures do not adequately measure all of the gains we have been enjoying. In addition to more peace, we also have a cleaner environment (along most but not all dimensions), more leisure time and a higher degree of social tolerance for minorities and formerly persecuted groups. Our more peaceful and \u2014 yes \u2014 more slacker-oriented world is in fact better than our economic measures acknowledge.Living in a largely peaceful world with 2 percent G.D.P. growth has some big advantages that you don\u2019t get with 4 percent growth and many more war deaths. Economic stasis may not feel very impressive, but it\u2019s something our ancestors never quite managed to pull off. The real questions are whether we can do any better, and whether the recent prevalence of peace is a mere temporary bubble just waiting to be burst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Officials Urge France and Italy to Accelerate Economic Reforms", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Top European Union officials on Monday warned France and Italy to do more to reform their economies to prevent a rerun of problems that fueled the region\u2019s debt crisis and nearly destroyed the euro currency union.The major concern is that some large countries in the euro area are not moving fast enough to overhaul their economies, reduce debt and prune budget deficits. Officials in Brussels had already granted France extra time to meet the targets that all member countries have agreed to.As part of a closely watched annual review of targets and goals laid down by the authorities in Brussels, Olli Rehn, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for economic affairs, reserved his toughest warnings for France and Italy, which are the second- and third-largest countries in the euro bloc after Germany.\u201cIn France the deterioration of the trade balance and competitiveness over the whole of the last decade calls for sustained political action,\u201d Mr. Rehn said at a news conference. The government in Paris, he said, needs to \u201cgo into greater detail about the measures which it intends to take to achieve\u201d its previously agreed goal of reducing its deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2015.Turning to Italy, Mr. Rehn warned that the government in Rome could still face the wrath of bond markets if it failed to lower its towering national debt.\u201cMarket confidence has been restored and Italian bond yields are currently at a record low,\u201d Mr. Rehn said. \u201cBut betting on continued benign financial market conditions may be risky. Market sentiment can change quite swiftly as we know and debt levels can often be the factor to spark such a change.\u201dThe report released on Monday covered 26 of the 28 member states of the European Union, excluding Cyprus and Greece, which continue to receive rescue payments and are already under special, closer scrutiny.It is a delicate moment for the leadership in Brussels. Officials are under pressure to reduce their intervention in member states\u2019 national affairs, given the big gains that various anti-European Union parties made in May\u2019s elections to the European Parliament in a number countries \u2014 and in France in particular.Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the union, sought to buck up governments that have been weakened by insurgent parties, saying at a news conference on Monday that the \u201cfundamental challenge for the E.U. now is political\u201d to \u201ckeep up support for reform as the pressure of the crisis recedes\u201d even in the face of blistering opposition.Politicians, he said, must \u201cshow leadership and summon the political will to see reform through, even if it is unpopular.\u201dBut for the French members of the Socialist bloc at the European Parliament, Mr. Barroso\u2019s approach was a sign Brussels was more out of touch than ever.\u201cFollowing the European elections, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso sought to smooth over\u201d the way the bloc\u2019s authorities are perceived, the lawmakers said in a statement. \u201cBut, down deep, nothing has changed,\u201d it continued, and \u201causterity and neo-liberalism remain the ideological pillars of an exhausted European Commission.\u201dThe wave that swept populist and protest parties into the European Parliament was partly in response to deeply unpopular debt-slashing policies pushed by Mr. Barroso\u2019s commission. Those policies have been aimed at saving the bloc\u2019s flagship economic project, the euro currency union, while minimizing the burden paid by big member states like Germany.The authorities in Brussels have already begun easing the toughest austerity requirements that have caused so much hardship in countries like Greece, Portugal and Ireland. In the past year, Brussels has instead emphasized the need for governments to make their economies more competitive through structural overhauls in areas like employment policy.Much of the attention on Monday was expected to have been on France, which has been slow to revamp an economy plagued by weak growth and high unemployment. Even before Monday\u2019s review, the commission had warned Paris that France did not seem likely to meet its deficit deadline.A crucial factor in France is whether the inroads made by the far-right National Front during the May elections will make it harder for the Socialist government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to carry out plans that include both pro-business tax cuts and a reduction in state spending.Last year Mr. Hollande warned the European Commission against trying to dictate pension reforms. But Paris\u2019s reaction Monday was comparatively subdued. In a statement, the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, rather than address the commission\u2019s warning, asserted that the government had taken an \u201cambitious\u201d approach.Italy was also in focus on Monday following a strong showing in the European parliamentary elections by the Democratic Party led by Matteo Renzi. Despite his resounding victory, Mr. Renzi still faces the task of devising a strategy to prune the country\u2019s large debt \u2014 which Morgan Stanley said could rise to 134 percent of G.D.P. this year \u2014 while maintaining his popularity.A danger for Italy is that weak growth, feeble competitiveness and worrisomely low inflation mean that its primary budget surplus \u201cisn\u2019t yet sufficient to stabilize government debt,\u201d according to a report by Daniele Antonucci, a senior European economist for Morgan Stanley.On Monday, Mr. Rehn said that some finance targets for Italy would be loosened only if the economy performed worse than expected.\u201cShould the expected recovery in Italy fail to materialize and the country fall back into recession\u201d then \u201cthe rules would allow for an automatic reconsideration of the required adjustment path,\u201d said Mr. Rehn, referring to the possibility that the country\u2019s structural deficit goals could be eased under those circumstances.But \u201cpostponing the achievement of the medium-term budgetary objective does not put Italy in a good position vis-\u00e0-vis the rules that it has subscribed to and indeed inscribed in its own constitution,\u201d Mr. Rehn said.Pier Carlo Padoan, the Italian minister for the economy and finance, acknowledged on Twitter that Italy \u201cmust accelerate reforms and privatizations\u201d to reduce its debt \u201cin a sustainable manner.\u201dElisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Matter With Eastern Kentucky?", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyThere are many tough places in this country: the ghost cities of Detroit, Camden and Gary, the sunbaked misery of inland California and the isolated reservations where Native American communities were left to struggle. But in its persistent poverty, Eastern Kentucky \u2014 land of storybook hills and drawls \u00ad \u2014 just might be the hardest place to live in the United States. Statistically speaking.Clay County, in dead last, might as well be in a different country. The median household income there is barely above the poverty line, at $22,296, and is just over half the nationwide median. Only 7.4 percent of the population has a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. The unemployment rate is 12.7 percent. The disability rate is nearly as high, at 11.7 percent. (Nationwide, that figure is 1.3 percent.) Life expectancy is six years shorter than average. Perhaps related, nearly half of Clay County is obese.It\u2019s coal country, but perhaps in name only. In the first quarter of this year, just 54 people were employed in coal mining in Clay County, a precipitous drop from its coal-production peak in 1980. That year, about 2.5 million tons of coal were taken out of the ground in Clay; this year, the county has produced a fraction of that \u2014 just over 38,000 tons. Former mines have been reclaimed, and that land has been repurposed in scattershot ways: a golf course, shopping centers, a medium-security federal prison. But nothing has truly come to replace the industry on which Clay County once depended.The public debate about the haves and the have-nots tends to focus on the 1 percent, especially on the astonishing, breakaway wealth in cities like New York, San Francisco and Washington and the great disparities contained therein. But what has happened in the smudge of the country between New Orleans and Pittsburgh \u2014 the Deep South and Appalachia \u2014 is in many ways as remarkable as what has happened in affluent cities. In some places, decades of growth have failed to raise incomes, and of late, poverty has become more concentrated not in urban areas but in rural ones.Despite this, rural poverty is largely shunted aside in the conversation about inequality, much in the way rural areas have been left behind by broader shifts in the economy. The sheer intractability of rural poverty raises uncomfortable questions about how to fix it, or to what extent it is even fixable.The desperation in coal country is hard to square with the beauty of the place \u2014 the densely flocked hills peppered with tiny towns. It\u2019s magical. But it is also poor, even if economic growth and the federal safety-net programs have drastically improved what that poverty looks like.Fifty years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared his \u201cwar on poverty\u201d from a doorstep in the tiny Kentucky town of Inez, and since then, Washington has directed trillions of dollars to such communities in the form of cash assistance, food stamps, Medicaid and tax incentives for development. (In some places, these transfer payments make up half of all income.) Still, after adjusting for inflation, median income was higher in Clay County in 1979 than it is now, even though the American economy has more than doubled in size.There have been periodic attempts to flood persistently poor counties with federal dollars in an effort to jolt them into higher growth rates. The Obama administration this year named southeastern Kentucky a \u201cpromise zone,\u201d putting it at the top of the list for federal grants. It\u2019s an old idea: Draw in businesses, create jobs, help finance infrastructure, turn the cycle virtuous.On the opposite end of the ideological spectrum, Kentucky\u2019s libertarian senator, Rand Paul, has proposed a more supply-side-oriented strategy: Let certain counties eliminate capital-gains taxes and institute a special federal income tax of 5 percent in those areas. \u201cI\u2019m just letting you keep more of your own money,\u201d Paul said to a small crowd in a college auditorium in eastern Kentucky last winter. \u201cThe difference between this and a government grant is I don\u2019t choose who gets it.\u201d On either side of the aisle, the underlying assumption is the same: Places like Clay County just need a kick-start. But what if that isn\u2019t true?In many cases, a primary problem in poor rural areas is the very fact that they\u2019re rural \u2014 remote, miles from major highways and plagued by substandard infrastructure. Think about the advantages of urban areas, described by thinkers going back to Jane Jacobs and beyond. Density means more workers to choose from, more potential customers, more spillover knowledge from nearby companies. As such, cities punch above their weight, economically speaking. The 10 largest metro regions produced more than a third of the country\u2019s entire economic output as of 2012.The converse is true for rural areas. Take eastern Kentucky, grappling with the decline of coal \u2014 and perhaps looking at an even bleaker future for the industry, given recent carbon-reduction efforts by the E.P.A. Those rolling hills might be picturesque. But those country roads make it hard to ship goods in and out, in turn making it more expensive to build a warehouse or a factory.\u201cOne of the challenges that faces eastern Kentucky is the remoteness of the area,\u201d said James P. Ziliak, the director of the Center for Poverty Research at the University of Kentucky. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get to a lot of places. The communities are small, and they\u2019re spread apart, so you lose that synergy that you want to spark development a lot of times.\u201d Even with additional government subsidies, would businesses really want to move there? \u201cIt\u2019s this chicken-and-egg problem,\u201d Ziliak said. \u201cMy view is that firms will never locate into a community with an unskilled labor force, unless the only labor they need is unskilled. And there has been a historic lack of investment in human capital in these areas.\u201dThe queasy answer that economists come to is that it would be better to help the people than the place \u2014 in some cases, helping people leave the place. Generally, the wealthier and better educated the family, the more mobile they are. It takes resources to pack up all your things, sign a new lease, pay for gas or a flight and go. That might help explain why more Americans aren\u2019t flocking from places with high unemployment rates to places with low ones, even if those places are surprisingly close together. College graduates, for instance, are several times as responsive to differences in labor demand as those who completed only high school, according to a study in The Journal of Human Resources.But government policy based less on place and more on people might help ameliorate that trend. \u201cLet\u2019s say I was a hardworking person who lost my job in Harlan, Ky. \u2014 the ideal place, really, to go is Williston, N.D.,\u201d Senator Paul said. \u201cPeople need to be mobile to go there. Some government programs prevent mobility or discourage mobility.\u201d And none encourage it: There are scant federal resources to help the unemployed or the poor in rural areas move to a job or even just a better neighborhood. (Imagine Senator Mitch McConnell running for re-election on the campaign slogan: \u201cI\u2019ll get you out of this moribund area and up to the wilderness of North Dakota!\u201d)Of course, thousands of families in places like Kentucky, South Dakota and West Virginia manage to cobble together enough resources to make the move themselves; the share of Americans living in rural areas has slowly drifted down. In Clay County, the population has declined for the last decade. And the overall population in rural areas declined for the first time from 2010 to 2012, according to the Census Bureau.Jeff Whitehead runs the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program, which helps retrain laid-off coal miners and find them new jobs. \u201cThere\u2019s just very limited opportunity for the people who were working in the region,\u201d he said, adding that he helped 220 families move out of the area in recent years, despite many workers\u2019 understandable resistance. \u201cThat\u2019s a really hard pill to swallow. People are really connected to place here. For a lot of people, it\u2019s the last thing they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re holding off until they have no other choice.\u201dBut the number and proportion of people living in poverty in places like eastern Kentucky persists, despite all the trillions of dollars spent to improve the state of the poor in the United States and promote development. Ziliak thinks that efforts focused on human capital \u2014 meaning education initiatives, from prekindergarten all the way through college \u2014 might be the best use of any new money. But, of course, that also might mean more people moving away.Annie Lowrey was, until recently, an economics reporter for The Times. Alan Flippen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Issue of Pay for 2 Sets of Workers Tugs at Palestinian Pact", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRashad Samouni, 2, looked through a plastic sheet that acts as a window at his home in Gaza City. A rift over government pay has shaken the fragile pact between Hamas and the Palestine Liberation Organization.GAZA CITY \u2014 Abu Raid al-Samouni, 46, a driver and office cleaner in the Foreign Ministry headquarters here, leaves for work before his 14 children wake up each morning, to avoid their pleas for spare change to buy candy. Like the other 42,000 workers hired while the militant Islamic group Hamas ran the Gaza government over the past seven years, Mr. Samouni has received only part of his $350 monthly salary since October; in April and May, there was no paycheck at all.Mustafa, 34, a security officer who spoke on the condition that his last name not be used for fear of reprisals, spent a recent afternoon smoking a water pipe in a beachside cafe as his three children swam in the Mediterranean Sea. Like the other 70,000 people employed by the Palestinian Authority in Gaza before Hamas wrested control of it, the political split means that he has continued to collect his full salary \u2014 $520 a month \u2014 without ever actually going to work.Hamas leaders have said they have no information about the abduction but nonetheless praised it, and lashed out at President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority for condemning the captors and deploying his security forces to help Israel track them down.Yet underlying that fierce ideological battle is a more basic, bureaucratic one that also endangers the fragile agreement.The Palestinian prime minister insists that he does not have enough money to pay both sets of workers and, perhaps more important, cannot risk the wrath of other countries by even funneling donated funds to anyone affiliated with Hamas.Mustafa, who has used his spare time to earn $25 a day driving a taxi in recent years, said of Mr. Samouni and his colleagues, \u201cI feel sorry for them, but it\u2019s not my problem.\u201d\u201cI know these young employees have no fault, and it\u2019s hard to imagine how they will return to their kids without money or food in Ramadan,\u201d Mustafa said, referring to the Muslim holy month, which starts Saturday. \u201cBut it\u2019s the dirty politics.\u201dOn Thursday, some Hamas-appointed workers went on strike to protest the lack of pay, though the effects were minimal because security and health care services continued as usual.\u201cThis is an initial warning measure, and other escalatory measures will follow until we get all our rights from those who do not consider us in their calculations,\u201d said Mohammed Siam, a spokesman for the workers. \u201cWe want our rights as legitimate employees to be recognized.\u201dWith payday coming next week, many Palestinians fear a reprise of what happened earlier this month: Hamas officers, in order to block the former Palestinian Authority workers from withdrawing their salaries, shut down banks across Gaza for a week, further weakening the economy.Hamas, which won legislative elections in 2006, had essentially run a shadow government in Gaza since 2007. After the failure of a unity government, there was a brief but bloody battle in Gaza in which Hamas routed Fatah and its Palestinian Authority from the area. Its finances were always mysterious, but they largely dried up after a break with Iran over the Syrian civil war and, especially, Egypt\u2019s shutting of thousands of smuggling tunnels since the ascendancy of its military-backed government last summer.The inability to pay government salaries, along with soaring unemployment and fuel shortages worsened by the tunnel closings, were prime reasons Hamas agreed to reconciliation terms it had repeatedly rejected before.Yet the agreement Hamas and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed in April left to a committee the problem of reconciling the two sets of workers, which several Palestinian officials acknowledge far exceed the number the government can afford to cover Gaza\u2019s 1.7 million residents.With a $1.3 billion deficit in the Palestinian Authority\u2019s $4.6 billion budget for 2014, Mr. Hamdallah said, \u201cI made clear and the president made clear that we cannot afford to pay.\u201dEhab Bessaiso, a government spokesman, said Qatar had agreed to donate $60 million over three months \u2014 perhaps 40 percent of what is needed \u2014 for the Hamas workers. But getting it into their hands is another matter.Washington and other Western capitals said they would continue working with the new government while watching closely to ensure that it did not directly involve Hamas, which they consider a terrorist organization. Banks, too, are wary of facing sanctions if they handle the funds. Robert H. Serry, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, has been trying to negotiate a transfer, but Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, threatened this week to expel him from Jerusalem for doing so.\u201cThere are financial, administrative and political complications,\u201d Mr. Bessaiso said. \u201cThe Qataris always say, \u2018No problem.\u2019 But the problem is in the mechanisms.\u201dMustafa is unworried by it all. He spends days at the beach with his family \u2014 \u201cthis is our only escape,\u201d he said \u2014 and, lately, evenings smoking shisha at another cafe, watching World Cup matches. For Ramadan, he plans to stay up all night, indulge in the pre-dawn meal, then sleep through the hot hours.Mr. Samouni will be at work, worrying about how to buy groceries for the celebratory iftar dinners. On Wednesday, his wife, Imam, 44, showed a refrigerator bare but for a few tomatoes, a jar of tomato sauce, a dish of dried thyme and a loaf of bread.Before getting the government job in 2012, Mr. Samouni made less than $10 a day hawking roasted nuts from a street cart. At $350 a month, he is on the low end of the Hamas pay scale \u2014 the upside being that during the lean months after the military takeover in Egypt, he did not lose much because the minimum each worker received was about $290 ($60 goes to transportation for his nine-mile commute).Except the last two months, when they all got zero. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if we are here or there,\u201d he said, referring to the fact that Hamas has officially stepped away from leading the Gaza ministries, but the new government has not stepped in. \u201cWhat we know is that we are lost.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the salary of Mustafa, a security officer. He earns $520 a month, not $5,200.Fares Akram reported from Gaza City, and Jodi Rudoren from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ruling on Argentina Gives Investors an Upper Hand", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceHard cases, it has often been said, make bad law.That is just what happened this week. The United States Supreme Court, ignoring the pleas of the governments of numerous countries, including the United States, turned the world of sovereign debt restructuring on its head.In so doing, the court most likely damaged the status of New York as the world\u2019s financial capital. It made it far less likely that genuinely troubled countries will be able to restructure their debts. And it increased the power of investors \u2014 often but not solely hedge funds that buy distressed bonds at deep discounts to face value \u2014 to prevent needed restructurings.The case concerned an appeal by Argentina, a country that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit called, with ample reason, \u201ca uniquely recalcitrant debtor.\u201d This is a country that has made default a national habit over the last two centuries, making you wonder why anyone ever lends to it. In the next 10 days, much attention will be focused on whether Argentina will succeed in defying the United States courts. On June 30, there is a scheduled interest payment on a set of Argentine bonds that its government wants to pay. But the courts say that interest may not be paid unless the country pays all it owes on bonds it defaulted on years ago, something Argentina says it cannot and will not do.Argentina\u2019s plan is to convert the bonds on which it wants to make payment into new bonds that would not be subject to New York law. Whether it can pull that off may depend on whether there are banks and other financial institutions willing to risk the ire of American courts.But the fate of Argentina, or its creditors, is not what makes this case important, and perhaps disastrous.To understand why that is, consider the way sovereign debt defaults and restructurings have been handled in the past. There is no equivalent to bankruptcy law for sovereign debtors. When Walter Wriston, the head of Citibank from 1967 to 1984, said \u201ccountries don\u2019t go bankrupt,\u201d he was widely mocked by those who thought he meant that countries don\u2019t go broke and therefore don\u2019t default on their debts. But that was not what he said.There is no legal procedure to resolve debts of destitute countries. There is no court to approve a restructuring plan that will wipe out some debts and convert others to equity, as there is for companies.Instead, there has been a sometimes messy system, called \u201chiggledy piggledy\u201d by Anna Gelpern, a professor of international law at Georgetown. Troubled countries negotiate with lenders \u2014 banks in the old days, and bondholders more recently \u2014 to restructure the debts. That restructuring could involve reducing the amount owed, lowering the interest rate, extending the maturity of the debt or some combination of the three. The International Monetary Fund would often be involved, providing emergency funds that were contingent on government reforms needed to put the country on a financially sustainable path for the future. It was understood that the I.M.F. money \u2014 similar to \u201cdebtor-in-possession financing\u201d loans made to companies after they file for bankruptcy \u2014 ranked above old debts.Bondholders could, and did, hold out. But they faced the risk that the restructuring would go through and those who agreed would get (partial) payouts, while the holdouts got none. Sometimes, if there were a small number of holdouts, the government might choose to pay them off to avoid future problems. If not, the holdouts could go to court. Which court depended on clauses in the bonds. If it was a court in the country borrowing the money, the creditors were at a severe disadvantage. But if it was in New York, the holdouts could normally get a court order directing the country to pay.The catch was that the order was usually unenforceable. Countries had sovereign immunity for many of their assets located abroad. A defaulting country might have an embassy on valuable property in Washington, but that was off limits.In the Argentine case, the hedge funds suing the country have tried, generally in vain, to find assets they could seize. They managed to briefly gain control of an Argentine ship in Ghana, but that was released. It was, said Ms. Gelpern, an \u201cinformal system that has worked reasonably well, and has allowed most governments to restructure their bonds, at more or less reasonable cost.\u201dNow it has changed, at least for countries that issue bonds under New York law.The hand of holdouts has been strengthened immensely. Under the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, holdouts cannot fare any worse than those who agree to a restructuring \u2014 and they can do much better. The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of that decision.If that order can be enforced, there may be no way to restructure sovereign debts.But can it be enforced? Perhaps it can. The courts say that Bank of New York, the payment agent for the bonds, would be in contempt if it aided the payment to holders of restructured bonds without paying the old bonds as well. And the courts want to extend that requirement around the world. Euroclear, a company based in Belgium, says the law there would require it to transmit any payment that a customer ordered. But the American court order says Euroclear must not do any such thing for Argentina.\u201cFinancial market service providers,\u201d Ms. Gelpern said, \u201care now sovereign debt enforcement agents.\u201dIt is at least possible that the Second Circuit opinion could, in the future, be used to keep the I.M.F. from having a preferential standing over the holdouts in any restructuring that did occur. The United States government told lower courts that this could create big problems. It could lead to countries choosing to borrow under English law, rather than New York law, and thus diminish the role of New York as a world financial center. That, the government said, could have \u201ca detrimental effect on the systemic role of the U.S. dollar.\u201dThe ruling, added the government, \u201ccould enable a single creditor to thwart the implementation of an internationally supported restructuring plan, and thereby undermine the decades of effort the United States has expended to encourage a system of cooperative resolution of international debt crises.\u201dThe Second Circuit opinion, by Judge Barrington D. Parker, brushed aside such worries, suggesting that Argentina was a uniquely bad borrower and saying that enforcement of the rule of law would make New York more attractive for international lenders. And, he added, most international bonds issued in the last decade have \u201ccollective action clauses,\u201d allowing a supermajority of bondholders to force holdouts to accept a restructuring, meaning the problem had already been solved.Countries including Brazil, France and Mexico told the Supreme Court that was nonsense. First, there are still plenty of old bonds without such clauses. Second, collective action clauses normally operate bond issue by bond issue. So it may be possible for holdouts to buy enough of one small issue to block a restructuring that an overwhelming majority of creditors supported.What would happen then? In a brief submitted to the Supreme Court, Joseph Stiglitz, the Columbia University professor who was formerly chief economist of the World Bank, offered a warning: \u201cUnable to restructure, governments that default would be permanently shut out from the debt market, with consequential adverse effects on development and economic growth prospects.\u201dWhat did the Supreme Court think of those arguments? Evidently, not much. It declined to hear Argentina\u2019s appeal, or even to ask the United States government for its views. The court did decide a related, but far less important, case. That decision will make it easier for the hedge funds suing Argentina to force it to reveal information on assets it owns around the world, in hope that vulnerable assets will be uncovered.It is hard to muster much sympathy for Argentina, which chose to cram down a brutal restructuring plan years after defaulting, when it reasonably could have been more generous. But this decision is likely to hurt countries whose financial problems are much more serious. It may lead some of them to try to get out from under an American court system that appears to be committed to the 21st-century equivalent of a debtor\u2019s prison for countries confronting an oppressive debt burden.That is not the way Judge Parker would put it. \u201cWe believe,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat the interest \u2014 widely shared in the financial community \u2014 in maintaining New York\u2019s status as one of the foremost commercial centers is advanced by requiring debtors, including foreign debtors, to pay their debts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roy Goodman, Liberal Republican Stalwart in New York, Dies at 84", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoy M. Goodman, a longtime New York State senator who was once the heir apparent to the liberal Republicans who dominated state politics in the 1960s and was later a courtly leader of that faction as it was pushed to the party\u2019s margins, died on Tuesday in Danbury, Conn. He was 84.His daughter Leslie Goodman said he died of respiratory failure in a hospital there while on his way home to Manhattan after attending a grandson\u2019s graduation from the Harvard Business School.In Mr. Goodman\u2019s more than three decades representing the East Side of Manhattan, his was a leading voice for legal abortion, rent regulations, gay rights, opposition to the death penalty and even legalized prostitution. He never cracked the inner circle of a Republican Senate majority, which was well to his right, yet he left a large imprint. He was a conduit to Albany for two generations of Republican and Democratic mayors, the primary author of important changes in the New York City Charter and an avid and press-savvy conductor of investigations.But Mr. Goodman\u2019s undisguised ambitions for higher office \u2014 he variously angled to be mayor, United States senator, a cabinet officer and state comptroller \u2014 were thwarted. As a younger man, he said, he had expected to succeed Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York, in Washington.When Mr. Goodman entered politics, power in New York resided in a group of moderate-to-liberal Republicans with deep Manhattan roots: Mayor John V. Lindsay, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz and Senator Javits. They promoted Mr. Goodman\u2019s fortunes, but by the midpoint of his career he was not their inheritor, it appeared, but rather the last of their kind. His party was moving right and away from the aristocratic elite that Mr. Goodman embodied.His district \u2014 long a bastion of silk-stocking Republicanism \u2014 was also changing, becoming more Democratic. Slowed by age and back problems, he resigned in 2002, after 33 years in the State Senate, one of the longest tenures in the chamber\u2019s history. Mr. Goodman cut a rare figure. His every statement advertised that he was a blue blood, with his clench-jawed diction, dated vocabulary and patrician circumlocutions. To Mr. Goodman, wrongdoers might be \u201cbounders\u201d or \u201ccads,\u201d and drivers were \u201cchauffeurs.\u201d He tossed off French and Latin phrases and startling similes. \u201cIf we leave this room like an explosion in a paint factory,\u201d he once said, \u201cthen we\u2019ll have a real shiner.\u201dA fellow politician once said he was \u201clike a P. G. Wodehouse character wandering through a scene from \u2018Kojak.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHe struck some people as a snob, and he was unabashed about having a sizable ego. Some Senate colleagues preyed on his air of self-importance with practical jokes, but even his critics called him intelligent and well-meaning. He could be disarmingly upbeat and poke fun at himself. During an ill-fated run for mayor, when successive polls showed him with 5 percent and 6 percent voter support, Mr. Goodman exulted: \u201cSix percent! That\u2019s marvelous. That\u2019s a 20 percent improvement!\u201d After his razor-thin re-election in 2000, he labeled himself \u201cLandslide Goodman.\u201dMr. Goodman\u2019s fortune came primarily from his grandfather, Israel Matz, a Jewish immigrant who built a drug manufacturing business primarily around one product: Ex-Lax. Israel\u2019s daughter, Alice, married Bernard Goodman, a surgeon, and Roy Matz Goodman was born on March 5, 1930.He grew up on the Upper East Side, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and an M.B.A. at Harvard, and then served as an officer in the Navy. In 1955, he married Barbara Furrer, and they had three children. She died in 2006.Besides his daughter Leslie, he is survived by another daughter, Claire Pellegrini-Cloud; a son, Randolph; and six grandchildren. In the early 1960s, after a short stint in investment banking, Mr. Goodman joined the family business, becoming president of Ex-Lax Inc. at age 32. He sold the business several years later, reportedly for $40 million.In 1965 he worked on Mr. Lindsay\u2019s mayoral campaign. When Mr. Lindsay won, he made him the city\u2019s finance administrator. Vowing to find places to save money, Mr. Goodman made a well-publicized tour of city facilities like hospitals and jails. Afterward, he told reporters: \u201cI didn\u2019t find what I was looking for. There\u2019s no room for economies there. All I found was a crying need for more facilities, more personnel, higher salaries \u2014 well, more money.\u201dIt was a remarkable statement that could be taken as a prelude to Mr. Lindsay\u2019s mayoralty, though the worst of that administration\u2019s unsound borrowing and spending habits took hold after Mr. Goodman left.In 1968, Mr. Goodman quit City Hall to run for a vacant State Senate seat, and won. Governor Rockefeller and Mayor Lindsay were at odds, so Mr. Goodman, on good terms with both men, became a go-between, a role he would play many times when governors and mayors feuded. In a Senate controlled by upstate and suburban lawmakers, he became the go-to legislator for city mayors.In his first legislative session, Mr. Goodman won a significant victory for Mr. Lindsay over the opposition of the powerful policemen\u2019s union. He led an effort to repeal a 1911 law that required the city to schedule officers in three equal shifts around the clock, making it impossible to assign more officers to the hours when they were most needed.In 1970, he served as Senate floor leader for an abortion legalization bill that passed unexpectedly, making New York one of the first states to take that step. He also sponsored laws making it easier to get divorced. As chairman of the Committee on Housing and Urban Development, he introduced a flurry of pro-tenant bills in his first years, several of which were enacted, including measures making co-op conversions more difficult and protecting renters in those buildings.Liberal Republicanism seemed ascendant when Mr. Goodman first went to Albany, but in fact it was beginning a steep decline. By 1980, Mr. Lindsay, Mr. Javits, Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Lefkowitz were gone, replaced by Democrats or conservative Republicans.Mr. Goodman\u2019s own power and prominence peaked in the mid-1970s, when he headed a commission to revise the City Charter. Most of the panel\u2019s members were Democrats, who viewed him warily and fought among themselves. Mayor Abraham D. Beame, a Democrat, opposed the commission at every turn. Yet Mr. Goodman corralled the group behind a set of recommendations, and city voters adopted them in 1975, at the height of the fiscal crisis. The charter revisions greatly expanded the power of community boards, required balanced budgets and public disclosure of labor contracts, loosened mayoral control of spending and gave the city comptroller broad power to audit agencies.Mr. Goodman ran for mayor in 1977, and at first he was seen as a legitimate contender who was likely to be nominated by the Republican and Liberal Parties. But the Liberals backed Mario M. Cuomo instead. A radio talk-show host, Barry Farber, mounted a serious challenge to Mr. Goodman in the Republican primary. Other Republican officials declined to support him. In the general election, he drew just 4 percent of the vote, far behind Mr. Cuomo and the winner, Edward I. Koch.Back in the Senate, Mr. Goodman became chairman of the Committee on Investigations. He conducted a string of inquiries that contributed to changes in a wide range of state rules. One instituted new medical precautions at boxing matches; another tightened controls on investments by public authorities. He also established himself as Albany\u2019s chief advocate for arts institutions and state spending on the arts. The first President George Bush later named him to the National Council on the Arts.In 1981, Mr. Goodman became the Republican Party chairman for Manhattan. He held that post for two decades, relishing his role as host to Republicans from around the country at fund-raising dinners. But when county chairmen got together to choose citywide or statewide candidates, Mr. Goodman usually had little sway.Mr. Goodman\u2019s relations with his party were complicated, but he was ever the good soldier. He lamented the rise of more conservative Republicans, but raised money for them. He often sided with Republican legislators on crime and taxes, and though he opposed them on social issues, he refused to vote for Democratic motions to force those issues to the Senate floor. He served long enough to see the enactment of laws on measures he had long supported, like gay rights and gun control, and others he opposed, like a restored death penalty and erosion of rent regulations.After Mr. Goodman left the Senate, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki made him president of the United Nations Development Corporation, an agency that sought to build new offices for the United Nations and a park along the East River. But his former colleagues, the state Senate Republicans, held up the plan as a protest against corruption at the United Nations.\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege of working with giants, and I\u2019ve endured some people who were, shall we say, smaller,\u201d Mr. Goodman said in an interview during that time. \u201cI\u2019ve survived long enough to see the pendulum swing wide to one side and then the other, and sometimes back again.\u201dPeter Keepnews contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finding Shock Absorbers for Student Debt", "Date": "2014-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewI agree wholeheartedly. But while Mr. Obama\u2019s initiative is a step in the right direction, it doesn\u2019t go far enough. First, consider the scale of the problem. Forty million people hold student loans. With outstanding debt at $1 trillion, student loans have surpassed credit cards as the third-largest form of household debt. Seven million borrowers are in default and more are behind on their payments. On the bright side, borrowing has risen largely because there are more college students than there used to be. College is a great investment; on average, it pays a better return than stocks or bonds. But investments carry risk. Why are so many borrowers in distress? Recent graduates had the bad luck of graduating into a recession. Economists call this \u201ccohort risk\u201d: good or bad luck shared by birth groups. Tough job markets are hard on young people, who bear the brunt of unemployment and dropping wages. In the long term, for the typical borrower, things will work out. College is worth it. But how can we help in the short term? We should allow student-loan payments to rise and fall with income, as we do with Social Security and taxes. If borrowers hit a tough spell, payments should drop automatically. If they score well-paying jobs, payments should rise. This is called \u201cincome-based repayment.\u201dA guide to student loans at various universities, and what it takes after graduation to repay that debt.A typical person graduating with a B.A. degree has $30,000 in debt requiring a monthly payment of $350. That\u2019s 9 percent of a typical $45,000 salary for a B.A. holder 25 to 34 years old. But there is much variation around \u201ctypical.\u201d When a salary is $25,000, the monthly payment jumps to 17 percent of pretax earnings. Factor in taxes and health insurance, and loan payments can devour a big chunk of take-home pay.In theory, the Pay As You Earn program, or PAYE, which Mr. Obama expanded in his order on Monday, should hold payments to 10 percent of income. But because payments don\u2019t adjust automatically, they can actually consume a much larger share of a borrower\u2019s earnings in a given year. How would such a system work in the United States? Invisibly. We don\u2019t do much paperwork to pay our Social Security contributions: We fill out an initial W-4 form and our employer handles the rest. Loan payments can be handled the same way. Even if we can get more distressed borrowers into PAYE, the program does not provide effective protection against earnings risk. Why? Relief comes too late; it\u2019s as if unemployment benefits arrive a year after someone becomes unemployed. In PAYE, loan payments are calculated as 10 percent of the previous year\u2019s disposable income. But income can change significantly \u2014 and often \u2014 over the course of a year. For those patching together several part-time jobs, hours and earnings can bounce around weekly. In PAYE, and all the other income-based repayment programs, every change to earnings requires a new application to adjust the loan payment. The program is simply not built to deal with the earnings instability that is typical for young workers, particularly those graduating into a tough economy.Some will argue that an automatically adjusting system creates a temptation for students to work in low-paying jobs, to avoid paying their loans. \u201cMoral hazard,\u201d the mirror image of insurance, arises when we reduce the pain caused by adverse events like injury and low earnings. Insurance may cause people to do less to avoid these events \u2014 by driving more carelessly, or not searching for a well-paying job. Putting all the risk on individuals minimizes moral hazard, while placing the risk on the insurer maximizes it. All insurance programs \u2014 health, auto, income \u2014 have to find a balance along this spectrum. There is no perfect answer. The choice is less a matter of economic efficiency and more a matter of tastes, politics and values. My take is that we have loaded too much risk onto student borrowers. It\u2019s time for more insurance. Now an aside: Cutting interest rates is an ineffective and expensive form of insurance. Even a big rate decrease has little effect on monthly payments: A cut to 3.5 percent from 6.5 percent reduces the monthly payment on a $30,000 debt by only $44. Yet the cut is expensive because everyone gets it, even if they\u2019re doing splendidly. Governments once assumed almost all the risk of college by heavily subsidizing its cost. In the face of tax revolts and stressed state budgets, however, that support has faltered. Because real incomes are falling or stagnant for most families, even moderate increases in college costs eat up an increasing share of resources. Without a major recommitment to public funding for college, higher debt is the new reality. Protecting student borrowers against economic risk is a sound way to keep young people investing in education.

{"Headline": "A Paltry Start in Curbing Global Warming", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneTim Jackson, professor of sustainable development at the University of Surrey in Britain, uses a nifty back-of-the-envelope calculation to underscore the challenge of giving the world\u2019s poor a shot at prosperity while preventing a global climate disaster.Let\u2019s accept, he proposes, that citizens of developing nations are entitled to become roughly as rich in 2050 as Europeans. Let\u2019s take note that the world will be home to more than nine billion people by then.What would it take, then, to prevent the Earth\u2019s temperature from rising more than 3.6 degrees \u2014 2 degrees Celsius \u2014 above its level before the industrial era, which is generally considered the limit beyond which global warming risks violent and unpredictable environmental upheaval to the world we all share?Assuming incomes in Europe grow 2 percent a year between now and then, Professor Jackson calculates, by 2050 the world economy could emit at most six grams of carbon dioxide for every dollar it produced.We are nowhere near that efficient. Advanced nations emit 60 times that much, according to the Energy Information Administration. Developing nations emit 90 times that much. It\u2019s enough to make a sustainable development expert despair.\u201cAre we really committed to eradicating poverty? Are we serious about reducing carbon emissions? De we genuinely care about resource scarcity, deforestation, biodiversity loss?\u201d Mr. Jackson wrote. \u201cOr are we so blinded by conventional wisdom that we daren\u2019t do the sums for fear of revealing the truth?\u201dGrowth, he concluded, is \u201cecologically unsustainable.\u201d We must start thinking about how to live without it.Mr. Jackson\u2019s observation came vividly to mind this week when the Obama administration unveiled its much-anticipated rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions at the nation\u2019s power plants.\u201cIt really does send a signal to the rest of the world,\u201d said Kevin Kennedy, head of the United States Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute, a research organization devoted to sustainable development. \u201cIt reinforces for many international players that the United States is going to be a serious player.\u201dOnce one gets past the initial enthusiasm, however, the proposal falls far short of the standard scientists have set. The numbers, to put it in Professor Jackson\u2019s terms, don\u2019t quite add up.It is not a number to dismiss easily, particularly given the political and economic challenges that stand in the way of achieving it. Power plants are the biggest carbon polluters in the country. But the number is also not as big as it looks. For starters, half the job has been done already. By 2012, the recession and the electricity industry\u2019s switch from coal to less-polluting natural gas had cut power generators\u2019 emissions by almost 16 percent from their level in 2005.What\u2019s more, on their own, the new targets fall short of the promise President Obama first made at the world\u2019s climate summit in Copenhagen five years ago and pledged formally at a summit in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, the following year: that by 2020 the United States\u2019 total greenhouse gas emissions would be 17 percent lower than in 2005.Indeed. Rather than a bold stride into the vanguard of the battle against climate change, the new proposals from the E.P.A. offer just enough progress to shuffle along with a world that unfailingly falls short of delivering what is needed.The models reviewed by the I.P.C.C. suggest that to make it \u201cas likely as not\u201d that global temperatures remain below the 2-degree threshold throughout this century, we may need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half by 2050 \u2014 only 36 years from now \u2014 and much more after that.The problem is, we haven\u2019t even started. In the first decade of this century, emissions actually grew at twice the pace of the preceding three decades, fueled mostly by China and its vast appetite for coal. And even if every country, including the United States, were to deliver on the pledges made in Canc\u00fan, the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 would still be greater than in 2005.This is not to discount the political boldness of the Obama administration\u2019s proposal. The mining and energy companies that stand to lose money from the rules will almost certainly take them to court. They will be assailed mercilessly in Congress, where energy corporations have good friends and where a big chunk of the Republican Party does not believe in the science of climate change.It is not to minimize the diplomatic obstacles to a deal on how to share the burden.It is certainly not to minimize the technological challenge. The most efficient mitigation paths evaluated by the I.P.C.C. rely on the deployment of technologies that don\u2019t really exist yet on the scale needed. For instance, in the absence of large-scale carbon capture and storage, the economic cost of staying below the 2-degree limit would more than double.But the Earth doesn\u2019t care about any of this.What makes all this dithering so agonizing is that staying under the 2-degree ceiling would be surprisingly affordable, if the world started now to make reasonable emission cuts, while investing in developing the future technologies that could largely replace fossil fuels by the end of the century. According to the I.P.C.C report, the effort would slow the growth in the world\u2019s annual consumption by no more than 0.14 percentage points, a tiny portion of the typical 3 to 4 percent annual rise in global output.Even Professor Jackson\u2019s tough calculus may be easier to solve than he expected. Based on the most recent I.P.C.C. report, the decline in carbon intensity required to achieve his egalitarian growth target by midcentury without breaching the 2-degree ceiling could be less than half of what he estimated.And yet to make progress one must first take the road. Baby steps will not take the world where we need to go.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paying the Price for Inaction on Immigration", "Date": "2014-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Conservative Republicans think the immigration issue has turned to their benefit, removing even the slim prospects for any action this year. If they\u2019re right, it\u2019s only for the short term.Vocal Republicans accuse the Obama administration of creating a minicrisis with the recent surge of children who have come across the southwestern border from Central America. It\u2019s the latest rationale of a determined bloc of House Republicans for killing a Senate-passed immigration overhaul bill \u2014 led by John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York \u2014 which provided a lengthy pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants.The longer-term situation is unchanged and will only get worse. The uncertainty over a broken immigration system will persist, further frustrating American businesses and taking a toll on the economy. Politically, this probably will strengthen the Democrats\u2019 hold on the fast-growing Hispanic and Asian-American populations.The last time Washington failed to act on an immigration overhaul, in 2007, Democrats, including then-Senator Barack Obama, as well as Republicans, helped sabotage a measure advocated by President George W. Bush, Senator McCain and Senator Edward M. Kennedy.This time, the opponents are Republicans. There are about 250 votes in the House to pass the Senate bill now, but most of those are Democrats, and Speaker John Boehner won\u2019t consider a measure opposed by the majority of his caucus.For much of the year, Republicans, trying to escape blame for scuttling a measure, have said passage would be impossible because of the Obama administration\u2019s lax border policies.In fact, the budget for border security has increased more than 50 percent over the past five years, and there are almost 4,000 more agents.These critics got new ammunition this year when a surge of unaccompanied children, mainly from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, began coming over illegally. Republicans attributed the influx to Mr. Obama\u2019s decision two years ago to provide work permits to the so-called Dreamers: immigrants who had come as children with their families before 2012 and had been living in the United States for at least five years, were enrolled in school and hadn\u2019t had any criminal violations.Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, said that policy created \u201ca real magnet\u201d for the latest surge of children, who thought they would be able to get citizenship if they made it across the border.The Dreamers measure doesn\u2019t affect citizenship. Other facts undercut Mr. Issa\u2019s case. The vast majority of these kids are from those three Central American countries where the murder rates are among the five highest in the world. To be sure, some smugglers falsely tell these children they can get work permits in the United States, but it\u2019s the conditions in their countries of origin that provide the incentive for these kids to make the journey, far more than a two-year-old administrative action.Moreover, as Mr. Schumer and Mr. McCain note, the Senate-approved immigration measure, which contains billions more for enforcement and adjudication, would make it much easier to deal with the surge.The other objective of anti-immigration forces is to keep Mr. Obama from taking other executive actions, such as allowing more prosecutorial discretion in immigration cases and modestly expanding the Dreamers program. They may succeed here because even some Democrats caution against doing much in the current climate.Looking ahead, right-wing Republicans dismiss the warnings of Mr. McCain and the United States Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Tom Donohue that the party will forfeit the 2016 presidential race if it deep-sixes immigration reform.

{"Headline": "Target Gives a Defense of Its Efforts on Security", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn advance of next week\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, Target on Monday defended its management and oversight of customer data despite the extensive hacking it experienced last year. In a letter to shareholders filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Roxanne Austin, the interim chairwoman of Target\u2019s board, listed steps the company had taken toward increasing information security since the breach last year, and she described the security apparatus in place before the attack.\u201cBreaches are occurring across the economy and are affecting a wide range of victims including the U.S. government, the technology and defense industries and more traditional companies, like retailers,\u201d the letter said. \u201cYour board fully recognizes the importance of its oversight responsibilities in this area. Under the board\u2019s leadership and oversight, Target took significant action to address evolving cybercrime risks before the breach.\u201dLast week, an influential shareholder advisory group, Institutional Shareholder Services, said that the majority of Target\u2019s directors did not deserve to be re-elected because they had not provided sufficient risk oversight before the breach. I.S.S. recommended that shareholders vote against seven of the 10 board members, including Ms. Austin. Before the breach, which exposed the data of tens of millions of Target customers, the company spent hundreds of millions of dollars on network security in areas like technology and personnel and had a staff of more than 300 information security employees, Ms. Austin said. That was double the staff it had in that area five years ago. It also required data security training for all employees every year and had a security operations center staffed at all hours to keep an eye out for suspicious activity, among other measures.Ms. Austin\u2019s letter also highlighted steps the company had taken in response since the breach was revealed in December, including accelerating its conversion to a more secure payment-card technology on its branded cards and in its stores and hiring a new chief information officer.The letter did not address other significant personnel changes made at the company in recent months, including the resignation of the chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel. A search is underway for his replacement. The chief information officer at the time of the breach, Beth M. Jacob, resigned as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why World War I Matters to Today\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2014-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHistory LessonsIt is easy, as an American living in the 21st century, not to care that 100 years ago today, a 19-year-old Serb named Gavrilo Princip shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, setting in motion the catastrophe that was the First World War.To many Americans, World War I was a muddled, confusing clash of powers that you moved through as quickly as possible in a long-ago history class on the way to studying World War II, which offers a comparatively simple good-versus-evil narrative, greater American involvement and riveting archival films.But when you want to understand why the world is as it is \u2014 the backdrop of some of the most important economic and diplomatic challenges of our era \u2014 the Great War is the first place in history to look. The clash of Russia and Ukraine; the euro zone debt crisis; and the civil wars in Syria and Iraq all have direct antecedents in the conflict that began exactly a century ago.More fundamentally, the conflict showed how fragile a liberal world order can be. The world, circa 1913, looked pretty great. The industrial revolution was raising living standards across Europe, democracy gradually becoming entrenched in more countries, and nations had become deeply intertwined by trade and financial interconnections.There were rumblings that a clash could be on the way, as the emerging power of Germany chafed against the old order of things. As conflict began in the summer and fall of 1914, a common view was that the skirmish would be over by Christmas. Instead, it was perhaps the greatest unforced error in modern human history, exacting a vast toll for what, with hindsight, was not much of a purpose at all.World War I not only lasted four years and cost perhaps 15 million lives on its own. It also sowed the seeds for the Great Depression, the rise of the Nazis and World War II. The Second World War can even be properly viewed as a redo, the price that was paid for botching the end of the first one. (It was evident to some at the time; John Maynard Keynes\u2019s \u201cEconomic Consequences of the Peace,\u201d written in 1919, is an uncannily prescient look at the forces unleashed by the Treaty of Versailles.)With the generation of men and women who witnessed the war almost all deceased, and the events themselves receding into the category of distant history, it is all the more important for us to understand the lessons of that period. I did so only when researching a book on the 2007 to 2012 financial crisis and the history of central banking, when it again and again became clear that to understand those recent events, particularly those concerning the near-collapse of the euro zone, I had to reach back a century to the (failed) economic diplomacy of that era.What are these lessons for today?It is a clich\u00e9, but an accurate one, that in dealing with Russia\u2019s aggression toward Ukraine, Americans have been inclined to apply the lessons of World War II (don\u2019t let territorial aggression go unchecked) where European allies have applied the lessons of World War I (don\u2019t allow tit-for-tat escalation to take hold). Americans could do well to understand that both experiences offer important lessons in how to deal with an expansionist autocrat.The global monetary system evolved in no small part in reaction to the failures of the Great War, starting with the Bretton Woods accords of 1944 that was something of a do-over after the mistakes of Versailles.But the lesson of the Great War is that this state of the world isn\u2019t something we should take for granted. Rather, it\u2019s something that every national leader, and every voter, should feel urgency to defend. The need to learn those lessons is why we study history to begin with, and one hopes the centennial of World War I can bring more people to come to grips with an episode in human history we might prefer to forget.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy May Be Improving. Worker Pay Isn\u2019t.", "Date": "2014-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Recovery in Need of a RecoveryThe latest economic data out Tuesday morning was generally good. Home building activity remained above the one million a year rate. Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in May, such that inflation over the last year is now 2.1 percent, about in line with what the Federal Reserve aims for.But that inflation news carried with it a depressing side note. Now that the Consumer Price Index for May has been published, it is possible to determine inflation-adjusted hourly earnings for the month. And the number is not good.Average hourly earnings for private sector American workers rose about 49 cents an hour over the last year, to $24.38 in May. But that wasn\u2019t enough to cover inflation over the year, so in real or inflation-adjusted terms, hourly worker pay fell 0.1 percent over the last 12 months. Weekly pay shows the same story, also falling 0.1 percent in the year ended in May.Pause for just a second to consider that. Five years after the economic recovery began, American workers have gone the last 12 months without any real increase in what they are paid.By the same measure cited above \u2014 average hourly earnings for private sector workers \u2014 the year that ended in February showed a strong 2.1 percent gain in pay versus only 1.1 percent inflation, which works out to a 1 percent annual gain in real hourly pay. That was the strongest in five years, and if it had been sustained would have been great news for American workers.But it was not sustained. The numbers since then suggest two things: The strong gain in hourly pay reported for the 12 months ended in February looks to have been an anomaly. And while inflation has picked up since then, reducing the value of workers\u2019 paychecks, worker pay has only barely kept up with the higher prices.The latest numbers should give pause to any Federal Reserve officials who see wage pressures as evidence that the economy is overheating. It might have been arguably true earlier in the year. It might prove true later in the year, if workers start successfully demanding wage increases in excess of inflation.But for right now, the evidence points to more of what we\u2019ve seen for most of the last six years: Employees have little negotiating power to demand higher pay.Advertisement"}

Patent claims over the way ideas are incorporated into computers, cellphones and other devices have become a challenge for many high-tech companies.Justice Thomas indicated that the decision posed no threat to the concept of software patents. \u201cThere is no dispute,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat many computer-implemented claims are formally addressed to patent-eligible subject matter.\u201dMany technology companies have interests that tug in opposite directions. They tend to hold large portfolios of valuable patents and want to protect them. But they must also contend with \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d companies that have obtained patents on sometimes vague concepts and that are more active in the courthouse than on the production line.The patents were challenged by CLS Bank International, which says it clears $5 trillion in foreign exchange transactions a day using methods to ensure that both sides performed.

{"Headline": "The True Cost of Hidden Money", "Date": "2014-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorGABRIEL ZUCMAN is a 27-year-old French economist who decided to solve a puzzle: Why do international balance sheets each year show more liabilities than assets, as if the world is in debt to itself? Over the last couple of decades, the few international economists who have addressed this question have offered a simple explanation: tax evasion. Money that, say, leaves the United States for an offshore tax shelter is recorded as a liability here, but it is listed nowhere as an asset \u2014 its mission, after all, is disappearance. But until now the economists lacked hard numbers to confirm their suspicions. By analyzing data released in recent years by central banks in Switzerland and Luxembourg on foreigners\u2019 bank holdings, then extrapolating to other tax havens, Mr. Zucman has put creditable numbers on tax evasion, showing that it\u2019s rampant \u2014 and a major driver of wealth inequality.Mr. Zucman estimates \u2014 conservatively, in his view \u2014 that $7.6 trillion \u2014 8 percent of the world\u2019s personal financial wealth \u2014 is stashed in tax havens. If all of this illegally hidden money were properly recorded and taxed, global tax revenues would grow by more than $200 billion a year, he believes. And these numbers do not include much larger corporate tax avoidance, which usually follows the letter but hardly the spirit of the law. According to Mr. Zucman\u2019s calculations, 20 percent of all corporate profits in the United States are shifted offshore, and tax avoidance deprives the government of a third of corporate tax revenues. Corporate tax avoidance has become so widespread that from the late 1980s until now, the effective corporate tax rate in the United States has dropped from 30 percent to 15 percent, Mr. Zucman found, even though the tax rate hasn\u2019t changed.Mr. Zucman, an assistant economics professor at the London School of Economics, is part of a wave of data-focused economists led by his mentor, Thomas Piketty, of the Paris School of Economics. Mr. Zucman\u2019s short book on tax evasion, \u201cThe Missing Wealth of Nations,\u201d was a best seller in France last year. Mr. Zucman\u2019s tax evasion numbers are big enough to upend common assumptions, like the notion that China has become the world\u2019s \u201cowner\u201d while Europe and America have become large debtors. The idea of the rich world\u2019s indebtedness is \u201can illusion caused by tax havens,\u201d Mr. Zucman wrote in a paper published last year. In fact, if offshore assets were properly measured, Europe would be a net creditor, and American indebtedness would fall from 18 percent of gross domestic product to 9 percent. Only multinational corporations and people with at least $50 million in financial assets usually have the resources to engage in offshore tax evasion. Since the less wealthy continue paying taxes, the practice deepens wealth inequality. Indeed, newly invigorated efforts in the United States to curb personal tax evasion, codified in the 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, have armed the Internal Revenue Service with strong sanctions to levy on foreign banks that fail to disclose accounts held by American residents. This has made it \u201cmore difficult for moderately wealthy individuals to dodge taxes,\u201d Mr. Zucman says, while the richest account holders still have more elaborate evasive techniques at their disposal. \u201cThere\u2019s a profound shift in attitudes that happened in the 1980s,\u201d Mr. Zucman says. \u201cIn the \u201950s, \u201960s and \u201970s, taxes were much higher, yet it was not considered normal to try to aggressively minimize your tax bill and even to evade taxes.\u201d He finds it \u201cno coincidence\u201d that the era of widespread tax evasion began in the Reagan era, with the rise of the idea that government is a beast that must be starved.Because large-scale tax evasion skews key economics statistics, it hampers officials\u2019 ability to manage the economy or make policy, Mr. Zucman says. It erodes respect for the law, preventing the government from carrying out one of its essential tasks. And it discourages job creation, since it rewards people and corporations for keeping money overseas, instead of investing it domestically. Despite the obstacles that the tax compliance act faces, Mr. Zucman believes its passage marked a global turning point, starting an era of \u201cremarkable progress\u201d in reducing bank secrecy. Even so, only an international approach has a chance of stopping tax evasion, he says. Its most important feature would be a global financial registry, which would track wealth ownership in the same way that Americans routinely record real estate holdings now. \u201cIf you can\u2019t measure wealth,\u201d Mr. Zucman says, \u201cit\u2019s almost impossible to tax it.\u201dA registry would make it impossible for multinationals to falsely attribute profits to tax havens instead of the countries where the profits should be taxed. The United States and Europe could build momentum for a global registry by establishing national registries for their own residents, perhaps incorporating the idea into the free trade agreement that Europe and the United States are now negotiating. What\u2019s beyond question is that there is no economic, political or moral justification for tax evasion \u2014 it exists only because of the political influence that wealth buys. A society that fails to fight widespread tax evasion proclaims its own corruption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rethinking the Word \u2018Foodie\u2019", "Date": "2014-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a dinner party the other night where people were asked to say a word about themselves, one woman said, \u201cMy name is\u201d \u2014 whatever it was \u2014 \u201cand I\u2019m a foodie.\u201d I cringed.I\u2019m not proud of that visceral reaction; in fact, I think it\u2019s wrong. But I do wish there were a stronger, less demeaning-sounding word than \u201cfoodie\u201d for someone who cares about good food, but as seems so often the case, there is not. Witness the near-meaningless-ness of \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cvegetarian\u201d and the inadequacy of \u201corganic\u201d and \u201cvegan.\u201d But proposing new words is a fool\u2019s game; rather, let\u2019s try to make the word \u201cfoodie\u201d a tad more meaningful.As it stands, many self-described foodies are new-style epicures. And there\u2019s nothing destructive about watching competitive cooking shows, doing \u201canything\u201d to get a table at the trendy restaurant, scouring the web for single-estate farro, or devoting oneself to finding the best food truck. The problem arises when it stops there.More conscious foodies understand that producing food has an effect beyond creating an opportunity for pleasure. And this woman was not atypical: She\u2019s into sustainability (\u201cWe have to grow our food better, right?\u201d), organic (though for all I know this means organic junk food) and local food. She shops at farmers\u2019 markets when she can. She cooks.We can\u2019t ask everyone who likes eating \u2014 which, given enough time and an adequate income, includes everyone I\u2019ve ever met \u2014 to become a food activist. But to increase the consciousness levels of well-intentioned foodies, it might be useful to sketch out what \u201ccaring about good food\u201d means, and to try to move \u201cfoodie\u201d to a place where it refers to someone who gets beyond fun to pay attention to how food is produced and the impact it has.The qualities that characterize good food vary within a narrow range. Good food is real, it\u2019s healthy, it\u2019s produced sustainably, it\u2019s fair and it\u2019s affordable. Maybe it\u2019s prepared at home, though if communal kitchens or restaurants can deliver those qualities, I\u2019m all for that.None of this is complicated, but simple doesn\u2019t mean easy. \u201cReal\u201d means traditional; if it existed 100 years ago, it\u2019s probably real. Hyperprocessed is neither real nor healthy. No single factor is causing our diet-related health crisis, but some things we eat are making us sick and it\u2019s more likely that the culprits are added sugars, not asparagus. So, \u201chealthy\u201d most likely will always be \u201cwhole\u201d or even \u201creal.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean we should eat more watercress because it\u2019s a superfood, high in some supposedly critical nutrient, but it does mean we want to eat more fruits and vegetables. As we know.\u201cSustainable\u201d (or \u201cgreen,\u201d another word that\u2019s been rendered near-meaningless) suggests resource-neutral, or as close to it as we can come. There is farming, not necessarily organic, that puts as much back into the soil as it extracts; it also uses water in a way that will guarantee a supply for the future. We can call that \u201csustainable.\u201d\u201cFair\u201d and \u201caffordable\u201d are very tough. As Margaret Gray discusses in her excellent book, \u201cLabor and the Locavore,\u201d we cannot achieve ethical consistency in producing food without paying attention to labor. (Animals are important too, but I suppose I\u2019m an anthro-chauvinist.) For food to be affordable, people \u2014 all people \u2014 must earn living wages; alternatively, good food must be subsidized. Both conditions would be even better. (As almost every foodie knows, we\u2019re currently subsidizing bad food.)Some of these qualities can be controlled by individuals: Most of us can eat real and healthier food easily enough, and, as it happens, growing such food tends to be more sustainable. On a grand scale, we need societal changes and government support to make this more accessible to everyone. But \u2014 and this is the part I like best \u2014 making good food fair and affordable cannot be achieved without affecting the whole system. These are not just food questions; they are questions of justice and equality and rights, of enhancing rather than restricting democracy, of making a more rational, legitimate economy. In other words, working to make food fair and affordable is an opportunity for this country to live up to its founding principles.So shifting the implications of \u201cfoodie\u201d means shifting our culture to one in which eaters \u2014 that\u2019s everyone \u2014 realize that buying into the current food \u201csystem\u201d means exploiting animals, people and the environment, and making ourselves sick. To change that, we have to change not only the way we behave as individuals but the way we behave as a society. It\u2019s rewarding to find the best pork bun; it\u2019s even more rewarding to fight for a good food system at the same time. That\u2019s what we foodies do.Maureen Dowd is off today.Advertisement"}

If convicted, Mr. Boudou could face up to six years in prison.Mr. Boudou, 51, who is in Cuba on an official trip, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He has said that news media organizations with which the government has long been at odds, especially the Clar\u00edn group, have conspired against him.In remarks to a radio station, one of Mr. Boudou\u2019s lawyers compared the 330-page document detailing the charges, published late Friday by a federal judge, Ariel Lijo, to \u201ca fairy tale told in a fantastical way for the news media to replicate.\u201d He said Mr. Boudou would appeal the charges.Mr. Boudou has also sought to raise doubts about the impartiality of Judge Lijo. Before a hearing this month, he said Judge Lijo \u201cliked to handle his affairs in the darkness of his office\u201d and accused him of acting like a puppet for Clar\u00edn, which publishes the country\u2019s largest newspaper.The charges against Mr. Boudou date to 2010, when he was economy minister. He is accused of taking steps to illegally revive a bankrupt printing company and using a frontman to buy shares in the company, now called Compa\u00f1ia de Valores Sudamericana.The company has printed Argentina\u2019s bank notes and made fliers for the re-election campaign of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in 2011. Amid the corruption claims, the company was nationalized in 2012.Five other people, including Alejandro Vandenbroele, the businessman accused of being Mr. Boudou\u2019s frontman, have also been charged. News reports have described ties between the two men, but Mr. Boudou denies knowing Mr. Vandenbroele.Mr. Boudou was appointed economy minister in 2009, serving in the post for more than two years.

Mr. Boudou is the first sitting vice president here to face corruption charges, according to the local news media. He will remain free while he awaits trial.Concerns about corruption have troubled Argentines during the governments of Mrs. Kirchner and N\u00e9stor Kirchner, her husband and predecessor.\u00a0One economy minister under Mr. Kirchner was sentenced to four years in prison in 2012 after a large amount of cash was found in her office bathroom.

The social issues are tied in because without a democratic system, there is no pressure on the government to change.\u201dA surge of discontent is washing over this harbor city of 7.2 million people, which has long taken pride in its status as an enclave of free enterprise, free speech and independent courts abutting the Chinese mainland. The immediate conflict is about how to elect Hong Kong\u2019s leader, the chief executive. But the underlying resentment voiced by many here is that the city\u2019s political-business machine is rigged against them.\u201cWe want a fair, open and equal election,\u201d said Simon Yau, 50, an employee of a marketing firm, who voted in the referendum. \u201cThe government has sided with corporations, the rich.\u201dIf the city fails to adopt a robustly democratic method for electing the chief executive, the Occupy group has threatened to hold sit-ins and engage in civil disobedience in the city\u2019s financial heart, Central.

China has already said it rejects the proposals for nomination by public petition, which would allow potential candidates to bypass a nominating committee dominated by Beijing loyalists.Another supporter is Anson Chan, 74, Hong Kong\u2019s former chief secretary, the second-highest post in government, who has become increasingly critical of the Hong Kong government and Beijing, warning about what she sees as an erosion of the autonomy that China promised to respect.Alex Chow Yong Kang, 23, the secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, said he had grown up assuming he would follow his father into business, but he was jolted as a high school student in 2008 when he attended a candlelight vigil for those killed in the 1989 crackdown around Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

{"Headline": "Squeezing the Life Out of Airline Travel", "Date": "2014-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the RoadSUMMER is coming, airplanes are fuller than ever, and the airlines are squeezing every penny they can from passengers. Even stalwart fliers like my friend Heather Poole, a flight attendant and author of a humorous memoir about her career (\u201cCruising Altitude: Tales of Crash Pads, Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 35,000 Feet\u201d), are taking a deep breath.I empathize with that feeling. I now approach the thought of a flight with about as much enthusiasm as I might anticipate same-day surgery. For already weary business travelers, it seems as though each new change in airline policy has been for the worse, not better.It\u2019s a complicated formula based on price paid and elite-status level. By linking mileage status to money paid instead of miles flown, United followed a somewhat similar move by Delta Air Lines that will take effect in January. The other major network carrier in the United States, American Airlines, has indicated that it wants to follow suit after it fully integrates its AAdvantage mileage program with that of its recent merger partner, US Airways.Almost every change is being done with an eye toward extracting more revenue from mileage programs. Airlines are also pushing harder to sharply increase revenue from so-called ancillary fees, especially from what they refer to as the \u201cupselling\u201d of coach tickets. Anyone who flies regularly knows that paying the base fare doesn\u2019t reliably get you what the airlines now hilariously refer to as a \u201ccomplimentary\u201d assigned seat. Instead, the airlines are using what they call dynamic pricing to assign a range of additional fees for coach seats. United, for example, boasted to its shareholders that the \u201creal-time positioning\u201d technology it used to assign extra prices on available seats led to an increase of 15 percent in ancillary revenue in the first quarter of 2014.This sort of pricing strategy is also drifting into first-class cabins, where unsold seats traditionally were given as upgrades to frequent fliers who had various elite-status levels. Now, some first-class seats not sold at the usual prices as departure approaches are being offered instead to coach passengers at check-in time, at discount prices.As someone without elite status on any airline, I selfishly welcomed this trend on a recent flight on American Airlines from New Orleans to Dallas on a basic coach ticket. At check-in, a box popped up on my computer offering me a seat in first class for a mere $45 extra. I went for it because I had a checked bag that would have cost me $25 on my coach ticket but would be free in first class. As a result, that first-class upgrade actually cost me $20. Still, in another time, the first-class seat that I bought so cheaply would most likely have been awarded as a free upgrade to a coach passenger who had elite status.With the summer travel surge coming soon, flights will become even more crowded \u2014 if that\u2019s even possible. Already, most flights are flying full on most routes, as indicated by load factors in excess of 87 percent reported for May by United, Delta and American (and 83.7 percent by Southwest).So we gripe, but we trudge to the airport and line up to fly. A few days before that, I had emailed Mr. Manser asking him for perspective on our proclivity to complain about airlines, which, after all, will fly you from Casablanca to New York for about $1,000 in just over eight hours.\u201cColumbus was a business traveler, and so am I,\u201d said Mr. Manser, a self-described adventurer who once bicycled the perimeter of Africa and wrote a book, \u201cAround Africa on My Bicycle,\u201d about the trip. After the couple had made a brief stop in Miami last week before their last hard row to New York, he told me, \u201cI travel economy, mainly.\u201cPeople complain about the eight-hour flight from New York City to London? We spent four months rowing across the North Atlantic,\u201d Mr. Manser said from sea via email. He added, in business travel, \u201cthe three things we all look for: space, space and more space.\u201d In the boat, space is limited, no upgrades are available and \u201cthe restroom is a bucket,\u201d he noted. \u201cDinner service has no choices,\u201d he added. But on the other hand, the fresh fish on the daily menu was \u201cbetter than the best the airlines can serve.\u201dEmail: jsharkey@nytimes.com Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Major Hurdles Still Remain in Trans-Atlantic Trade Talks", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Global TrendsBRUSSELS \u2014 When President Obama announced plans for a wide-ranging trans-Atlantic trade pact early last year, it was welcomed by European Union leaders as a debt-free way to boost economic growth in a region encompassing about half of the global economy. More than a year later, as the leaders of the Group of 7 industrialized nations prepare to meet here, talks on the initiative, called the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, have hit major roadblocks, with opposition growing in both the United States and Europe. The Europeans and Americans have long sought ways to integrate their economies in order to accelerate growth and help them compete with emerging economic superpowers, notably China.When Mr. Obama announced the trade proposal, European officials hailed it as an attempt to go far beyond cutting duties to synchronize regulations for products like automobiles, chemicals, cosmetics, drugs and clothes.The European commissioner for trade, Karel De Gucht, initially called for a preliminary agreement to be reached by late this year. That timetable was hugely ambitious from the start and is now seen as unrealistic.Global leaders at a G-7 summit meeting on Wednesday and Thursday are expected to push trade deals as a fillip for jobs and growth. Mr. Obama may also discuss the pact with his European counterparts at a Thursday morning session on the global economy. But no breakthrough is expected.A major attraction of the deal was that it could help fragile economies on both sides of the Atlantic without increasing pressure on national budgets. That perspective has somewhat shifted.The Europeans, who pushed their American counterparts hard to begin the talks, are finally emerging from their lengthy debt crisis. This has reduced pressure on the euro, their flagship economic project. On the other side of the Atlantic, the United States economy has been primed by cheap energy from domestically produced shale gas, making the country more competitive even in the absence of a trade deal.But the biggest damper on prospects for a deal has been rising public concern that a deal could erode consumer and social protections, said Jan Techau, the director of Carnegie Europe, a research organization based in Brussels. \u201cThere\u2019s still an overwhelming economic rationale in favor of a deal,\u201d said Mr. Techau. \u201cThose who were always against it have just gotten better organized.\u201d The lack of progress \u201cis now about fear more than anything else,\u201d he added. To win over the Parliament, which has vetoed international accords in the past, European negotiators could face intense pressure to demand so many concessions from the United States that negotiations will fail, said Janis A. Emmanouilidis, the director of studies at the European Policy Center, a research organization. \u201cHow interested will the U.S. be if we come up with certain positions which they cannot agree on?\u201d he said. Mr. Obama is also facing reluctance among lawmakers at home to give his administration scope to win straightforward approval for any eventual deal, and the prospect of midterm congressional elections in November has made the White House wary of pushing too hard.Sensing a slowdown, the Business Roundtable and European Round Table of Industrialists in May called on negotiators to redouble their efforts. As talks entered a \u201ccritical phase\u201d the negotiators should \u201ckeep items on the agenda, not remove them,\u201d urged the groups, which include chief executives from companies like General Electric and JPMorgan Chase in the United States, and Siemens and L\u2019Or\u00e9al in Europe.According to a study by the Center for Economic Policy Research, a nonprofit research group based in London, an ambitious deal could significantly strengthen growth in the European Union and the United States by the time its full benefits kick in. Critics like Ferdi De Ville of Ghent University and Gabriel Siles-Br\u00fcgge of the University of Manchester have called that assessment too optimistic. Many Europeans, notably in countries once closely tied to the Soviet Union, like the prospect of tying their economies more closely to the United States. \u201cWe do not have much protest against T.T.I.P. in Latvia and in general we see the U.S. as our strategic ally,\u201d said Valdis Dombrovskis, the former prime minister of Latvia who is a front-runner for his country\u2019s nomination to the European Commission. But many other Europeans harbor acute suspicions of the United States, especially since its spy agencies were revealed to be tracking their communications. They also are angered by the prospect of allowing United States corporations to sue their governments and to offer products and services they regard as undermining European standards.A trade agreement would give the United States \u201cthe last word to impose on us chlorinated chickens, beef with hormones and I don\u2019t know what other environmental nonsense they usually practice in their country,\u201d Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, a French legislator from the National Front, told a rally in May shortly before her far-right party won the largest number of French seats at the European Parliament.

{"Headline": "Why Are We Importing Our Own Fish?", "Date": "2014-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIN 1982 a Chinese aquaculture scientist named Fusui Zhang journeyed to Martha\u2019s Vineyard in search of scallops. The New England bay scallop had recently been domesticated, and Dr. Zhang thought the Vineyard-grown shellfish might do well in China. After a visit to Lagoon Pond in Tisbury, he boxed up 120 scallops and spirited them away to his lab in Qingdao. During the journey 94 died. But 26 thrived. Thanks to them, today China now grows millions of dollars of New England bay scallops, a significant portion of which are exported back to the United States. As go scallops, so goes the nation. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, even though the United States controls more ocean than any other country, 86 percent of the seafood we consume is imported. But it\u2019s much fishier than that: While a majority of the seafood Americans eat is foreign, a third of what Americans catch is sold to foreigners. The seafood industry, it turns out, is a great example of the swaps, delete-and-replace maneuvers and other mechanisms that define so much of the outsourced American economy; you can find similar, seemingly inefficient phenomena in everything from textiles to technology. The difference with seafood, though, is that we\u2019re talking about the destruction and outsourcing of the very ecological infrastructure that underpins the health of our coasts. Let\u2019s walk through these illogical arrangements, course by course.Our most blatant seafood swap has been the abandonment of local American oysters for imported Asian shrimp. Once upon a time, most American Atlantic estuaries (including the estuary we now call the New York Bight) had vast reefs of wild oysters. Many of these we destroyed by the 1800s through overharvesting. But because oysters are so easy to cultivate (they live off wild microalgae that they filter from the water), a primitive form of oyster aquaculture arose up and down our Atlantic coast. Until the 1920s the United States produced two billion pounds of oysters a year. The power of the oyster industry, however, was no match for the urban sewage and industrial dumps of various chemical stews that pummeled the coast at midcentury. Atlantic oyster culture fell to just 1 percent of its historical capacity by 1970. Just as the half-shell appetizer was fading into obscurity, the shrimp cocktail rose to replace it, thanks to a Japanese scientist named Motosaku Fujinaga and the kuruma prawn. Kurumas were favored in a preparation known as \u201cdancing shrimp,\u201d a dish that involved the consumption of a wiggling wild shrimp dipped in sake. Dr. Fujinaga figured out how to domesticate this pricey animal. His graduate students then fanned out across Asia and tamed other varieties of shrimp. Today shrimp, mostly farmed in Asia, is the most consumed seafood in the United States: Americans eat nearly as much of it as the next two most popular seafoods (canned tuna and salmon) combined. Notably, the amount of shrimp we now eat is equivalent to our per capita oyster consumption a century ago. And the Asian aquaculture juggernaut didn\u2019t stop with shrimp. In fact, shrimp was a doorway into another seafood swap, which leads to the next course.Fish Sticks: Atlantic for Pacific Most seafood eaters know the sad story of the Atlantic cod. The ill effects of the postwar buildup of industrialized American fishing are epitomized by that fish\u2019s overexploitation: Gorton\u2019s fish sticks and McDonald\u2019s Filets-o-Fish all once rode on the backs of billions of cod. The codfish populations of North America plummeted and have yet to return. Just as the North Atlantic was falling as a fish-stick producer, the Pacific rose. Beginning in the 1990s two new white fish started coming to us from Asia: tilapia, which grows incredibly fast, and the Vietnamese Pangasius catfish, which grows even faster (and can breathe air if its ponds grow too crowded). These two are now America\u2019s fourth- and sixth-most-consumed seafoods, respectively, according to the National Fisheries Institute. Sending all this wild fish abroad and then importing farmed fish to replace it is enough to make you want to take a stiff drink and go to bed. But when you wake up and reach for your bagel, surprise! The fish swap will get you again.Lox: Wild for FarmedThere was a time when \u201cnova lox\u201d was exactly that: wild Atlantic salmon (laks in Norwegian) caught off Nova Scotia or elsewhere in the North Atlantic. But most wild Atlantic salmon populations have been fished to commercial extinction, and today a majority of our lox comes from selectively bred farmed salmon, with Chile our largest supplier.This is curious, given that salmon are not native to the Southern Hemisphere. But after Norwegian aquaculture companies took them there in the \u201980s, they became so numerous as to be considered an invasive species. The prevalence of imported farmed salmon on our bagels is doubly curious because the United States possesses all the wild salmon it could possibly need. Five species of Pacific salmon return to Alaskan rivers every year, generating several hundred million pounds of fish flesh every year. Where does it all go? The United States imports seafood in increasing numbers, even for salmon, which it has in abundance.Again, abroad. Increasingly to Asia. Alaska, by far our biggest fish-producing state, exports around three-quarters of its salmon. To make things triply strange, a portion of that salmon, after heading across the Pacific, returns to us: Because foreign labor is so cheap, many Alaskan salmon are caught in American waters, frozen, defrosted in Asia, filleted and boned, refrozen and sent back to us. Pollock also make this Asian round trip, as do squid \u2014 and who knows what else? When you dig into the fish-trade data, things get murkier. In its 2012 summary of the international fish trade, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted, somewhat bizarrely, that its definition of exports \u201cmay include merchandise of both domestic and foreign origin.\u201d So, for example, when fish sticks are cut from blocks of imported \u201cwhite fish\u201d in an American facility and exported to a foreign country, they are classified as American domestic production. Meanwhile some of our imports, as with an unknowable portion of our salmon, are taken from American waters, reprocessed elsewhere and brought back home. Do these percentages cancel themselves out? We don\u2019t know.And that\u2019s my point. Globalization, that unseen force that supposedly eliminates inefficiencies through the magic of trade, has radically disconnected us from our seafood supply. Of course, there is a place for the farming of shrimp, just as there is a place for the farming of oysters. There is a need for efficient aquacultured species like tilapia and Pangasius, just as there is a need to curb the overfishing of Atlantic cod. There is even a place for farmed Atlantic salmon, particularly if it can be raised so it doesn\u2019t affect wild salmon. But when trade so completely severs us from our coastal ecosystems, what motivation have we to preserve them? I\u2019d argue that with so much farmed salmon coming into the country, we turn a blind eye to projects like the proposed Pebble Mine in Alaska, which would process 10 billion tons of ore from a site next to the spawning grounds of the largest wild sockeye salmon run on earth. I\u2019d maintain that farmed shrimp inure us to the fact that the principal rearing ground of Gulf shrimp, the Mississippi River Delta, is slipping into the sea at a rate of a football field an hour. I\u2019d venture that if we didn\u2019t import so much farmed seafood we might develop a viable, sustainable aquaculture sector of our own. Currently the United States languishes in 15th place in aquaculture, behind microscopic economies like Egypt and Myanmar. And I\u2019d suggest that all this fish swapping contributes to an often fraudulent seafood marketplace, where nearly half of the oceanic products sold may be mislabeled. We can have no more intimate relationship with our environment than to eat from it. During the last century that intimacy has been lost, and with it our pathway to one of the most healthful American foods. It is our obligation to reclaim this intimacy. This requires us not just to eat local seafood; it requires the establishment of a working relationship with our marine environment. It means, in short, making seafood not only central to personal health, but critical to the larger health of the nation.Data analysis was provided by Carolyn Hall, a historical marine ecologist.

{"Headline": "Sisi and the Palestinians", "Date": "2014-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRamallah, West Bank \u2014 The Palestinian cause has always had deep ties to Egypt, which has historically been the largest and most powerful Arab state. As such, it has played the most significant and influential role in defining the Arab world\u2019s position on Palestine, both regionally and internationally. When relations between Egypt and Palestinian leaders have been good, like during the era of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt has played a central role and provided support. When relations have deteriorated, as they did under Anwar al-Sadat and again over the past two years, Egypt\u2019s influence has diminished. When Egypt is internally stable, it is externally active, which benefits the Palestinian cause. However, when it becomes preoccupied with its internal affairs and turns inward, then Egypt\u2019s regional and international roles recede, as do its desire and ability to support the Palestinian cause. Since the outbreak of the Egyptian revolution in 2011, Egypt has been consumed by its internal affairs, which has left it incapable of having any real influence on regional or international affairs. The situation has been exacerbated by the increasing influence of non-Arab states like Iran and Turkey, which has led to a decline in the diplomatic power and effectiveness of Arab states. These days, most Arab governments are trying to deal with their own people, and grappling with revolutions and civil wars. The Palestinian cause has fallen by the wayside, and Palestinians have been left to face Israel alone, something they cannot do. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s election as the new Egyptian president has given Palestinians a sliver of hope that their cause will return to the forefront of Arab affairs \u2014 or that, at least, there will be a slight adjustment in the balance of power with Israel. This has nothing to do with any value judgments about the Egyptian revolution. It is a purely pragmatic stance, based on the fact that Mr. Sisi\u2019s election will influence Palestinian affairs in three significant ways. First, this election may mark the return of stability to Egypt, a stability that is important to Palestinians and to future support of the Palestinian cause. Mr. Sisi is not only supported by the army but also by a large swath of the Egyptian population that desires a return to stability, security and normalcy. This won\u2019t happen quickly, but its consequences will accumulate quickly.Any new president of Egypt, in order to prevent protesters from taking to the streets, will need to bring the country out of its current decrepitude, modernize its infrastructure, update its education and stimulate its economy. Second, achieving stability in Egypt is necessary for Egypt to compete with the new regional powers that have usurped its place. If successful, the Egyptian presidential election will have a positive effect on calming the rough waters of Arab politics. Egypt is a strong, central state, and if it begins to stabilize, this will have a positive influence on its Arab neighbors in places like Libya, Syria and Lebanon, and even Iraq. Piecing together the fragments of the current Arab political scene is a crucial step in ending non-Arab actors\u2019 interference in regional affairs. In the near future, Egypt, with the support of the Gulf states, could play a central role in achieving this. Finally, Egypt will not be able to rise to its former regional grandeur, the sort it enjoyed under Nasser, until it liberates itself from its absolute surrender to the United States, which has, since Sadat, transformed it into nothing more than a satellite in America\u2019s political orbit \u2014 so much so that by the end of the Mubarak era, it appeared to be merely following America\u2019s orders. It appears that Mr. Sisi will have different relations with the United States than his predecessors did. While continuing to maintain Egypt\u2019s strong ties to America, there are signs that he plans to steer Egypt toward a more independent foreign policy; his recent trip to Russia is one indication. If all of this happens and Egypt manages to avoid a new cycle of violence, then the situation in Palestine could also start to improve. Palestinians will need to repair the relationship that was frayed during the period in which Hamas was being accused of interfering in internal Egyptian affairs (this led to growing Egyptian mistrust and negative sentiment towards Palestinians in general). This popular mistrust led the Egyptian authorities to take measures against the Gaza Strip, including destroying the hundreds of tunnels that made up Hamas\u2019s central lifeline in Gaza. Egypt\u2019s actions, in addition to other factors like the drying up of political and financial support to Hamas have produced results, the most significant of which may be the internal Palestinian reconciliation that brought an end to the bitter seven-year separation. In short, Hamas learned its lesson. The end of the Palestinian political schism also marks a return to normal with Egypt. The Palestinian Presidential guard is taking over control of the border between Gaza and Egypt, which will lead to more Palestinian control over security and enable Egypt to better deal with security in the Sinai Peninsula. As a result, the Palestinian cause could once regain the strong regional and international ally that it so desperately needs. No one expects Mr. Sisi to renege on the peace treaty with Israel, since that has become important to Egypt\u2019s own national security. However, it is expected that there will be a cold peace with Israel, and that Egypt will take a strong and proactive role in confronting Israeli settlement expansion in Jerusalem and the West Bank. High Palestinian expectations are linked to Egypt\u2019s internal stability. Some will materialize; others are sheer hope. But if Mr. Sisi\u2019s Egypt refuses to shy away from confronting Israel, as Egypt did during the Mubarak era when it was firmly under the American thumb, that will be a great boon for the Palestinian cause.Advertisement"}

That was for math geeks, science nerds, white guys.\u201cI\u2019m an African-American woman,\u201d Ms. Eady said, ticking off the reasons why not. \u201cI love history and art and English. That wasn\u2019t me.\u201dIf I had bumped into Ms. Eady before she walked into that meet-up last summer, you would be reading a different column right now. You would be reading about how Ms. Eady, a recent college graduate, was ensnared in the all-too-familiar underemployment trap. You would be learning about the short-term jobs that barely kept her afloat. You would be hearing about her uncertainty and anxiety about the future.But that is no longer Ms. Eady\u2019s story.Instead, this column is about new directions and unexpected opportunities, about how city officials, in partnership with innovative educators, are trying to transform the lives of ordinary people struggling to find their footing during this weak economic recovery.It is also the story of how Ms. Eady, 25, finally found a stable, well-paying job.At the Flatiron School, which trains people in software coding, Ms. Eady met female programmers and programmers of all shades. She met musicians who were coding, finance guys who were coding. She met creative people who talked about building things \u2014 new apps, new websites, new ways to tell stories.Their work fired her imagination. It reminded her of her time as a production assistant for a documentary film company, when she helped stitch together bits of film and snippets of sound to create something beautiful.\u201cIt just completely blew my mind,\u201d said Ms. Eady, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in media studies with a concentration in film. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have always been excited about math and science to be a programmer.\u201cYou have to think outside the box,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be able to imagine the end product and, piece by piece, put it together. That\u2019s what I loved when I was doing film.\u201dWhen she discovered that the city was offering fellowships for people interested in learning coding at Flatiron, she jumped at the chance.\u201cWe targeted people with diverse backgrounds,\u201d said Adam Enbar, the co-founder and chief executive of the Flatiron School. \u201cThe truth is that it\u2019s a lot more creative than anything else, and anyone can learn.\u201d\u201cIt was hard as hell,\u201d Ms. Eady said.During the five-and-a-half-month course, she learned Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, database building and web design. By the time they graduated in March, she and some of her classmates had helped the owner of a computer repair shop build a web application for his business.It won\u2019t be easy. A sizable portion of the fellows in Ms. Eady\u2019s program already had worked on digital projects or had taught themselves some programming skills.But Ms. Eady, the artsy humanities graduate who had never worked with computers, is a testament to what is possible.Last month, she started work as a junior applications developer at Fox News. For the first time in her life, she has a full-time job with health insurance and a 401(k).\u201cI\u2019m using my brain,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m growing every day.

{"Headline": "Report Finds Higher Risks if Oil Line Is Not Built", "Date": "2014-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 If the Keystone XL pipeline is not built \u2014 and more oil from the Canadian oil sands is moved by rail \u2014 there could be hundreds more deaths and thousands more injuries than expected over the course of a decade, according to an updated State Department analysis of the contested project that was released Friday. The report is the latest twist in the long fight over the proposed 1,700-mile pipeline, which would carry crude oil from Alberta to Gulf Coast refineries. The findings are significant: The State Department has the authority to approve the pipeline because it would cross international borders, although President Obama is expected to make the ultimate call.The initial study noted that without the pipeline, companies would simply move the oil by rail, and an addendum concluded that the alternative could contribute to 700 injuries and 92 deaths over 10 years. Friday\u2019s updated report raised those numbers more than fourfold, concluding that rail transport could lead to 2,947 injuries and 434 deaths over a decade.The State Department said the initial report was based on an erroneous database search. Both supporters and opponents of the pipeline project seized on Friday\u2019s news. Keystone proponents said that the risk of more deaths strengthens the case in favor of the project. Environmental groups said that the report highlighted the danger inherent in developing the oil sands at all. State Department officials said the updated information was not likely to influence any decision. Secretary of State John Kerry has sought opinions from several cabinet officials in his deliberations, and State Department officials say he will consider the pipeline\u2019s impact on the environment, economy and national security, among other issues, before making a recommendation to Mr. Obama. \u201cToday\u2019s correction by State Department further highlights the extreme dangers to people and wildlife posed by climate-disrupting tar sands oil,\u201d he said. \u201cDoubt over Keystone XL has already likely caused the cancellation of major new tar sands projects, which means less tar sands coming out of the ground. It is only by keeping tar sands in the ground and quickly moving to clean, responsible sources of energy that we can avoid severe harm to America\u2019s public health, wildlife habitat and communities.\u201dIt is unlikely that the administration will reach a decision about the project until after the November election. In April, the State Department said it would delay its calls until it has a clearer idea of how legal challenges to the pipeline\u2019s route would be settled. Those issues are not expected to be resolved before the end of this year. The pipeline is shaping up as a major issue this fall \u2014 as it was in the 2012 presidential election \u2014 with supporters saying it is important to economic growth and opponents calling on Mr. Obama to reject the project as a symbol of his commitment to fighting climate change.

{"Headline": "Politics Replaces Economics as Europe's Nemesis", "Date": "2014-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropePARIS \u2014 With the euro zone bond market back to irrational exuberance and economic growth returning slowly if unevenly, politics rather than economics now poses the biggest threat to the long-term endurance of the euro.Widespread anti-European-Union protest votes in elections for the European Parliament last month will make it harder for many governments to pursue deficit-cutting and structural economic changes or to deepen the integration of the 18 European Union countries that use the euro.Public resistance in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, could hamstring the European Central Bank\u2019s ability to tackle dangerously low levels of inflation. The central bank has announced measures to stimulate economic growth by pushing banks to increase lending, but German fear of inflation may prevent the E.C.B. from doing what may be needed to prevent a downward price spiral: buying assets on a large scale like governments in the United States and Britain did.At the same time, Berlin is balking at using its own healthy finances to invest more in infrastructure or spur domestic demand with tax cuts that could help soften the blow of Europe\u2019s economic adjustment.European Union leaders and the E.C.B. have done enough to restore market confidence for now by equipping the euro zone with a financial rescue fund, stricter fiscal discipline, a single banking supervisor and a de facto lender of last resort.But the political will to complete economic and monetary union is weakening, especially if reforms require winning public approval for changes to the Union\u2019s governing treaties.In a book published before the elections, the French economist Jean Pisani-Ferry argued that Europe\u2019s leaders were reluctant to give any more power to Brussels and wanted to avoid controversy over further European integration. \u201cFighting the euro crisis has already proved divisive domestically,\u201d he said. \u201cThe less they take initiatives, the less they risk political problems at home.\u201d The surge in support for euro-skeptic and anti-establishment parties in the European parliamentary election on May 25 only reinforced that inertia. Even critics who predicted the euro zone could break up, like the American economist Nouriel Roubini, acknowledge that much has improved in the past two years. \u201cCertainly many things in the euro zone are moving in the right direction,\u201d he told a conference of the Maurice Allais Foundation in Paris, citing more sustainable fiscal policies; changes in the labor market, pension systems and welfare; and improved competitiveness in several countries.Countries that received bailouts have regained full access to market funding, except Greece and Cyprus, and even Athens has returned to the capital markets with a five-year bond. As investors pile back into Europe, yields on Spanish 10-year government bonds are now roughly equal to those of the United States and Britain, three years after Madrid needed a 43-billion-euro, or $58.7 billion, bailout by the European Union to restructure its shattered banks.Four of the countries that received financial aid \u2014 Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain \u2014 were among the top five countries to improve their competitiveness in the latest \u201cGoing for Growth\u201d report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the association of free-market democracies.All have substantially reduced unit labor costs, eliminated big current account deficits, shrunk the public sector payroll and made progress toward balancing their budgets.The giant black spot is unemployment, which remains above 25 percent in Spain and Greece and touches more than half of all young people.All are also emerging from the crisis with much heavier debt burdens, although the weight of debt service is lightened by the long delays before they have to repay loans to Europe\u2019s rescue fund, deadlines that are likely to be extended still further for Greece.But optimistic European officials say the euro zone periphery will be its most dynamic region in the coming years, comparing it to the success of bitter International Monetary Fund medicine in Indonesia and South Korea during the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s.Many economists doubt that, however. Mr. Pisani-Ferry, now head of the French government\u2019s policy planning unit, says the deindustrialization of Southern Europe may be irreversible.The focus of concern is now shifting to France and Italy, the euro zone\u2019s second- and third-largest economies, which did not require bailouts and have implemented fewer reforms.The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, bucked the trend in the European vote, winning a strong mandate to pursue changes in the political system and labor markets. But given Rome\u2019s endemic political instability, the enduring blocking power of vested interests and the weakness of its legal system, he still faces daunting obstacles.The biggest challenge may be France, where the European election victory of Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front has weakened President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialist government just as it is finally set to ease the tax and regulatory burden on business.Mr. Hollande\u2019s 81 percent disapproval rating and back-to-back defeats in municipal and European elections may drain him of the authority to implement the changes necessary to revive investment and job creation in France.Electoral gains for hard-left anti-austerity parties in Greece and to a lesser extent Spain have raised pressure for governments to lighten spending cuts and end unpopular economic reforms. \u201cThe social and political backlash against austerity and reform could become overwhelming,\u201d Mr. Roubini warned.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Polish Premier Says Scandal May Prompt Early Vote", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland warned Thursday that he might be forced to call early elections if a scandal over secretly taped conversations of senior government officials continued to escalate.\u201cIf the crisis of confidence becomes too deep, perhaps the only way out will be early elections,\u201d he said in a hastily organized news conference on the morning of a major national holiday, the Catholic feast of Corpus Christi, when government offices are normally dormant.The news conference came after a tense scene on Wednesday in the offices of Wprost, the weekly newspaper that published transcripts of the conversations last weekend. Polish security officers raided the newspaper\u2019s offices and demanded the personal laptop of the top editor, Sylwester Latkowski, saying it might contain the evidence they need in their investigation of who made the illegal recordings.The editor refused, called on other Polish journalists for support, and after a standoff that lasted for hours, the security agents left without the laptop.Mr. Tusk criticized the raid and said it had been conducted without his knowledge. He also indicated that he might reconsider whether to dismiss his interior minister, Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, who was recorded on at least one of the tapes and who is in charge of the investigation.The recordings had been made over the last year or so in the private back room of a Warsaw restaurant popular with the political elite. It remains unclear who made the tapes or how they came into the possession of Wprost.Initially, after the recordings were published, Mr. Tusk said he would not demand Mr. Sienkiewicz\u2019s resignation since he had found no evidence of illegal activity in the transcripts.In one of the tapes, recorded in July 2013, the interior minister is heard talking with the head of Poland\u2019s central bank about whether the bank might step in to shore up the economy in advance of the next elections in 2015, should there be an economic downturn. The central bank is supposed to remain independent of partisan politics under Polish law.The prime minister called on the weekly newspaper to release all of the tapes in its possession. The newspaper has said it will publish another transcript in its next issue, due on Warsaw newsstands on Monday.Mr. Tusk did not say how long he would take to make his decision about early elections, or exactly how long it would be before they would be held.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Puts Drag on Euro Zone Growth, Report Shows", "Date": "2014-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The euro zone economy expanded in June for a 12th straight month, a private sector report indicated on Monday, but the pace of growth slowed and there were signs that the French economy may again be shrinking.A number above 50 indicates expansion, while a number below that level suggests contraction. Economists see the surveys as providing one of the most timely indicators of the state of the euro zone economy.The data showed a glaring discrepancy between most of the currency bloc and France, where a broad-based slowdown appears to be underway, Markit said. Businesses are shedding more workers at a time of already high unemployment.And German growth, while still strong by euro zone standards, appears to have slowed a bit.Markit said that outside those two countries, growth was the strongest since August 2007.\u201cIf you take out France, the rest of the euro zone is showing improvement,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING Group in Brussels. \u201cFrance\u2019s weakness has been evident for a while. It\u2019s not in a deep recession, but there\u2019s a severe stagnation.\u201dMr. Brzeski said the latest data were consistent with second-quarter growth of about 1.2 percent on an annualized basis, up from the disappointing 0.7 percent annualized growth according to official figures in the first three months of 2014.Emergency measures announced this month by the European Central Bank have only underlined the fragile state of the economy.\u201cThe economy isn\u2019t at the brink of disaster,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said, \u201cbut it\u2019s still not strong enough to make it without the tailwinds provided by the E.C.B. Hopefully that will set in in the second half of the year.\u201d\u201cFrench stagnation looks to continue, without the least sign of letting up in the short term,\u201d \u200bBruno Cavalier, an economist with Oddo Securities, wrote in a research note.Mr. Cavalier said confidence in France was not improving, which was \u201call the more worrisome\u201d because a new prime minister, Manuel Valls, was appointed at the end of March with a mandate to make economic policy more favorable to business.On one hand, Mr. Cavalier said, crises on both the left and right of French politics have contributed to a great deal of uncertainty about the outlook for policy. On the other, high unemployment and deteriorating household finances are weighing on consumer spending.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that the economy won\u2019t grow at all in the second quarter,\u201d he said, invalidating the official forecast for 1 percent growth this year and putting its deficit reduction plans at risk.There was one positive sign for global growth on Monday. A separate survey by Markit and HSBC, focusing on China\u2019s manufacturing sector, suggested that growth in China was rebounding after months of weakening. That index rose to 50.8 in June, from 49.4 a month ago.Mr. Brzeski said he saw no immediate solution to Europe\u2019s fundamental problem: insufficient demand. Governments appear \u201cto be loosening the austerity screws a bit,\u201d he said, possibly providing a small stimulus.But consumers remain weighed down by debt and fearful of spending because of the precarious job market.Consumption \u201cwill pick up a little as the labor market starts to slowly improve,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said, \u201cbut unemployment rates are simply too high for consumption to bounce back substantially.\u201dThe best hopes, he said, are in government spending, exports and possibly investment, as well as \u201ca huge portion of keeping your fingers crossed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumer Spending Fell Well Short of Expectations in May", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American consumers increased their spending only modestly in May, a disappointment to economists who said the weaker-than-expected gain would most likely mean a lesser economic rebound in the April-June quarter than many had envisioned.Spending rose just 0.2 percent last month after no gain in April, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. The two months followed a robust spending surge of 0.8 percent in March.Income rose a solid 0.4 percent in May after a 0.3 percent increase in April.Last month\u2019s 0.2 percent gain in spending was just half the increase that analysts had been expecting.Some said that unless June brought a big increase, spending may not provide as much support to the economy in the second half of the year as they had been forecasting.Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, said consumer spending might end up rising at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the April-June quarter, which he said \u201cwouldn\u2019t be much of a rebound\u201d from the sluggish 1 percent growth in consumer spending last quarter.Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity.Mr. Dales said strength in other areas should still lift economic growth to around a 3 percent annual rate in the current quarter after a dismal 2.9 percent annual decline in economic output in the first three months of the year.Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, agreed that the spending figure was pointing to economic growth of around 3 percent in the second quarter, instead of the 3.8 percent she had forecast.Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits declined last week. It was the latest evidence that a sharp economic slowdown earlier this year had not caused employers to cut jobs. Weekly unemployment benefit applications fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 312,000.In May, spending on durable goods jumped 0.7 percent, a rebound after having fallen 0.9 percent in April. Also last month, auto dealers reported their best monthly sales in nine years, helped by brisk demand for S.U.V.s and pickup trucks.Sales of nondurable goods rose 0.2 percent in May after a stronger 0.4 percent April gain, while spending on services like rent and utilities increased a modest 0.1 percent.An inflation gauge that is closely monitored by the Federal Reserve has risen 1.8 percent over the last 12 months through May, the fastest rise since late 2012 but still below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target.The Fed at its meeting last week expressed no concerns about the slight uptick in inflation. It was a signal to financial markets that the Fed is comfortable keeping interest rates at low levels for now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Booksellers Score Some Points in Amazon\u2019s Spat With Hachette", "Date": "2014-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseRobert Sindelar, the bearded, redheaded managing partner at the Seattle independent bookseller Third Place Books \u2014 definitely a David to Amazon\u2019s Goliath \u2014 got the idea to take on Amazon while attending BookExpo America in New York a few weeks ago.\u201cAs you can imagine, all anyone was talking about was the standoff between Hachette and Amazon,\u201d he told me this week, referring to the much-publicized impasse in contentious negotiations between the publisher and the giant Internet bookseller. \u201cI wanted to do something positive that would take advantage of this.\u201dExactly what the dispute involves has been shrouded in secrecy, but price is clearly at the center. Hachette and Amazon seem to be locked in the kind of intense negotiations that are common between manufacturers and retailers in most businesses, but have attracted enormous attention because of the visibility and cultural significance of books. (Negotiations between television program suppliers and cable companies have achieved similar notoriety and have also resulted in impasses.)I spoke to someone involved on the Hachette side of the negotiations, who is under orders not to discuss them and asked not to be named. This person said that Amazon has been demanding payments for a range of services, including the pre-order button, personalized recommendations and a dedicated employee at Amazon for Hachette books. This is similar to so-called co-op arrangements with traditional retailers, like paying Barnes & Noble for placing a book in the front of the store.Amazon \u201cis very inventive about what we\u2019d call standard service,\u201d this person said. \u201cThey\u2019re teasing out all these layers and saying, \u2018If you want that service, you\u2019ll have to pay for it.\u2019 In the end, it\u2019s very hard to know what you\u2019d be paying. Hachette has refused, and so bit by bit, they\u2019ve been taking away these services, like the pre-order button, to teach Hachette a lesson.\u201dWhat bothered Mr. Sindelar wasn\u2019t that Amazon\u2019s tactics were so hard-boiled. Rather, \u201cour goal as retailers is to connect people to books,\u201d he said. \u201cThe notion that a retailer would obstruct readers from getting to certain books they want completely violates our ethics as retailers. I wondered how we could get that message across to customers.\u201dThird Place Books began featuring \u201cThe Silkworm\u201d prominently on the home page of its website, offering hardcover copies at a 20 percent discount along with free, in-person delivery the day the book was released, which was Thursday. Mr. Sindelar, along with several other store employees, delivered the books (although a surprising number of customers said not to bother \u2014 they wanted to come into the store for their copy). He also handed out what he called \u201cHachette swag bags\u201d with a T-shirt and advance copy of a coming Hachette novel. Some buyers also received a surprise visit from a local author, Maria Semple, who wrote the best-selling book \u201cWhere\u2019d You Go, Bernadette.\u201d\u201cI thought this would show what we as booksellers stand for,\u201d Mr. Sindelar said. \u201cWhile Amazon is blocking people, we literally put the book in their hands. But we\u2019re not asking people to boycott Amazon. We\u2019re in Seattle and Amazon is a big part of the local economy. We\u2019re sensitive to that.\u201dMr. Sindelar\u2019s efforts to gain at the expense of a major rival like Amazon could also be described in another healthy, positive way: competition. Amazon\u2019s decision to take a hard line with Hachette seems to have provided a sudden competitive advantage for other booksellers, large and small.On Walmart.com on Thursday, \u201cThe Silkworm\u201d was one of three books featured on the books\u2019 home page at 40 percent off, or $16.80. Walmart has also promoted the book with ads on Facebook and through mass emails to its customers promoting Hachette books. On Barnes & Noble\u2019s site, \u201cThe Silkworm\u201d was one of four of \u201cthe week\u2019s biggest books.\u201d A digital edition for the Nook was $11.99. It was Barnes & Noble\u2019s No. 2 best-seller on Thursday. On Bookish, the website that the major publishers started last year to combat Amazon, it was the first \u201cnew and notable\u201d release featured, and was selling for $19.60.Amazon showed no sign of backing down. On Thursday, it was selling \u201cThe Silkworm\u201d in hardback for $25.20 \u2014 nearly the full suggested retail price \u2014 along with the message that delivery could take \u201c2 to 4 weeks.\u201d On Thursday afternoon, the book\u2019s best-seller rank was just 210. (The Kindle digital edition was $9.99.)From Mr. Sindelar\u2019s perspective, his promotion was successful. He said he sold 60 copies on the first day, when ordinarily, he said, he\u2019d be lucky to sell five.All of this must be warming the hearts of antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which was widely criticized after it filed an antitrust case against five major publishers and Apple, accusing them of conspiring to raise e-book prices. The five publishers \u2014 Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster (all the so-called majors except Random House) \u2014 settled the charges with the department and agreed not to collude. Apple was found guilty after a lengthy trial. (It is appealing the decision.) A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the Amazon-Hachette dispute.To many, especially publishers, authors and booksellers, it seemed perverse that the government sued the major publishers and Apple, whose iBookstore was a new entrant into digital publishing, and not Amazon itself, which seemed to be rapidly amassing quasi-monopoly power in book retailing. But as Judge Denise Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled, the evidence was overwhelming that the publishers\u2019 and Apple\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t to promote competition, but to raise e-book prices so that Apple wouldn\u2019t lose money and so that e-book sales wouldn\u2019t undercut the far more profitable sales of hardcover books.Still, even Amazon seems willing to make some concessions. Two Hachette books, J. D. Salinger\u2019s \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d and \u201cThe Goldfinch,\u201d by Donna Tartt, are available on Amazon at deep discounts and for immediate delivery. Why that would be the case isn\u2019t clear, but one is a classic used in many schools and the other recently won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.Hachette declined to comment on negotiations with Amazon. As for \u201cThe Silkworm,\u201d a spokeswoman for Little, Brown said it was too soon to have any sales numbers, but \u201cthe early feedback we\u2019ve had from retailers is very encouraging.\u201dAnd while Hachette is the lone publisher operating in the United States in the current standoff, other contracts between Amazon and major publishers will soon be expiring. The other publishers and booksellers are eager to see if they, too, hold the line. (There\u2019s nothing illegal about publishers adopting similar stances in their negotiations, as long as they don\u2019t collude.)Whether even the combined efforts of the publishers and competitive efforts of rival retailers can dent Amazon\u2019s market power remains to be seen. Amazon accounts for about a third of book sales in the United States and 60 percent of Hachette\u2019s digital sales. The person involved in the Hachette negotiations wasn\u2019t optimistic for the publishers. In previous rounds with Amazon, \u201cWe had so little leverage. It felt like I had a slingshot and they had a tank. We\u2019d fight and fight and then we\u2019d make concessions. They rolled over us.\u201dThis person compared Hachette\u2019s situation to that of gazelles, a reference to Brad Stone\u2019s book about Amazon, \u201cThe Everything Store.\u201d In it, Mr. Stone describes what was known inside the company as \u201cThe Gazelle Project,\u201d in which the chief executive, Jeffrey Bezos, compared Amazon to a cheetah hunting weak, sickly gazelles \u2014 in that case, a metaphor for small publishers.\u201cWho\u2019s going to blink first?\u201d mused Mr. Sindelar, the independent bookseller. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone wants to know. I have no idea. But a lot of our customers told us they were buying from us explicitly as a protest against Amazon. We live in Seattle, where people go to farmers\u2019 markets. They don\u2019t want to limit the diversity of where they shop. I think this has helped people realize that if Amazon is the only option, that\u2019s putting way too much power in one company.\u201dAdvertisement"}

First, the consequences will be terrible if we don\u2019t take quick action to limit carbon emissions. Second, in pure economic terms the required action shouldn\u2019t be hard to take: emission controls, done right, would probably slow economic growth, but not by much. Third, the politics of action are nonetheless very difficult.But why is it so hard to act? Is it the power of vested interests?I\u2019ve been looking into that issue and have come to the somewhat surprising conclusion that it\u2019s not mainly about the vested interests. They do, of course, exist and play an important role; funding from fossil-fuel interests has played a crucial role in sustaining the illusion that climate science is less settled than it is. But the monetary stakes aren\u2019t nearly as big as you might think. What makes rational action on climate so hard is something else \u2014 a toxic mix of ideology and anti-intellectualism.Before I get to that, however, an aside on the economics. But wouldn\u2019t protecting the environment nonetheless impose costs on some sectors and regions? Yes, it would \u2014 but not as much as you think.Consider, in particular, the much-hyped \u201cwar on coal.\u201d It\u2019s true that getting serious about global warming means, above all, cutting back on (and eventually eliminating) coal-fired power, which would hurt regions of the country that depend on coal-mining jobs. What\u2019s rarely pointed out is how few such jobs still exist. Or put it this way: The real war on coal, or at least on coal workers, took place a generation ago, waged not by liberal environmentalists but by the coal industry itself. And coal workers lost.The owners of coal mines and coal-fired power plants do have a financial interest in blocking environmental policy, but even there the special interests don\u2019t look all that big. So why is the opposition to climate policy so intense? Well, think about global warming from the point of view of someone who grew up taking Ayn Rand seriously, believing that the untrammeled pursuit of self-interest is always good and that government is always the problem, never the solution. Along come some scientists declaring that unrestricted pursuit of self-interest will destroy the world, and that government intervention is the only answer. It doesn\u2019t matter how market-friendly you make the proposed intervention; this is a direct challenge to the libertarian worldview.And the natural reaction is denial \u2014 angry denial. Read or watch any extended debate over climate policy and you\u2019ll be struck by the venom, the sheer rage, of the denialists.The fact that climate concerns rest on scientific consensus makes things even worse, because it plays into the anti-intellectualism that has always been a powerful force in American life, mainly on the right. It\u2019s not really surprising that so many right-wing politicians and pundits quickly turned to conspiracy theories, to accusations that thousands of researchers around the world were colluding in a gigantic hoax whose real purpose was to justify a big-government power grab. After all, right-wingers never liked or trusted scientists in the first place.So the real obstacle, as we try to confront global warming, is economic ideology reinforced by hostility to science. In some ways this makes the task easier: we do not, in fact, have to force people to accept large monetary losses. But we do have to overcome pride and willful ignorance, which is hard indeed.

{"Headline": "Democrats\u2019 Strategy to Keep the Senate", "Date": "2014-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States Congress is widely criticized as being dysfunctional, yet there are interesting, thoughtful members \u2014 Republicans and Democrats.In the top tier is Colorado\u2019s Democratic junior senator, Michael Bennet. He is an expectations-buster. With no background in the field, he became a successful financial executive. He won high praise as the head of the Denver school system, even though he had little experience in education, and after being appointed to fill a vacant seat in the United States Senate in 2009, he won election in 2010, a dreadful year for most Democrats.Mr. Bennet, 49, will be on short lists for vice president in 2016, especially if his strategy as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee thwarts Republican plans to take control of the chamber this November.Mr. Bennet thinks a lot about ideas such as innovation and competing in the global marketplace. He worries that the United States will risk its competitive advantage if the government remains paralyzed over immigration reform, infrastructure investments and creating a more efficient tax code.Generally a progressive Democrat, he often circumvents the partisan divide. This year, however, his main focus has been to keep the Senate in Democratic hands; a Republican takeover would be a nightmare for President Obama.Along with his savvy campaign executive director, Guy Cecil, he is recalibrating traditional strategy to stave off this challenge. The focus is less on big television advertising and more on old-fashioned voter mobilization with cutting-edge new technologies.\u201cIt\u2019s precinct politics with 21st-century technology,\u201d Mr. Bennet said.In part this is driven by necessity. \u201cWe can\u2019t compete dollar for dollar with the outside conservative groups\u201d that are spending hundreds of millions in the most competitive Senate races, he said.Moreover, with all of this spending, there is clutter on the airwaves, diluting any message. And in today\u2019s polarized politics, persuasion through ads is less effective.Losing campaigns \u2014 think Barry Goldwater or George McGovern \u2014 have long deluded themselves that their special appeal would enlarge the voting universe. That isn\u2019t the Bennet and Cecil theory. They note that the drop-off in voters for presidential elections disproportionately involves Democrats: younger people, lower incomes and minorities. The means to identify, take aim at and reach more passive voters have become much more sophisticated, starting with Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential runs and the increasing use of social media.Nothing will stem a national tide. But short of that, Sasha Issenberg, who has written extensively on the new techniques of mobilization, argues that the Democrats have the capacity, if they have the resources, to increase marginal turnout to affect a number of close contests.The central components of success are raising enough money and then recruiting a sizable volunteer force \u2014 volunteers are more effective than paid canvassers \u2014 to work their own neighborhoods and precincts to register voters and get them to vote.They have databases to identify prospects with all of their demographic essentials and possess the techniques to contact and influence them.Thus, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and affiliates plan to spend about $60 million on these mobilization efforts, or about one-third of the budget, almost 10 times what the D.S.C.C. spent in 2010.Republicans dismiss this as pie in the sky, arguing that Mr. Obama\u2019s sinking approval ratings, along with dissatisfaction with the economy and the health care law, will depress Democratic turnout and bring more Republicans to the polls this fall.Mr. Bennet, who unlike most other Democrats in 2010 relied heavily on field operations in his Senate race, acknowledges this isn\u2019t an easy environment but suggested that the climate and candidates are better than they were four years ago.\u201cIf I could survive in 2010, the notion that with the candidates we have this year we can\u2019t win is just wrong,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Expanding Nonbank Finance in the E.U.", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe European Union needs more nonbank finance. Banks are still wobbly and so will not be able to fund the jobs and growth the European Union is desperate for on their own. Nonbank finance needs to take up the slack.The European Central Bank and Bank of England have made a good start by identifying what is needed to revive the \u201csecuritization\u201d market. Securitization is the process of packaging loans into bondlike securities, which can then be traded on the market. The two central banks have just published a joint paper on blockages in the system that have virtually killed securitization in the European Union since the financial crisis.But securitization is only one piece of the nonbank finance landscape. Similar projects are needed for venture capital, shadow banking, shares, mini-bonds and so forth.Following the financial crisis, securitization \u2014 and \u201cmarket-based finance\u201d in general \u2014 has had a bad name. This is only partly deserved.Securitization was certainly partly to blame for the subprime crisis in the United States that set off the global credit crunch. Banks did not just originate mortgage loans and sell them off to third-party investors \u2014 something sometimes described as \u201cplain vanilla\u201d securitization. They engaged in increasingly exotic and wild practices.Not only did the banks lend to borrowers who were unable to service their loans. They constructed opaque financial instruments, sometimes securitizations of securitizations, in order to jack up the promised returns.What is more, the institutions that bought the securities often were not suitable long-term investors. Sometimes, they were highly leveraged short-term investors who were only able to buy these instruments because the banks that were selling them the paper were effectively acting as lenders of last resort. Sometimes, the banks hung on to the securities themselves.As a result, when the subprime market exploded, the banking industry was dragged down, too. Securitization was supposed to diversify risk away from banks. It did nothing of the sort.Why, then, one might ask, are the E.C.B. and Bank of England keen to revive these weapons of mass financial suicide? Partly because the European Union\u2019s securitization market had been declared guilty by association with the American market, whereas in fact it was innocent.Default rates on consumer securitizations in the European Union from 2007 to 2013 were only 0.05 percent, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s; the equivalent for the United States was 18.4 percent. It is ironic, given this comparative record, that the American market has rebounded while the European Union one is virtually dead.But the main reason to breathe life into the market is because of what is happening to banks in the European Union, particularly those in the euro zone. As a consequence of the credit crisis and the subsequent euro crisis, banks are rightly being more tightly regulated. They are also shrinking. If finance doesn\u2019t come from some other source, Europe could be condemned to years of slow growth.Securitization is a good alternative source of funding, provided it develops in a controlled way. It allows banks to keep making new loans while still shrinking their balance sheets. It can also transfer credit risk to lowly leveraged investors who do not have to be propped up by the taxpayer if there is another downturn.The E.C.B. and Bank of England have come up with a series of proposals for letting this market develop in a healthy way. Most of what they advocate involves unblocking arcane parts of the financial system\u2019s plumbing. But the big proposal is to distinguish between plain vanilla and exotic securitization, and then regulate the former less harshly.While this is an excellent initiative, it should be seen as only part of the solution to Europe\u2019s \u201cbankcentricity\u201d \u2014 the fact that it is far more dependent on banks to provide finance than the United States is. A broad-based approach is needed to develop healthy nonbank finance.Other debt securities are certainly part of the picture. Large companies have little trouble issuing bonds in the European Union. But that is not so for smaller companies. Europe would benefit from a bigger junk bond market, as well as mini-bonds (where smaller companies tap the market) and private placements (where bonds are placed with investors outside a formal market).There is also scope to expand lending by nonbanks. The two most promising are peer-to-peer lending, where Internet sites match borrowers with lenders; and shadow banking, a broad term for nonbank lending that has become something of a dirty word since the crisis but would be valuable if properly regulated.But nonbank finance doesn\u2019t just mean nonbank debt. Europe doesn\u2019t just suffer from bankcentricity; it also suffers from \u201cdebtcentricity.\u201d The economy would be more resilient if companies relied more on equity.In that vein, European policy makers need to see what they can do to encourage both more issuance of equity on stock markets and more venture capital for start-ups and rapidly growing companies. One policy change could be to remove the bias in the tax system toward issuing debt that stems from the fact that interest payments are tax deductible.The E.C.B. and Bank of England will be important actors in ending the European Union\u2019s bankcentricity. The E.C.B. is the pre-eminent financial regulator for the euro zone, while the Bank of England is the equivalent for the City of London, Europe\u2019s financial center.But politicians also need to get on the stage. Indeed, heads of government should make the project of developing healthy market-based finance a priority for the new European Commission, which takes office next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unplugging in the Unofficial Capital of Yoga", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPursuitsIt was a hot and dusty afternoon, about 30 hours into my Indian journey, when the bus driver dropped me off in a small town that he said was near my destination: Rishikesh, regarded as the unofficial world capital of yoga. Only a short rickshaw ride, it seemed, separated my fatigued self from inner Zen. Nearly two weeks of life with monks at an ashram awaited.On what I hoped was my final jaunt, the rickshaw ride took me through a labyrinth of cows, street vendors and bicycles set against a stunning Himalayan mountainscape. The sun was bright, but the tedium and duration of the trip had left me feeling like the cow dung I had stepped in along the way.From New Delhi, Rishikesh is accessible by train, plane and bus. Without much planning, I had boarded a bus from New Delhi for about $8 on the fly and embarked on an eight-hour, bump-filled journey, complete with \u201cElephant Crossing\u201d signs along the way.It is a \u201cland in which to conquer one\u2019s senses,\u201d a guidebook for Parmarth reads, \u201cto conquer the call of desire, to become a master of oneself.\u201dThat sounded good to me, even if it felt a bit on the self-indulgent side for a getaway. Before my departure, a yoga-teacher friend labeled Rishikesh \u201cyoga heaven.\u201d An Indian friend countered, \u201cThat\u2019s where the annoying kids from my boarding school hung out.\u201dCurious and without shame, I joined their ranks: Was Rishikesh a morally bankrupt yoga Disneyland or still a special spiritual destination?Yoga had entered my life in earnest a few years ago when I was looking for a way to stretch and prevent injuries from running. I became a regular, attending a yoga class at my local gym or studio in New York two to three times a week, but I am by no means a certified teacher or expert on its origins. But if I had to be really honest about why I first got into it, it was because I enjoyed the quiet time and didn\u2019t want to become fat and brittle.I was already in love with what Rishikesh didn\u2019t have. No Starbucks, no McDonald\u2019s, no condos along the Ganges. And also what I didn\u2019t have: I had decided to turn off my iPhone during my 10-day stay. No web browsing, no apps, no emails, no voice-mail messages, no text messages. While Rishikesh doesn\u2019t lack digital connections, I, like many New Yorkers, felt too plugged in, my iPhone at times feeling hooked to my person like a respirator. That all-too-common feeling was exacerbated by having spent the previous month reporting nonstop at the Winter Games in Sochi, which, in spite of its infamous logistical hurdles (yes, I was one of those who got locked in her hotel room and had to be busted out by a colleague), was a round-the-clock, wired experience.He rolled into the ashram\u2019s prayer hall one morning with a mobile phone tucked into a golden bucket, toothpick-thin legs emerging from a nest of orange cloth; then, in broken English, he guided a small class through a series of heavy, nasal-breathing exercises. His signature move was holding his hands out as claws and leading the class in a chorus of loud roars. I felt ridiculous in my yoga pants imitating a lion, but if he was really 105, whatever Yogananda Ji was doing was clearly working. So, I roared.I was fully aware that I had become yet another Westerner making a spiritual voyage to India, a tradition even older than Yogananda Ji, one that is at times complicated, littered with over-romanticization and, occasionally, tension.But as I continued my big cat growls, I was struck by how far the chasm was between what I had experienced in some North American forms of the practice, in which throngs of neurotic yet limber women wear $100 Lululemon pants while channeling their inner pretzel. Although Google Maps can help locate a vinyasa class in Manhattan by star-rating, it\u2019s not as useful for more existential queries like \u201cfind self.\u201dWhile Rishikesh offers some hotel options, I wanted to stay at an ashram to immerse myself in the yogi life. That\u2019s easier now than ever, as many have websites and will take reservations via phone and email. I had booked a room at Parmarth for 300 to 700 rupees a night, a suggested donation of about $5 to $12, at 60.5 rupees to the dollar.Parmarth is among the ashrams that has delicately danced between extending its arms to make Rishikesh accessible to new, foreign visitors while trying to preserve its Indian, spiritual core. In the last 30 years, it has added Western-style toilets and hot water, but it has drawn the line at television sets, hotel gyms and mini bars.While electricity and heat in the rooms came and went during my stay, it felt luxurious by local standards. I shared the garden pathways with nearly 200 young boys studying Sanskrit and ancient Vedic texts, and an array of \u201cenlightened masters\u201d who came to meet with the swamis. The chanting starts at 5 a.m. every day, and quiet hours are requested after 10 p.m.An American born into a Jewish family in California, she came to Rishikesh as a 25-year-old graduate student on a break in fall 1996 with a guidebook and a whim, excited at the prospect of an easier life as a traveling vegetarian, only to find herself weeping at the banks of the Ganges. \u201cAnd the second part of my life began,\u201d she said.During my stay, I encountered gaggles of yoga teachers, young and old, but also wealthy young Indians unpacking angst, Midwestern American moms also hoping to decompress, one man who had sold his Facebook stock, some befuddled recent college graduates, several recently divorced and miscellaneous heartbroken souls, some self-described \u201ccrusty hippies,\u201d a supermodel yogi, a Catholic priest turned Zen monk, a specialist in \u201claughter yoga,\u201d several people who had recently quit their jobs and at least one teacher who said he preferred to pair his yoga practice with hallucinogenic drugs.\u201cWhat they\u2019re walking away with is much more than just more flexible hamstrings and slightly stronger and more well-defined triceps and some pictures,\u201d Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati said. \u201cPeople, their lives change here.\u201dMornings start at the ashram with prayers and chanting at 5 o\u2019clock, sometimes earlier. Meals are vegetarian, usually rice, lentils and some cooked vegetables, and are eaten in silence while you sit on a floor in a communal space. If alcohol and meat aren\u2019t officially banned in Rishikesh, they\u2019re certainly hard to come by. And many of the spandex uniforms of Manhattan studios clash with ashram dress codes, which ask for women to have shoulders and legs covered.While some local travel agencies offer kayaking and hiking adventures, yoga is by far the main affair, and no one is in a hurry, instead strolling from studio to studio, clad in loose clothing and mats under arm, ready to pop in for a flow.With heavily used muscles comes pain, and Rishikesh offers a bounty of massage options on the cheap, 2,400 rupees, or about $40, for one that involved a hot-oil drip followed by a visit to a steam box that would have been a cannibal\u2019s dream. Expect to get, ahem, more naked than you would for an American massage and handled less gingerly.Ashrams and yoga schools offer an array of seminars in which yoga as a lifestyle and religion are primary topics. Local bookstores offer reasonably priced English-language books about India and its spiritual history, perfect for reading along the Ganges as the aarti, or fire ceremony, takes place every night at sunset. The event engages hundreds for songs and prayer in Hindi and Sanskrit as candles are lit, a symbolic offering of \u201cthank you\u201d to the river that is considered sacred and a source of life and energy.One by one and in front of the large crowd, they asked often-raw questions of Mooji, who answered or used them as springboards for riffs on faith. One question was from a married man with children who said simply, \u201cI\u2019m tired of being a person.\u201d Another was a young woman who was struggling with her conservative Jewish family accepting her as lesbian. At one satsang, a young man made his way onstage and buried himself in Mooji\u2019s lap, in tears. I sat watching cross-legged, feeling somewhere between moved and confused.Three days in, I was doing six to eight hours of yoga a day. When I told yogis and gurus of my tech sabbatical, their reactions reinforced my suspicion that cellphones are something of a Buddhist nightmare, their sole purpose being to take you out of the present. So does worrying. My stress was beginning to dissipate, and as the hours rolled by in meditation and yoga classes, I realized that my mind was less like Steve Jobs\u2019s famously sparse living room than one of the homes from \u201cHoarders.\u201dAs I immersed myself in backbends and kundalini poses that included holding my arms up for 20 minutes at a time (yes, 20 minutes), the half-hour mediation sessions began to feel shorter, the leg poses more attainable. A master of reiki, a Japanese relaxation practice, taught me how she uses a pendulum to read electromagnetic fields and how to sense auras. I learned about the virtues of mudra, or hand gestures, that the teacher said aided in warding off everything from fatigue to back pain to insomnia. Another yogi talked to me at length over ginger tea about quantum physics, which included the lesson that the pain from holding a pose is only a construct because none of us is real. My leg muscles felt otherwise.Not one of the instructors professed the virtues of slate tummies or trimmer thighs. Instead, the visiting Rishikesh yoga teachers, as diverse as their students, seemed more focused on the spiritual rather than the pure fitness side of yoga. None of the studios had mirrors, and much of each class took place with eyes closed.There\u2019s a temptation among Rishikesh-goers to oversimplify India\u2019s mystique. And surely there is something indescribably wonderful about the place, but more than a week into my cellphone furlough, my head mostly cleared of New York and Olympic cacophony, I realized that I, like many of my fellow Americans, am terrible at something the early yogis strove for: balance. Yet Rishikesh itself provided a strange paradox in extremes: while it was a vacation from modernity for those like me, many locals often struggled for the bare necessities, let alone Wi-Fi access. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 takeaway perhaps, but a real one that you can\u2019t just roll a yoga mat over.The idea that I (or anyone) could steal away to Rishikesh and come back Myself 2.0, exuding Beyonc\u00e9-like confidence every moment, is a lovely one. But I knew the greatest test of the Rishikesh trip would be upon my return to an anxiety-filled New York.Having booked several days ahead with a local travel agent for about $12, I boarded the train to New Delhi, which was downright luxurious in contrast to the bus ride. The National Geographic-ready sight of five monks sitting in front of me and laughing over video clips on their iPads reminded me that I was still digitally disconnected, a fact I had almost forgotten. After leaving India, I flicked on my phone and felt an endorphin hit as the hundreds of emails rolled in and I began scrolling.As it turned out, I hadn\u2019t missed much.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dangerous Divisiveness", "Date": "2014-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor an increasing number of Americans, the tenor of politics has reached a near-religious pitch, in which people on opposing ends of the ideological scale take on theological properties: good or evil, angels or demons, here to either save our way of life or destroy it.The report continued:\u201cThe overall share of Americans who express consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades from 10 percent to 21 percent. And ideological thinking is now much more closely aligned with partisanship than in the past. As a result, ideological overlap between the two parties has diminished: Today, 92 percent of Republicans are to the right of the median Democrat, and 94 percent of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican.\u201dThis is not to suggest that there is absolute parity in our polarization. As the report makes clear, while 27 percent of Democrats see the Republican Party as a threat to the nation\u2019s well-being, 36 percent of Republicans see the Democratic Party as a threat. Conservatives were also more likely to say that it was important to live in places where people shared their political views. Additionally, conservatives were more likely to say they would be unhappy if a close relative married a Democrat than were liberals to say they would be unhappy to have a Republican in-law.This phenomenon coincides, to a certain degree, with the rise of talk radio and the stridently ideological cable news \u2014 profit-driven provocateurs whose livelihoods ride on their abilities to rouse rabble, stir passions and diabolize opponents.And many of their listeners, viewers and readers become the apostles of passion, enforcing rigid binary ideologies that accommodate little subtlety. Any seeming equivocation is deemed evidence of apostasy. This, in itself, is dangerous.Our politics are now strung with tripwires of hypersensitivities and micro-aggressions. Every position is assumed to have a sinister subtext, made all the more complicated by the fact that some actually do have such subtexts. The phenomenon, more recently, is epitomized by views about President Obama, which, depending on which silo one is in, either read as blind allegiance or blind hatred. This robs him of the glory of his legitimate achievements and artificially shields his missteps.Still, there are real and legitimate debates to be had about the size and role of government, how to grow and expand the economy, how to help the least fortunate in the short and long term, how to position America militarily in the world as the last remaining superpower, how to protect \u2014 or expand the recognition of \u2014 the right of the individual, especially when those individuals are members of minority groups, while respecting the democratic desires of the majority of our citizens.We must wrestle with these each in its own turn.There are other areas, however \u2014 the continued existence of the detention center at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the use of drones, government surveillance \u2014 that require critical, nonpartisan examination, regardless of who is in charge, in part because many of these policies overlap Republican and Democratic administrations. We must continuously audit our allegiances, not only to keep adversaries at bay, but also to keep allies loyal and true, and to understand that our friends and our rivals aren\u2019t necessarily discrete and oppositional on every issue. Loyalties too freely given and too uncritically maintained become fertile ground for \u2014 and, in fact, issue license for \u2014 the corruption of conscience and the betrayal of principle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Government Pension Funds Became Addicted to Risk", "Date": "2014-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestor OutlookA public pension fund works like this: The government promises to make payments to its employees after they retire; it invests money now and uses those investments, and the returns on them, to make those promised payments later.But as interest rates began their long fall, pension funds faced a dilemma. Staying heavily invested in bonds would force governments either to set aside more cash upfront or to cut pension promises. So instead, pension funds radically changed their investment strategies, embracing investments that produce higher returns but also involve more risk. This shift has replaced an explicit cost with a hidden one: that lawmakers will have to divert more tax dollars into pension funds, cut back on benefits or both when stock market crashes cause pension fund asset values to decline.The shift began with pension funds\u2019 adoption of portfolios consisting mostly of stocks, with only about a quarter of their investments in bonds. Then, in the last few years, they rapidly expanded their use of \u201calternative\u201d asset classes like hedge funds, private equity, commodities and real estate. As of 2012, the typical pension fund investment portfolio was about half stocks, a quarter bonds and cash, and a quarter alternative investments.The shift has allowed public pension funds to adjust to a sharp drop in bond interest rates. Between 1992 and 2012, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell 4.75 percentage points; on average, large government pension funds cut their investment return targets by just 0.7 of a percentage point over that period.And the shift has been, in one sense, a success: Pension funds continue to hit their target returns, on average. After the stock market crash of 2008-9, pension funds\u2019 typical goals of annual returns around 8 percent were often criticized as unrealistic, but the National Association of State Retirement Administrators notes that public pension funds have earned annual returns of 9 percent on average over the last 25 years, despite falling interest rates and gyrating stock prices.The key caveat in that statement is \u201con average.\u201d While the old bond-heavy investment strategy produced steady, stable returns, a pension fund that is full of risky investments will swing heavily, soaring in value when the economy is strong and tanking when it is weak. The recent fashion for investing in managed investment funds, like private equity funds, has also put taxpayers in the position of paying management fees for services of dubious value.But if this were true \u2014 if governments were indifferent, or nearly indifferent, to investment risk \u2014 then they would have an enormous arbitrage opportunity on their hands. They could borrow money on the bond market at low rates and invest it in the stock market for high expected returns, using the proceeds to finance not just pension payouts but all kinds of government operations.The reason governments don\u2019t do this is that they are not actually indifferent to investment volatility. When asset values fall, governments come under pressure (and, in some states, court order) to increase their annual contributions to pension funds to shore them up. Typically, those stock price declines come at the same time that a weak economy is pushing tax receipts down and demand for government services up. A government that does not make those shoring-up contributions can end up in a downward spiral, where the pension fund\u2019s investment projections rely on investments that do not exist, and the pension system\u2019s funding gap continues to grow indefinitely.In the last few years, the need to shore up pension funds has been a key stressor on state and local budgets. In some places this has led lawmakers to cut back on pension benefits, while in others, the benefits are protected by constitutional provisions or the political power of public employees. On the other hand, periods of excellent returns on pension fund stock investments can create political pressure for pension benefit increases, which many jurisdictions handed out as stock prices soared in the late 1990s \u2014 and then came to regret as the tech stock bubble burst.The volatility of stock returns is why pension funds invested in bonds in the first place. And it\u2019s most likely a driver of the recent rush toward alternative investments, which went from 11 percent of pension portfolios in 2006 to 23 percent in 2012, according to Pew; nearly the entire shift has come at the expense of stocks.The theory with alternatives is that they earn a premium return in exchange for the difficulty of investing in them. Small investors lack easy access to these asset classes, and the investments are often illiquid: You can\u2019t call up your broker and sell an office building in 15 minutes to raise cash. As a result, by investing in alternatives, pension funds should be able to get either returns similar to those of equities at a lower risk, or higher returns at a similar level of risk.That\u2019s the theory. The evidence on alternative investments is considerably more mixed. Hedge funds are supposed to pursue equity-like returns with lower levels of risk. But as Antti Ilmanen of the investment manager AQR Capital Management describes in his guide \u201cExpected Returns on Major Asset Classes,\u201d the historical returns of hedge funds are most likely overstated because of reporting biases. Hedge funds don\u2019t have to report their performance to public databases, and are more likely to do so when returns are good.They often engage in strategies that produce modest regular returns at the expense of rare catastrophic losses, which may make their track records look misleadingly strong. And though skilled fund managers can identify opportunities for above-normal returns without increased risk, a rush of investment capital into hedge funds has pushed those average \u201calpha\u201d returns (that is, returns after adjustment for risk) down over time.While Mr. Ilmanen provides a mixed verdict on hedge funds, his verdict on private equity is negative. \u201cThe typical PE manager is skillful enough to outperform public indices on a gross basis, but the benefits of these skills accrue primarily to the manager and not to the investor,\u201d he writes, because management fees exceed the excess gross returns generated by private equity funds.Big management fees are something that private equity and hedge funds have in common, unlike stocks and bonds, which pension systems can generally manage on their own. So it\u2019s no surprise that, as pension funds doubled their allocation to alternatives between 2006 and 2012, their spending on management fees also rose sharply, from 0.28 percent of assets to 0.37 percent, again according to Pew.A rise of 0.09 of a percentage point may not sound like much, but since public pension funds manage approximately $3 trillion in investments, that means an additional $3 billion a year being spent on management fees \u2014 in the case of fees to private equity managers, probably not in exchange for much.Plunging returns on safe investments over the last few years are a sign of broadly increased investment risk and tepid prospects for economic growth. It won\u2019t be impossible for pension funds to meet a return target of 7 to 8 percent in that environment, but doing so will involve taking on a lot of risk \u2014 which means the next stock market crash is likely to also bring another round of exacerbated state fiscal crises and cuts to pension benefits.It\u2019s the way we\u2019re paying for what looks like a free lunch of high investment returns on stocks. A return to boring pension funds that invest mostly in bonds would make the cost of pensions explicit and upfront, and would not subject governments to pension crises when the economy goes bad.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Managers Play Labor Activist Role in China Strikes", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside AsiaSHANGHAI \u2014 Behind China\u2019s biggest strike in decades last month was a new player in Chinese labor activism: management.A previously unpublished account from inside the strike at the Taiwanese shoe manufacturer Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings shows that supervisors were the first to challenge senior plant leaders about the social insurance contributions that became the focus of the dispute. Yue Yuen declined to comment.The involvement of managers underscores the growing complexity and unpredictability of labor relations in China. A generation of long-serving migrant factory employees is starting to retire just as the economy slows and the spread of social media makes strikes easier to organize.The Yue Yuen strike was not the first time in recent years that managers, rather than front-line workers, helped orchestrate industrial action in China. Managers were also involved in leading a strike at IBM\u2019s facility in Shenzhen in March, according to a worker and another person briefed on the strike, who, like others in this article, did not wish to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. IBM declined to comment.Supervisors and other low- and midlevel managers also helped orchestrate workers during a March strike at Shanmukang Technology, which supplies mobile phone cases to Samsung Electronics, a former employee said.Managers have been orchestrating strikes during international deals for years, lawyers said. \u201cIt happens all the time\u201d that managers encourage workers to strike during an international transaction that affects a company\u2019s Chinese operations, said Jonathan M. Isaacs, special counsel with responsibility for Chinese employment and labor issues at the law firm Baker & McKenzie in Hong Kong.In many cases, \u201cthe reason an M.&A. transaction, layoffs or restructuring goes sideways or causes labor unrest is that the local management were disgruntled and riled up the rank-and-file workers,\u201d he added.In November 2011, midlevel managers led thousands of PepsiCo workers to strike against the terms of the company\u2019s acquisition by Tingyi Holdings, according to China Labor Bulletin, a worker advocacy group based in Hong Kong.However, some of the largest recent strikes, including the Yue Yuen action, do not involve a factory sale or restructuring. Labor unrest has surged in China in recent months as slowing economic growth and rising costs have squeezed companies in industrialized areas like the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong Province. China Labor Bulletin has recorded 319 strikes and labor protests since the beginning of the year.Chinese factory disputes typically start with younger employees pushing management for higher pay. But in the past few years, as restructuring has become more common, managers have begun to take a more active role in negotiations and work stoppages because they have more at stake, lawyers said.China\u2019s 2008 labor contract law requires companies that fire employees to pay compensation worth one month\u2019s salary for every year of employment. The longer an employee has been working at a factory, the greater the potential payoff from a closing, merger or restructuring.Turnover at Chinese factories is high, reaching 100 percent a year in some companies. Younger workers spin through jobs quickly, sometimes staying only months in one plant. Managers can be among a plant\u2019s longest-serving employees.\u201cStrikes started by older workers often come about because of a change in the company, when a company is being merged or restructured,\u201d said Dong Baohua, professor at the East China University of Politics and Law. \u201cOlder workers want to cash in on their years of service.\u201dLine managers may have information about organizational changes before rank-and-file workers. And they may use the threat of a work stoppage to motivate corporate leaders to improve managers\u2019 pay or compensation, lawyers said.Managers \u201care better at motivating and organizing others,\u201d said Yang Zhengxi, the Guangdong Labor Institute\u2019s deputy secretary general, who noted that his observations were based on field research in a Sanyo electronics plant in Shenzhen in 2011. \u201cBut managers will always stay off the front lines in strikes, always be in a mobilizing role.\u201dAccording to the account, compiled by a labor group, a supervisor at Yue Yuen first raised a complaint about the social contributions issue in late March, a few weeks before the strike began. The supervisor and colleagues spread word among workers, who then went to look up their social insurance contributions. The labor group requested anonymity to protect its relationship with Yue Yuen staff.A Yue Yuen worker who would only give his name as Wang said low-level managers were involved in pressuring workers to return to work once the company agreed to their demands. The company told them they would go bankrupt if the managers did not compel the workers to go back to work, he said.During the IBM strike, after a chaotic first day, line managers began to organize the workers, according to a worker who asked not to be identified. Wu Xingcan, 28, worked on and off at Shanmukang Technology, a Samsung supplier, from 2012 until last month, and said the March strike was set off when the factory requested that workers contribute more to the social insurance fund in line with Chinese law. After the strike began, group leaders and supervisors privately encouraged workers to stay off the production line. Shanmukang could not be reached for comment.\u201cThe longer these people have worked in factories, the greater their interest in social insurance, and the more likely they are to incite other workers and participate in strikes themselves,\u201d said Pun Ngai, a sociology professor in the department of applied social sciences at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.At Yue Yuen, the common belief among roughly two dozen employees with whom Reuters spoke during the strike was that the social insurance problem came to light when a newly retired employee went to collect her retirement benefit this year and was surprised that it was so low. Shocked, she returned to the managers\u2019 dormitory and told former colleagues there. Advertisement"}

His herd is apparently not thirsty, preferring to munch on tall grass.\u201cStress is the worst thing you can do for them in terms of quality\u201d of meat, said Mr. Noble, a trim, tanned man with a white goatee. He sells grass-fed beef primarily by word of mouth. \u201cIn order to make any money in agriculture at this scale, you really need to be direct marketing,\u201d said Mr. Noble, whose company earned a profit for the first time last year.But money is not his primary motivation. Mr. Noble waited much of his life to realize his cowboy dreams. \u201cWhen I was younger,\u201d he said, \u201cI never wanted to work inside at a desk,\u201d so, of course, he said, he spent \u201c30 years working inside, at a desk.\u201dAge, suggests Krysta Harden, deputy secretary of the federal Agriculture Department, can be a benefit rather than a barrier. She says she believes new farmers can use business skills, like management and marketing, developed during other careers. \u201cMy mother always told me we\u2019re a family business, but we\u2019re a business,\u201d Ms. Harden said.Ms. Winokur, a native Texan who worked as an elementary-school teacher and earned a doctorate in developmental psychology, traveled extensively to research olive production. She noticed that renowned olive-producing regions \u2014 southern Spain, southern Italy and Egypt \u2014 \u201clooked a lot like Texas.\u201d In 1997, she bought 276 acres of sandy land, which she describes as \u201coceanfront property without the ocean.\u201dShe planted 450 trees, but lost about half in the first winter because she had yet to master irrigation. Despite that setback, her business has flourished. In addition to producing olive oil, she owns a nursery and a restaurant. Ms. Winokur has had considerable help along the way. Experienced farmers in the area served as mentors. One neighbor briefed her on the history of her land, which had long been fallow when she bought it.When she started her orchard, Ms. Winokur could hoist 80-pound bags on her own, but she now must rely on employees to handle strenuous chores. She estimates that it took her 13 years to recruit a \u201cfirst rate\u201d team and advises new farmers to pay well but hire carefully: \u201cDon\u2019t hire because you\u2019re desperate, the first person who comes through the door. Really take your time.\u201dMs. Winokur considers her teaching background a training ground for farming. When she encountered confused children, \u201cI could see that they were looking at me with a blank look,\u201d she said, \u201cthen I would have to shift gears, another avenue to explain a concept to them. And I think that\u2019s what you have to do in farming: If something doesn\u2019t work, you have to be willing to shift.\u201dThat lesson is not lost on Debra Sloane, who recently started a backyard farm in Washington, Conn. She suffered a blow to her self-esteem last year when Cisco Systems eliminated her position as director of global health care. \u201cI went through a grieving process,\u201d said Ms. Sloane, who still uses corporate jargon like \u201ccustomer interface\u201d when discussing farming. After Cisco, she planned to grow exotic mushrooms, having received encouragement from several farm market managers. She then took two seminars for \u201cmushroom nerds\u201d and scrapped the idea because of the capital investment required and her desire to work outdoors. \u201cYou need a lab,\u201d Ms. Sloane said of mushroom production. \u201cYou need to have a grow room with the right temperature, humidity, air circulation, and I said, \u2018Uh-uh.\u2019\u00a0\u201dInstead, Ms. Sloane, a petite woman in a gray long-sleeve T-shirt, jeans and bright blue plastic shoes covered in grass clippings, decided to sell produce at several farmers\u2019 markets, manufacture a vegan cereal and start a C.S.A. \u2014 a community-supported agriculture program. Her 11 customers pay in advance for weekly allotments of fruit and vegetables, easing her company\u2019s cash flow.Ms. Sloane, who declined to give her age, also started working out more, because while she once managed a small staff, she now must count on herself to plant, weed and harvest. She runs twice a week and trains at a nearby CrossFit gym four times a week. Her biggest challenge, she predicts, \u201cis actually not physical but mental. It\u2019s really figuring out how to be exact enough to know that I\u2019m going to have enough to fill 11 bags all summer.\u201dShe forecasts a \u201cfour-figure\u201d profit in her first year and, like most farmers, will supplement her agricultural income with a second job; she is working part time as a consultant for Avizia Inc., a telemedicine technology company.She acknowledges that working for a giant multinational corporation was \u201cego satisfying,\u201d but she finds that life on the farm is \u201csoul satisfying\u201d \u2014 and humbling, especially when she must ask for help from more experienced colleagues. \u201cI can tell you this,\u201d she said near her raised beds of asparagus and strawberries. \u201cI wasn\u2019t humble at Cisco.

{"Headline": "Boom Meets Bust in Texas: Atop Sea of Oil, Poverty Digs In", "Date": "2014-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCaught in PovertyGARDENDALE, Tex. \u2014 From the window of her tin-roofed trailer, Judy Vargas can glimpse a miraculous world. It is as close as the dust kicked up by the trucks barreling by but seems as distant as Mars.As you walk out of her front yard \u2014 where the chewed-off leg of an animal, probably a feral hog caught by a prowling bobcat, rots outside \u2014 a towering natural gas flare peeks over the southerly view. Across the railroad tracks and Interstate 35, a newly reopened railroad interchange stores acres of pipe and receives shipments of sand from Wisconsin to be used in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Next to the terminal is an expanding natural gas processing plant that lies in the heart of the Eagle Ford, a giant shale oil field that here in La Salle County alone produces more than $15 million worth of oil a day, or about one out of every 55 barrels produced in the United States.Judy Vargas, 28, with her son Isaac, 5, lives in a trailer with her three children, her grandmother, and at times other relatives in Gardendale, a colonia near Cotulla, Tex.Decades after Johnson took a teaching job here in 1928, the area, like the country, is a startling and incongruous mix of cascading wealth and crushing hardship. And though the boom has helped produce fortunes for some and comfortable lives for many, for others it exists within a rural landscape of unpaved streets without garbage pickup, where few dare to drink the tap water because it tastes and smells like chlorine.Early one evening in May, Ms. Vargas, 28, cooked spaghetti for her three children and her grandmother. Ms. Vargas, a high school dropout, had just arrived home from her job as a restaurant cook. She and her grandmother, who works as a maid at a motel, make a total of roughly $1,500 a month, far below the federal poverty level of $2,325 for a family of five. Above their dining table, there was a portrait of the Last Supper and, tucked in a corner of the frame, a picture of Ms. Vargas\u2019s uncle, unsmiling in a white uniform and one of at least three incarcerated relatives. The family ate and swatted at flies as trucks roared by.It is a different kind of poverty than it was in 1928, this time surrounded by a buzz of industrial activity, not empty stretches of scrub grass. But it feels as entrenched as ever, reinforced by bad luck, bad choices, a lack of education and the isolation that allows the poor to remain invisible and adrift in lonely, distant orbits.\u201cIt feels the same to us,\u201d Ms. Vargas said of life amid the oil frenzy. \u201cThe money that they have, we didn\u2019t have it before. And we don\u2019t have it now.\u201dGaps in ImprovementsEarly one morning, after putting on makeup underneath a copper-colored strip of flypaper that dangled from the bathroom ceiling, Ms. Vargas slid her youngest child, Isaac, 5, into the back seat of her car. Her shift at the restaurant, a steakhouse in Cotulla where she made $9 an hour, would start soon, and she first had to drop Isaac off with a relative while her two older children were at school.As Ms. Vargas approached the railroad tracks, on one of Gardendale\u2019s few paved roads, she slowed the car. A thick coating covered the street. \u201cIt\u2019s sand,\u201d she said as she drove over it, \u201cbut from where?\u201dOvernight, a truck carrying sand used for drilling wells had dumped some of its load.The fracking sand \u2014 so powdery it seemed scooped from an exclusive beach \u2014 stretched for about 100 yards on roads outside homes and the Gardendale Qwik Stop, the colonia\u2019s lone store. In 2012, federal health officials issued an alert about the health hazards workers faced from exposure to fracking-sand dust. Breathing so-called silica dust can cause silicosis, a lung disease.No one was sure if the sand had been left by accident or on purpose, but people suspected that the driver of an overweight truck had lightened his load. They are unlikely to find out. Gardendale has no mayor, no police department, and only a handful of tilting signs and streetlights. It is often used as an illegal dumping ground.An estimated 500,000 people live in about 2,300 colonias in Texas, along its 1,200-mile border with Mexico. Many colonias have benefited from infrastructure improvements in recent years. Others remain institutionalized shantytowns without basic services like water and sewers.At least in part because of the oil economy, Gardendale is one of the better-off colonias. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found in a report to be released this year that 42 percent of the population of colonias in six Texas border counties \u2014 not including La Salle \u2014 lived below the poverty line, compared with 14.3 percent nationally. The median annual household income was $29,000. In La Salle County, other studies have shown that 39 percent of children live in poverty.The boom has both given and taken away. School officials bought 1,300 iPads, one for every student in the district. And there are jobs \u2014 well paid in the oil fields for some, marginal in fast food joints and cheap motels for others.There have been 11 motor vehicle fatalities in La Salle County this year, up from two in 2007, which officials blame in part on a population boom and increased traffic from the oil and gas activity. Rents have skyrocketed. Newly hired teachers had such a hard time finding housing they could afford that the Cotulla school district opened its own trailer park for them.Texas has reaped tremendous financial benefits from oil and gas. But the poor in the colonias seldom own the leasing rights for the natural resources that lie under the ground they live on. One-third of Texas\u2019 $48 billion in tax revenue last year came directly or indirectly from the oil and gas industry, said Bernard Weinstein of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Portions of the revenues go into the state\u2019s general fund as well as its so-called Rainy Day Fund, but very little of it is spent on social services and programs to assist the poor, although some helps finance public schools and universities.So, despite the boom, Texas has some of the highest rates of poverty in the nation and ranks first in the percentage of residents without health insurance. Republican leaders have supported tapping the Rainy Day Fund for one-time investments in water and transportation infrastructure, but they have blocked attempts to use the fund for education and other services, arguing that it was designed to cover emergencies and not recurring expenses.\u201cDespite the bounty of the Eagle Ford, which is considerable and on the whole clearly positive, it is not a rising tide that lifts all boats,\u201d said Ray Perryman, a leading Texas economist and author based in Waco. He noted that Texas had long had a philosophy of limited government and an aversion to spending on social services, an attitude intensified by the current political environment.\u201cTexas is not a good place to be poor, and there is little political appetite for change,\u201d he said.Surrounded by ActivityOne day in May, Colt Ringer, 28, limped along near Ms. Vargas\u2019s trailer wearing a dusty black cowboy hat and carrying a .22-caliber Magnum revolver and .45-caliber pistol in holsters at his hip. He was returning home empty-handed after hunting feral hogs, which he kills for sport and for food.\u201cAll of us are poor, in our own way,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t get nothing off these wells right out here, because I don\u2019t own the land. That just goes to show the golden rule: He who has the gold makes the rule.\u201dThe people of Gardendale, first settled in 1908, are an isolated, eclectic lot. Some are poor, but others are lower middle class. Goats are kept in the front yard of one house; a Cadillac is parked at another.In 1996, Ms. Vargas\u2019s grandmother, Ernestina Salinas, 68, paid just $300 for the lot they live on. Using $1,000 she made picking fruits and vegetables in Minnesota, she bought a run-down trailer that lacked running water and electricity. In 1998, a flood destroyed the trailer, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency provided her with a more modern one that she has frequently renovated.At one point recently, 10 relatives were living in the trailer. Ms. Vargas and her three children slept on one king-size bed. Ms. Salinas, who has heart problems and diabetes, slept with a cross over her bed in a room awash with the fragrance of incense.Lately, the family has been living on about $250 a week. Ms. Salinas receives an additional $500 monthly in Social Security benefits, but over all those inside the trailer rely very little on public assistance. Medicare pays most of the cost of Ms. Salinas\u2019s drugs, but with co-payments she pays roughly $40 a month for medicine. Ms. Vargas said she had no health insurance, and pays for most of her medical bills out of pocket. They rarely follow the news, but in a state hostile to President Obama\u2019s health care law, they do not understand the law and get the impression it is a shambles. No one in the family has applied for health care subsidies.There is disagreement among officials, oil company executives and economists over why poverty persists amid the boom in the Eagle Ford counties.\u201cThe oil companies come by for Thanksgiving with turkeys, or they may have a function to have pictures taken to show the world they are socially responsible and then you\u2019ll never see them again,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said.But Mr. Rodriguez and others were skeptical of those who were unemployed in a region teeming with jobs and new businesses.\u201cThe fact is we are handing out big checks to people, and we are still short on people who want to work,\u201d said Chris Faulkner, chief executive of Breitling Energy, an oil company that operates in La Salle County. \u201cI would think that if I was living in one of these colonias, I would be running for the opportunity to say, \u2018This is my big chance, and I am going to jump on it,\u2019 but they are not doing that.\u201dBut at the trailer, there was much more focus on getting through the days than on getting ahead.Late last year, Ms. Salinas returned from working the fields in Minnesota to find that squatters and scrap metal thieves had broken into the trailer. They stripped off the trailer\u2019s electrical wiring, stole the water heater and left behind food and dirty dishes. Ms. Vargas, who has lived in the trailer off and on since she was 10 or 11, returned to Gardendale from Dallas with her children and her common-law husband, worried about Ms. Salinas\u2019s safety.Life, it seems, is lived one step ahead of disaster. One day, sheriff\u2019s deputies came to the trailer after a dispute that began when the girlfriend of Ms. Vargas\u2019s cousin left a 10-month-old baby by the side of the road in front of the trailer.Some days, Ms. Vargas appreciates the colonia\u2019s quirky isolation. Other times, in a trailer held up on the dirt by concrete slabs, next to the pile of ashes where they burn garbage because no one picks it up, ordinary life seems extraordinarily hard. By June, the temperature was already above 100 as she drove through town. She rolled down all four windows \u2014 the air conditioner was busted \u2014 and dust from the 18-wheelers filled the car like cigarette smoke, coating the Bible she kept inside.A Hard but Satisfying LifeIn early June, Ms. Vargas was at the kitchen table opening a box of cake mix. Her husband, Erick Olivares, 28, lit the charcoals in the rusty barbecue grill outside. The children splashed in a plastic pool. They were having a cookout. Mr. Olivares had been released from jail several days earlier. The crosses he had made for her and the children in jail hung from strings around the trailer.Ms. Vargas laughed more, smiled more than she had in weeks. \u201cI am very happy,\u201d she said as she cracked the eggs for the strawberry cake. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be? My life is complete.\u201dMr. Olivares had spent six weeks in jail on charges of marijuana possession. He was optimistic about finding a job, but had not yet done so. He was reluctant about working in the oil fields. \u201cIt crossed my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pays good, but I don\u2019t want to lose my arms or hands for that kind of money.\u201d Later, he gave another reason: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a convicted felon, they ain\u2019t going to hire me.\u201dMs. Vargas quit her job at the steakhouse and returned to a place she had worked before \u2014 the motel where her grandmother is a maid. She cleaned rooms and pressed shirts for $9 an hour, and got a second job as a waitress at another restaurant in Cotulla, earning $5 an hour, plus tips. Some days she worked at both jobs.But the family was falling behind financially. It cost more than $2,400 to bail Mr. Olivares out of jail. Ms. Vargas had paid $820 but still owed the rest. When Ms. Salinas had hired a neighbor to rip out the cracked particleboard floor in the trailer and put in faux-wood flooring, one of Ms. Vargas\u2019s children had thrown the man\u2019s car key into a smoldering fire they had made outside to burn some trash. Ms. Vargas owed the man $300 for a new key and the cost of a tow. Her cellphone service was cut off when she failed to pay the bill.Ms. Vargas dreams her children will have a better life. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want my kid to be in no motel and no restaurant, getting paid minimum wage,\u201d she said.One of the ushers was a recovering drug addict. The pastor, Mark Linares, runs a barbecue stand outside his house. Ms. Vargas and her family walked in late, as Mr. Linares asked the audience to pray for a truck driver whose daughter-in-law was in a coma.Everyone filed out of the red brick building, where there is a plaque by the front doors. Ms. Vargas and Ms. Salinas did not notice it. This was the old schoolhouse where President Johnson first saw extreme poverty in 1928. During the collection, the worshipers had passed around a basket. Ms. Vargas contributes when she can. This evening she had nothing to put in.Caught in Poverty: Articles in this series are examining\nAmerican hardship 50 years after the\nwar on poverty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Need to Read the Fed\u2019s Beige Book if You Read This Instead", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyThe Federal Reserve will not be providing much of a public service when it releases its Beige Book economic survey Wednesday afternoon, as it does eight times each year.That\u2019s because there is not a lot of there there. A former Fed official once compared the survey\u2019s approach to asking your uncle about the health of the economy. The Minneapolis Fed concluded in a 1999 study of the value of the Beige Book, \u201cThe short answer is \u2014 not much.\u201dIndeed, the Fed started releasing the Beige Book, in 1983, precisely because officials considered the contents harmless. To underscore the point, they put a beige cover on it.Fed watchers abhor a vacuum, so the Beige Book is carefully parsed for evidence of the Fed\u2019s intentions. Save yourself the time. Read this history, then go read something else.The Redbook served its purpose. The regional presidents talked less, at least as long as Mr. Burns remained in charge. Better yet, in 1983, the Fed discovered another valuable use for the Redbook: It made a wonderful smokescreen.The Fed, by then under the leadership of Paul Volcker, was in the midst of a historic and painful campaign to drive down inflation. There was growing demand for the Fed to provide more information about its decision-making.Walter Fauntroy, a civil-rights leader who had become the District of Columbia\u2019s representative in Congress, chaired the subcommittee that oversaw monetary policy. In February that year, he asked the Fed to publish its Green Book at the same time it announced the results of its policy meetings.So the Fed struck a deal with Mr. Fauntroy. The Fed would release the Redbook instead \u2014 two weeks before each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.This seemed like a victory for transparency, but in the view of Fed officials, the opposite was true. By releasing the Redbook two weeks early, the Fed hoped to underscore that the contents were out of date. The committee would have newer information by the time it made decisions.The book also got a new cover. At first it was sometimes described as the \u201cTan Book,\u201d but we now think of it as beige.Perhaps the best defense of the Beige Book is that the reporting process itself is valuable for the regional reserve banks, informing their assessments of local conditions. The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, by design, includes five of the regional presidents, alongside the seven governors based in Washington, to increase the diversity of views.Such anecdotal information can also be misleading, however. In the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, some regional presidents in areas where housing prices had increased relatively modestly drew false comfort from local trends. Moreover, in reading transcripts of past meetings, it\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that Fed presidents, like everyone else, tend to choose anecdotes that support their opinions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Construction Spending Reaches Its Highest Level Since 2009", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConstruction spending posted modest gains in April, driven by an uptick in home building and government construction that lifted total activity to the highest level since March 2009.Spending rose 0.2 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $953.5 billion, the Commerce Department said on Monday. The government also revised March activity to a 0.6 percent gain, up from an initial estimate of a 0.2 percent increase.The small April improvement, which was lower than economists had expected, was the third consecutive increase after spending decreased 0.4 percent in January. The cumulative growth over the past three months suggests that the construction industry is recovering from the harsh winter and will provide a boost to growth in the months ahead. The overall economy contracted at an annual rate of 1 percent in the first quarter of the year, but analysts forecast that growth will recover to a rate of around 3.8 percent in the next period. The expectation is that as strong gains in hiring help lift consumer spending, other sectors including construction will also rebound.In April, residential construction edged up 0.1 percent, the lowest monthly gain since a decline last October. But the small increase followed strong gains over the past five months that helped lift spending on housing to a seasonally adjusted $378.5 billion, the highest level since March 2008.Government construction spending rose 0.8 percent to a rate of $267 billion. This sector has been struggling because of budget cutbacks at all levels of government. Total construction spending is 8.6 percent higher than it was a year ago, led by a 17.2 percent increase in housing construction. Nonresidential construction is up by 5.6 percent from a year ago, while government projects are just 1.2 percent higher. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Rwanda, Looking to Art to Soothe", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultured TravelerA manager of the Ivuka Arts\u00a0gallery\u00a0in Kigali, Rwanda. The capital\u2019s lively art scene has turned this once-traumatized city into a place of art openings, literary readings, dance performances and concerts.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019ll find it yourself,\u201d the artist Strong Karakire told me on the phone, when I asked for directions to his studio in Nyamirambo, a lively neighborhood in the Rwandan capital of Kigali where dirt roads climb the steep hills past modest dwellings. \u201cJust wait at the petrol station, and I\u2019ll come get you.\u201dA few minutes later, Mr. Karakire zoomed up on the back of one of Kigali\u2019s ubiquitous motorcycle taxis and collected me. On that balmy November day, the trip to his studio wound through labyrinthine alleys and a bustling fruit and vegetable market where sellers laid out their wares on colorful blankets. Tinny strains of dance music emanated from idling minibuses adorned with photorealistic portraits of hip-hop musicians, and small children trying to play soccer on the uneven, sloping red earth in front of a green-and-white mosque shouted out excited greetings as we passed by. We turned at a high brick wall and immediately came upon one of Mr. Karakire\u2019s creations. A jumble of discarded loafers and strappy sandals had been glued to an oddly shaped slab of cardboard mounted on the bricks and spray-painted blue and red. Nearby was a small garden, full of spiky potted plants, pink geraniums and a ladderlike structure hung with a nest of silver-treated wine bottles and firewood. Twenty years after a genocide left an estimated 800,000 people, mostly Tutsi men, women and children, dead over a period of 100 days, Rwanda is on the rise. Its economy is growing; tourism is increasing. And unexpectedly, an art world is flourishing in Kigali, the pleasant million-person capital of lush hillsides and flowering trees. Mr. Karakire is one of the many young artists forging an art scene in the city, where numerous galleries, art-focused community centers and independent studios have popped up in recent years. Some works are inspired by the country\u2019s devastating recent past, while others, brightly painted and optimistic, look to the future. The lively art scene has turned this once-quiet and traumatized city into a place where not just art openings but also literary readings, dance performances and concerts take place regularly in the courtyards of galleries, and artists give lunchtime lectures at cooperative working spaces. A number of tech start-ups and a fashion collective run by fledgling designers have also found a toehold in the safe and almost eerily tidy Rwandan capital.The artists here are largely self-taught, and some, like Mr. Karakire, are still trying to work through difficult experiences from their country\u2019s past. \u201cI\u2019m doing art like therapy,\u201d he said from inside his three-room studio hung with both abstract and figurative paintings, mostly in dark colors. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I choose to live,\u201d added the wiry-framed artist who listens to techno music while he works. Finding these destinations might take a bit of effort. Several years ago, English became an official language alongside Kinyarwanda, usurping French, and the Francophone street names became numbered. While being an Anglophone visitor is much easier now, most locals do not use the new street names, and thus most galleries in Kigali can be found only by getting turn-by-turn directions from the nearest landmark. Art institutions did not even exist in the country a decade ago. But in 2006 an improbable decision was made to convert a former royal palace into the country\u2019s first contemporary art museum. The location chosen for the establishment surprised many: The neo-Classical building atop a scenic hill that now houses the National Art Gallery is in the southwestern city of Nyanza, about 90 minutes from Kigali; it once served as the stately home of the Rwandan Supreme Court.The directors of the new museum faced a challenge: How does one build a contemporary art collection from scratch in a country where there were very few arts practitioners? The solution they arrived at was to hold yearly art contests for Rwandans, where the winning works were bought for the museum\u2019s collection. Each competition required artists to submit works that addressed a theme tied to the country\u2019s horrific history. The 2006 topic was \u201cpeace and tolerance\u201d and in 2007 artists worked under the rubric \u201cNot to forget, to remember.\u201d \u201cNo one was aware of the importance of art in this heavily hurting society,\u201d said Lia Gieling, a former curator at the National Art Gallery. \u201cIt was very important to demonstrate how artists could contribute to healing and reconciliation.\u201dThe contests helped to jump-start the Rwandan art scene, and after three rounds and several donations, the museum\u2019s collection grew to about 125 paintings, sculptures and installations. The Rwandan artist Jean Claude Sekijege, who died in 2007, created some of the most intriguing works there. One of his sculptures is made of burlap, plastic and twine and depicts an ostrich with bound feet. Another remarkable work is a painted plaster cast of a woman\u2019s torso, her arm made from the metal barrel of a rifle. The ride from Nyanza back to Kigali passed through misty valleys and craggy hills laden with eucalyptus trees and dense vegetation. Women carrying bundles on their heads crossed terraced fields blanketed with electric green rice paddies and apiaries. The road often curved sharply, allowing for panoramic views of the dramatic Rwandan countryside. Suddenly, all those landscape paintings of rolling hills that I\u2019d seen in Kigali made more sense. The city galleries and exhibition spaces display a riot of colors and artistic styles. Paintings are often hung with only inches of space between them or lean in stacks against the wall. Artists work and sometimes live on the properties, and are regularly on hand to explain their work. In some of the galleries, community outreach \u2014 art classes for orphans and neighborhood kids, programs focused on helping those with HIV or disadvantaged women \u2014 plays an important role. On my visit, a 23-year-old artist named Timothy Wandulu showed me around the gallery and explained his own installations made of recycled materials. Using the work space at the gallery, he had built a small house from Inyange (stork) brand milk cartons, and had made furniture from multicolored plastic jerrycans. \u201cWhen we came to Inema we had problems with water and had to bring it in plastic bottles,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I made an installation.\u201d Carole Karemera, an actress and musician who is active in the city\u2019s cultural scene, said she sees the Rwandan art world as a \u201cbridge between the past and the future.\u201d\u201cOur past is not glorious at all, but we are gloriously present,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are excited about who we can become.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Number of French Jews Emigrating to Israel Rises ", "Date": "2014-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 For Tiffany Taieb Nizard, the decision to abandon France for Israel came this month when a French-born man was accused of gunning down four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels in an anti-Semitic attack.It was just the tipping point. Earlier, Ms. Taieb Nizard, 32, a mother of two, says she was punched on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es by a gang of Muslim girls who called her \u201cdirty Jew.\u201d Last year, she said, a man in her neighborhood on the edge of Paris complained to the police about her sister\u2019s Sukkah, a hut erected to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. She insists that her Orthodox husband wear a baseball cap over his skullcap to avoid harassment. A graduate in management, she was also struggling to find a job.\u201cI love France, and this is my country, but I am disgusted now,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Israel there is an army that will protect us. Here, I can no longer see a future for my children.\u201dJewish leaders say the emigration is being driven by a combination of factors, including the cultural pull of Israel and France\u2019s flat economy, especially for the younger generation drawn by the possibility of other opportunities in the more vibrant Israeli economy.However, he added, shifting political winds were heightening the anxieties of European Jewry. \u201cFrench anxiety represents the general anxiety of Jews in Europe, who fear for their safety and future,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the situation continues, there will be an accelerated movement out of Europe.\u201dLast year, 3,288 French Jews emigrated to Israel \u2014 a 72 percent increase over 2012. For the first time since 1948, the year Israel was founded, French \u00e9migr\u00e9s surpassed the number of American \u00e9migr\u00e9s. This year, the Jewish Agency says it expects some 5,000 to make aliyah, the Hebrew word for immigration that means \u201cto ascend.\u201d The agency said that while immigration to Israel was stagnating globally, French Jews were the notable exception.The would-be emigrants would have to bid adieu to France\u2019s 35-hour workweek and five-week vacations, learn Hebrew, forsake foie gras, find a job, work on Sundays and, depending on their age, serve in the army.In return, he said, they would gain cultural harmony by living in the land of their ancestors and benefit from a dynamic economy. And despite Israel\u2019s reputation as a land of perpetual war and conflict, he added, Israelis lived an average 81.8 years compared with 81.5 years in France. \u201cYou gain three months,\u201d he said.\u201cNo one is saying you will become a C.E.O. overnight. But if you learn Hebrew and are willing to work, there are opportunities,\u201d he said. For the younger generation, economics as much as anti-Semitism was prompting decisions to depart.Elie Jaskarzec, 26, a biotechnology engineer who attended the information session, plans to emigrate in October and eventually hopes to start his own company. He said he was particularly put off by the cost of doing business in France. \u201cThis is a country in decline,\u201d he added. For Ms. Taieb Nizard, whose parents fled Tunisia for France in the 1960s because of anti-Semitism, memories of oppression run deep. For her, she said, she felt that history was now repeating itself.\u201cI will miss many things in France,\u201d she said on a recent day, munching on a pastry. \u201cBut I think my soul will feel better there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Rules for Auditors? Don\u2019t Hold Your Breath", "Date": "2014-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceChris Cox, who as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission tried to bring international accounting rules to the United States, has now done an about-face.\u201cThe first thing we should give up is the counterproductive fiction that the United States is going to replace Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with International Financial Reporting Standards,\u201d he said in a speech at a conference in Pasadena, Calif., last week.\u201cThe prospect of full-scale I.F.R.S. in our lifetimes has ceased to be. It is bereft of life. It rests in peace.\u201dHe recalled that as chairman he had begun a process intended to eventually require United States companies to switch to international accounting rules. \u201cBut that was several years ago, and a great deal has changed since then. Today, I come to bury I.F.R.S., not to praise them.\u201dAs it happens, that speech came at a time when the current S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary Jo White, has raised hopes among I.F.R.S. supporters that she might be more open to wider use of international rules than was her predecessor, Mary L. Schapiro. I.F.R.S. is not dead in the United States, although there is little or no chance of a complete conversion to international rules, something Mr. Cox envisioned when he led the commission. It seems possible that some United States companies will be allowed to convert to international rules if they wish to do so. Whether or not his crystal ball was clouded, Mr. Cox could have made better disclosures in his speech to the S.E.C. and Financial Reporting Institute Conference. He devoted much of the speech to an attack on proposed rules to change the accounting for leases. He went into considerable detail about what was wrong with the proposal, which would force many companies to show leased items, like cars and computers, as assets, along with an offsetting liability of the amount owed on the lease. The widespread view among accountants has long been that many leases are little more than disguised financing arrangements and that the assets and liabilities should be reported, just as they would be if the company had bought the item and borrowed money to pay for it. Mr. Cox does not like the proposal.When I suggested to Mr. Cox that he should have mentioned the fact he had a client involved in the dispute, he seemed surprised. \u201cNo one paid me to make that speech,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are my views.\u201dIn the speech, he attributed much of the problem with the proposed rule to the International Accounting Standards Board, which sets international rules, rather than to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets United States rules and has been closely cooperating with the international board, although it now appears likely that the final rules issued by the two boards will differ in some respects.The proposed rule, he said, had a \u201cheavy perfume of I.F.R.S.\u201d He complained that the international board \u201cisn\u2019t listening to American stakeholders\u201d and said the United States board is \u201cbecoming more like the I.A.S.B.\u201dThe French later persuaded the European Union to allow French banks to ignore part of the accounting rule that was eventually adopted by the board.Ms. White, by the way, is married to John W. White, the former head of corporation finance at the commission. The S.E.C. this week said she was traveling and not available to comment. Mr. White, now a New York-based partner in the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, declined to discuss the issue.In January, the parent of the F.A.S.B., the Financial Accounting Foundation, announced that it would contribute $3 million to the parent of the I.A.S.B. Persons close to the foundation said the S.E.C. had strongly encouraged the contribution.Advocates of international standards took heart from that contribution, which may have been aimed at preserving United States influence until the S.E.C. acts. While there seems to be no chance that the S.E.C. will require the use of international rules \u2014 there is far too much opposition to that, particularly from smaller companies \u2014 it is possible that the S.E.C. could decide to allow United States multinational companies that wished to do so use the international rules. An argument for that move would be that United States companies could use the same rules as their main foreign competitors, making comparisons easier for investors.In Japan, companies can now choose among three sets of rules \u2014 Japanese GAAP, United States GAAP and I.F.R.S. In an interview, Hans Hoogervorst, the I.A.S.B. chairman, said he expected his board\u2019s rules would gain market share as time goes on.Far from reaching the goal of \u201ca global set of high-quality accounting standards,\u201d the world may be heading to a marketing contest where companies can choose the rules they like.

{"Headline": "The Unexpected Ceasefire in Washington\u2019s Tax Wars", "Date": "2014-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySettling for Tie in BeltwayLike many Republicans this year, Ernst, a Senate candidate, doesn\u2019t have a tax-cut plan. \u201cRepublican candidates are not campaigning on a specific tax cut,\u201d said Grover Norquist, the party\u2019s loudest anti-tax voice.Nor are Democrats lining up to do the opposite. For instance, a marquee Senate candidate for the party, Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky, would raise additional government revenue by closing loopholes \u2014 not by raising the 39.6 percent top rate.That makes this an unusual moment in the partisan fight over tax rates that has raged since supply-side economics emerged in the late 1970s. Washington cut the 70 percent top rate by more than half under Ronald Reagan, raised it under George H.W. Bush, raised it more under Bill Clinton, then cut it again under George W. Bush.Now, in the wake of the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d deal between President Obama and Congress as 2012 turned into 2013, which restored the Clinton-era top rate, Washington has hit the pause button.\u201cWe\u2019ve reached sort of a stasis,\u201d said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, a Democrat who serves on the Finance Committee. \u201cNo one\u2019s totally content with it, but they\u2019re willing to let it lay there.\u201dThe reasons are partly practical. The fiscal cliff deal materialized only because the looming expiration of all President Bush\u2019s tax cuts forced Congress to act. House Republicans can block any new Democratic effort to raise rates; President Obama can veto any Republican effort to cut them.But philosophical shifts have also played a role. In the Tea Party era, Mr. Norquist said, concern about debt and deficits has given spending reduction a \u201ccoequal\u201d place with tax-cutting in Republican economic theology.\u201cTo gain popularity for a broader conservative agenda, we need to offer something more than just updated versions of plans that have failed to gain traction for decades,\u201d the report concluded. It recommended new tax credits for parents with children as a way to lift middle-class incomes and conservatives\u2019 political fortunes.The \u201cstasis\u201d Mr. Schumer described doesn\u2019t bother most Democrats, who have long faced some vulnerability from promoting higher rates. The party\u2019s improved performance in recent elections among affluent voters has also tempered the appeal of taxing them.In the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, a challenge from the left to Hillary Rodham Clinton could scramble that equation. But \u201cthe default setting right now is, look at loopholes,\u201d said William Galston, former domestic policy director in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House.Mr. Norquist calls the current cease-fire on the issue temporary. If Republicans gain control of the Senate this fall, he predicted, they\u2019ll push overhauling the tax code as a means of reducing rates.\u201cThey\u2019re looking past the current situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re moving to tax reform, which will be a tax cut, instead of talking about the tax cut. They\u2019re not leading with that.\u201dThe evidence so far doesn\u2019t show much momentum. Dave Camp, the chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, recently completed an arduous process of combing the tax code for loopholes to close in order to simplify and reduce rates.Mr. Camp ended up with three individual rates, instead of the current seven. His top rate was the Bush-era 35 percent, instead of the current 39.6 percent.But to prevent lost revenue from increasing deficits, Mr. Camp proposed cutting popular deductions for mortgage interest and state and local taxes. Fellow House Republicans stiff-armed his plan as if it were President Obama leaning in for a hug.There were similar problems with proposals to cut the 35 percent top rate for corporations, which President Obama and Republicans alike have embraced in concept. Mr. Camp proposed a new rate of 25 percent.But a new tax on banks he included to keep it \u201crevenue neutral\u201d drew howls from Wall Street lobbyists. Selling the plan to financially squeezed middle-class voters would pose a steep additional hurdle.The Iowa campaign of Ms. Ernst, who faces Representative Bruce Braley for the seat of the retiring Democratic senator Tom Harkin, illustrates the state of the debate.In the \u201cSqueal\u201d ad that made her famous, Ms. Ernst does not mention the word taxes. Instead she slams \u201cwasteful spending\u201d and calls for government to \u201clive within our means.\u201d\u201cWhen I get to Washington,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ll know how to cut pork.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a Wall Street Journal columnist.

The girl\u2019s father then \u201ccut their throats,\u201d he said.The police arrested the family members, who said they were embarrassed by the marriage of their daughter, Muafia Hussein, to a man from what they considered to be a less important tribe.In many areas of Pakistan, the killing of a woman whose behavior is seen as immodest is accepted according to traditions.In recent killings, behavior considered to be immodest has included singing, looking out of a window or talking to a man who is not a relative. For a woman to marry a man of her own choice is considered an unacceptable insult by many families.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 869 so-called honor killings were reported in the news media last year. But the true figure is probably much higher because many cases are never reported.The Pakistani government, struggling to cope with a weak economy and a Taliban insurgency, does not collect centralized statistics and has no strategy to combat the killings.Even if a woman\u2019s killer is convicted, Pakistani law allows her family to forgive the killer, who then goes free.Many families simply nominate a member to do the killing, then formally forgive the killer.Such was the case last week when a tribal council in the Muzaffargarh district in central Pakistan sentenced another couple to death for marrying for love.That couple\u2019s lawyer, Zia Kiyyani, said the two had appealed for police protection after their marriage on June 21, but had not received any.The family of Mehreen Bibi, 19, met her to take her from her husband\u2019s family, swearing on the Quran that they would not harm her and would hold a proper wedding ceremony, Mr. Kiyyani said.\u201cDuring this the girl shouted, cried and mourned for her life and her husband\u2019s life because she knew that they will kill both of them,\u201d he said.When she returned home, the police said, a family member shot her. Her husband went into hiding, and her father registered the murder complaint so he could forgive the killer, Mr. Kiyyani said. \u201cThat will end the case,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Map, Defined by Gas", "Date": "2014-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Get ready for a new map of global economic power, this one redrawn by American shale gas. It could change the landscape in two ways: reviving hope for American manufacturing, and prompting an American-Russian rivalry over the export of energy to Europe and Asia.For decades, Americans have watched the cheap cost of factory labor catapult China to wealth and superpower status, and allow economies elsewhere \u2014 southern Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe \u2014 to climb the ladder of economic development. This has set in motion the largest transfer in global wealth and power since the rise of the West in the 18th century, while the West accustomed itself to growing unemployment, urban blight and rising opposition to globalization itself.But shale gas could well reverse this trend, and in the process redraw some important strategic relationships. Natural gas is cleaner than coal; it is cheaper than nuclear power, and easier and quicker to develop. Existing technology can locate and mine huge gas reserves that have been detected but are difficult to reach, and then transport the gas across the world. That promises to make gas the critical energy source for global industrial output, displacing the cost of local labor from its pivotal role as the measure of where to build the most profitable new factory. In the next phase of globalization, the local cost of natural gas is more likely to be that yardstick. And that, in turn, could shift the relative weight of global wealth and political power.President Obama is being realistic when he promises a return of manufacturing to America on the back of abundant and cheap gas supplies. Recognizing America\u2019s potential, even energy producers like Qatar and Azerbaijan are already investing in the exploration for and distribution of American natural gas. And many in Asia now look to America as the next emerging market to fuel global economic growth.The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster accelerated the turn to natural gas; in its aftermath, Japan and then Germany cut their dependence on nuclear power. Now experts predict that by 2035, natural gas consumption could grow by more than 50 percent, from 3.3 trillion cubic meters a year to 5.1 trillion \u2014 25 percent of expected global energy demand. That has brought a spike in investment in gas pipelines and in facilities needed to transport liquefied natural gas, in anticipation of a restored American comparative advantage in manufacturing. Already, natural gas prices in America have fallen to less than half of the $17 to $18 per million B.T.U.s that they are in Asia. There is plenty of gas in energy hubs like Qatar, or under the Mediterranean and South China Seas, but it would be very costly to extract and transport, making it difficult for Asian economies to maintain their current cost advantages. And China\u2019s labor costs are already inching up for other reasons.So in coming decades, manufacturers may well find it difficult to justify paying twice as much for Middle Eastern gas imported to China as they would for natural gas extracted in the United States.In such a world, China could find itself struggling more in its role as America\u2019s main trade rival, and in the geostrategic role it feels its national wealth can buy.But that doesn\u2019t mean a shale gas revolution ensures America\u2019s unrivaled primacy. Instead, it would shift the focus of rivalry in the direction of competition between America and Russia (and, in the future, perhaps Iran), for the position of the world\u2019s most powerful energy supplier.Iran and Russia have the largest reserves of natural gas in the world, and that will not change soon. Their reserves are cheaper and easier to extract than much of America\u2019s, because they do not require the advanced technology and vast water resources that shale gas extraction demands. Nor does extraction from traditional sources carry as many risks to the environment as shale gas does, with its dependence on fracking. So it is conceivable that Russia and Iran would use their gas to lure manufacturing to their own territory, in the way China once used cheap labor.But it is more likely that Russia \u2014 and Iran, too, if agreement over its nuclear program allowed the lifting of sanctions \u2014 would simply get richer by supplying cheap gas to America\u2019s economic rivals, and in the process keep them economically competitive with America. Russia already plays such a role with Germany, providing it with gas at prices comparable to what American manufacturers pay. The recent $400 billion gas deal between Russia and China promises to guarantee China low energy costs by one day allowing China, like Germany, to get Russian gas through pipelines. Russia could also enter into a similar agreement with Korea and Japan.In this scenario, there is a geostrategic challenge for the United States: Russia could emerge with great sway over both the supply and the price of natural gas, potentially playing the role that Saudi Arabia played at the height of global dependence on Middle Eastern oil, and making all of America\u2019s main economic rivals in Europe and Asia dependent on Russia.To avoid such an outcome, the United States must start now to develop a global energy strategy, designed to compete with Russia and to provide both Europe and Asia with viable alternatives to Russian gas. One possibility is that America could help China develop its own shale gas.Most important, Congress should approve the export of America\u2019s natural gas and support the building of terminals for shipping it. And America should, like Russia, be looking now to seal long-term gas deals with Europe and Asia. That could allow the United States to emerge a winner on both fronts of the new map of economic rivalries. Vali R.

We are still feeling the ramifications.Preliminary findings suggest that this trend is alarming in almost every respect. Just one example: the drying up of cognitively demanding jobs is having a cascade effect. College graduates are forced to take jobs beneath their level of educational training, moving into clerical and service positions instead of into finance and high tech.This cascade eliminates opportunities for those without college degrees who would otherwise fill those service and clerical jobs. These displaced workers are then forced to take even less demanding, less well-paying jobs, in a process that pushes everyone down. At the bottom, the unskilled are pushed out of the job market altogether.\u201cMany higher skilled workers have moved down the occupation ladder and accepted less challenging employment,\u201d Beaudry wrote in an emailed response to my inquiry about this development. \u201cThis movement down has been very detrimental to the low skilled, as higher skilled workers have taken many of \u2018their\u2019 jobs.\u201dIn these papers, the authors describe \u201ca clear break in 2000,\u201d a sudden shift in the job prospects of college graduates. They write that in earlier years, \u201ceach successive entry cohort has a higher share in cognitive occupations at the outset of their working lives.\u201d From 1980 to 2000, the demand for highly skilled college graduates provided increased opportunity for good wages and advancement.Beginning in 2000, however, each graduating class has encountered a smaller share of well-paying, high-prestige jobs. By 2010, the openings into these occupations were back to 1990 levels, the authors write.Beaudry and his colleagues document their findings with some striking charts.Figure 1 shows the steady rise from 1980 to 2000 in the cognitive level demanded by different employment tasks. In other words, a growing number of jobs required better reasoning ability, greater creativity and stronger management skills, until there was a sharp drop-off.Beaudry, Green and Sand make the case that the technology bubble that burst in 2000 was far more significant than generally recognized. In their view, information technology underwent a period of revolutionary growth in the 1980s and 1990s, spurring a huge demand for well-educated workers to manage surging capital investments in computers, software and electronics.At the turn of the 21st century, however, the I.T. revolution entered what the authors call a \u201cmaturity stage,\u201d in which much of \u201cthe new capital is in place\u201d and \u201ccognitive task workers are only needed to maintain the new capital.\u201dBeaudry, Green and Sand illustrate the decline in I.T. capital investment. Figure 2 shows investment in information processing and software as a percentage of gross national product from the late 1940s to 2013. After climbing steadily from 1950 onward, the percentage drops precipitously from 2000 to 2003 and continues to fall at a slower rate through 2012.Even more striking is the trend illustrated in Figure 3, which shows an almost vertical drop between 2000 and 2003 in the percentage of G.N.P. invested in computers and peripheral equipment.Because these downward trends in capital investment and in the level of demand for high-skill workers were already in evidence between 2000 and 2007, the possibility that the post-2000 shifts were the result of the 2008 financial collapse should be discounted, according to Beaudry, Green and Sand.I asked two labor experts, Autor and Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, about their work. Autor and Katz both confirmed by email that the Beaudry analysis was credible and disturbing. Autor described the displacement of lesser skilled workers by high-skill college graduates as \u201ca bit like musical chairs. Very bad.\u201dKatz agreed that \u201clots of new college graduates are moving into the service sector, that is, into traditionally non-college jobs, displacing young non-college workers.\u201d While graduates of elite colleges \u2014 by definition a minority of all those getting degrees \u2014 continue to do well in the labor market, \u201cthe average college graduate is experiencing slow wage gains,\u201d a trend that is \u201cworrisome and problematic,\u201d Katz said.Two other studies have produced similar findings.These trends are certain to reverberate into the political system.The downward pressures mean that the problem of declining opportunity will now be a fact of life across nearly all classes.Insofar as men and women are pushed into jobs that pay less and provide less satisfaction, their hostility to both those above them and those below them is likely to intensify. Of course it\u2019s impossible to say for sure, but one possible development in an environment of general downward mobility is that fewer people will keep the common good in view while focusing on their own self-interest. Competition in the workplace is likely to become increasingly pervasive, and backlash over affirmative action policies benefiting minorities and women threatens to mobilize futher political reaction.Beaudry and his collaborators do not say how long they think these post-2000 trends will continue to shape employment opportunity. Unforeseen technological advances could once again produce high-end employment seen in earlier periods of intense technological innovation, but Beaudry, Green and Sand are not optimistic.The decline of opportunities for the college-educated may, paradoxically, offer those on the economic left a glimmer of hope. College graduates stuck in an employment trough are, in many cases, the children of the upscale Democratic elite \u2013 a constituency historically more concerned with social and cultural issues than economic ones.This cohort is often more sympathetic to the problems of educated professionals than those of day laborers. If their children begin to face hurdles similar (although of course hardly identical) to those confronting manual and semi-skilled workers, interest in a more activist government may grow even as the question arises: Can policies be developed to counter adverse employment trends?Gordon\u2019s prognosis is perhaps the bleakest: \u201cThe future of American economic growth is dismal, and policy solutions are elusive.\u201dMost optimistic of all are Brynjolfsson and McAfee, who argue that \u201cthe transformations brought about by digital technology will be profoundly beneficial ones. We\u2019re heading into an era that won\u2019t be just different; it will be better.\u201dBased on the evidence so far, though, this better era has yet to materialize. For now, pessimists appear to be carrying the day. It remains unclear when, or even if, that will change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Gas Cache, Now Under Shaky Ground", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA gas production facility operated by\u00a0Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij or NAM, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil in Groningen Province in the Netherlands.LOPPERSUM, the Netherlands \u2014 Deep below the cow pastures and farming villages in this picturesque northeastern corner of the Netherlands lies an extraordinary resource: Europe\u2019s largest source of natural gas, known as the Groningen gas field.Since its discovery in Groningen Province in 1959, the field has powered the economy of the Netherlands and has been a reliable supply of gas for Northern Europe. Five decades and counting is a remarkable run of productivity for a field of fossil fuel.But as it enters old age, Groningen has grown cranky.A half-century of extraction has reduced the field\u2019s natural pressure in recent years, and seismic shifts from geological settling have set off increasingly frequent earthquakes \u2014 more than 120 last year, and at least 40 this year. Though most of the tremors have been small, and resulted in no reported deaths or serious injuries, they have caused widespread damage to buildings, endangered nearby dikes and frightened and angered local residents.In light of those problems, the Dutch government is now demanding that the field\u2019s operator, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil, curtail production, making the Groningen field much more than a local worry.The field accounts for about one-third of the natural gas produced in the European Union. Any reduction in Groningen\u2019s output might be especially hard for the European economy to bear now that tension in Ukraine is making the receipt of gas from Russia uncertain and as Moscow pivots its energy attention toward China. \u201cGroningen is one of the few facilities able to swing up in terms of production when demand rises,\u201d said Jonathan Stern, chairman of the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. He and other analysts say the cuts could influence gas supplies and prices in Europe in the event of a tight market this year. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this will affect us in a cold winter,\u201d Mr. Stern said.People living atop the Groningen field are trying to cope with the on-the-ground consequences.Nienke Pastoor and her husband, Jaap, spent years restoring a 110-year-old farmhouse. But an earthquake in 2012 left cracks in the outer brick walls and inflicted more serious structural damage to the home of Mr. Pastoor\u2019s parents across the road, causing them to suspend plans to swap homes so the younger couple would be closer to the family farmland.\u201cI have four children,\u201d Mrs. Pastoor said. \u201cIf they go to sleep and it starts to shake, what is going to happen?\u201dThe Groningen field was developed with traditional drilling techniques. But the geological problems posed even by a conventional gas field could provide additional fodder for critics of hydraulic fracturing technique, or fracking, which is being used elsewhere to extract gas from shale rock and has been known to cause minor earthquakes in Britain.As part of a three-year test, the Dutch government has ordered the joint venture that operates the Groningen field, Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, or NAM, to cut production by about 20 percent from last year\u2019s level. It has also demanded other corrective measures, including reinvesting some of the profit from the field into the local economy. About 150,000 people live above the field, which occupies about 900 square kilometers, or 350 square miles.In a delicate balancing act, the government is taking those steps to avoid curbing output even more at Groningen, where production was already expected to start declining steeply in the next decade. The field contributes as much as 12 billion euros, or $16.4 billion, to the national government each year, or more than 4 percent of its revenue. Shell and Exxon do not disclose their profits from Groningen, but the companies are thought to split around \u20ac1 billion a year in earnings from the field.Despite the government action, many local people are skeptical that anything will really change.\u201cThe main question is, Can you rebuild trust?\u201d said Jacques Wallage, a former member of the Dutch cabinet and a former mayor of Groningen who is co-chairman of an effort to create a dialogue between the gas company and local citizens\u2019 groups. \u201cNAM has spoiled trust over the last 20 to 30 years.\u201dJan Willem Jacobs, NAM\u2019s project director for the Groningen field, made clear during an interview that the company accepted responsibility for the earthquakes and for fixing the damage they caused.Still, \u201cit is a very unpleasant problem that I would rather not have,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said in NAM\u2019s hulking white-stone headquarters in Assen, a town about a half-hour drive south of Groningen.For much of Groningen\u2019s first 50 years, the field was so prolific that it required little additional drilling after the initial development. The 20 or so production centers scattered about the countryside \u2014 arrays of pipes and metal vessels \u2014 are partly hidden by trees, and for decades quietly did their work with little direct human intervention, sending the extracted gas into the national pipeline network and points beyond.Then came the earthquakes, beginning in the early 1990s, with an increase in frequency and intensity ever since. In August 2012, a seismic threshold was crossed when a quake with a magnitude of 3.6, the largest so far, frightened residents and caused widespread damage but no casualties.\u201cAt that time, the region awoke to the real danger for this area,\u201d said Albert Rodenboog, the mayor of Loppersum, who has helped coordinate efforts urging the national government and NAM to take action.The gas is trapped in porous sandstone deep beneath the ground. When the fuel flows to the surface, the rock contracts like a squeezed sponge. In some places in the Groningen area, this contraction has caused the surface of what is already a low-lying area drained by numerous canals to sink as much as 35 centimeters, or nearly 14 inches. That has caused NAM to invest heavily in new water pumping stations and other water management systems.After the 2012 quake, scientists at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute raised their estimate of how big an earthquake was possible from the field to a magnitude of 5, or more than 30 times the energy of their previous top-end forecasts.Even that would still be relatively small, compared with the 8.9-magnitude quake that caused the devastating tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011. But the Groningen tremors have been occurring relatively near the earth\u2019s surface \u2014 about 3,000 meters, or 1.9 miles, deep \u2014 which magnifies the impact, said Bernard Dost, director of the meteorological institute\u2019s seismology division. And because Groningen was not previously subject to earthquakes, he said, buildings in the region were not designed to withstand them.During the three-year test, NAM will hold overall output to about 80 percent of what was produced in 2013. Even with the cutback, Groningen will remain a large producer. The new annual production ceiling, at 42.5 billion cubic meters, would still be higher than the 38 billion cubic meters a year that Russia recently agreed to supply to China.But the Dutch government is placing Groningen\u2019s most accessible gas further out of reach. It has ordered the company to sharply curtail production at five sites in the Loppersum area, which has been the epicenter of the quakes. Mr. Jacobs, the NAM project director, says those sites are in Groningen\u2019s \u201csweet spot\u201d \u2014 its most prolific zones for gas extraction.The company and various government authorities have also agreed on a five-year, \u20ac1.2 billion package to repair and reinforce homes and other buildings, including more than 20 of the medieval churches in the region that have sustained substantial damage.The government says the construction work will create 3,000 jobs in the region. Some of the money is also to be spent on bolstering the rural electrical and telecommunications grids and to help compensate homeowners who have had to sell at depressed prices because of earthquake-related problems.The hope is to win over locals. The field has never been a big source of jobs, and the local governments have never received any special tax revenue before.Groningen residents say NAM\u2019s biggest challenge may be in repairing community relations.\u201cWhat a lot of people fear is that their whole surroundings will die,\u201d said Daniella Blanken, secretary of the 2,000-member citizens group Groninger Bodem Beweging, or Groningen Earth Movement.Ms. Blanken\u2019s organization would like to see gas production at Groningen cut by about 40 percent, and wants independent monitoring of the company. \u201cPeople don\u2019t consider NAM a neighbor,\u201d she said. \u201cThey consider it an intruder.\u201dMr. Dost, the seismologist, said that lowering production in the epicenter will probably reduce the earthquake risk, but only time will tell. \u201cWe should see over the next one to two years,\u201d he said.It is a test that residents say Groningen cannot afford to fail. \u201cIf there is one casualty, everything is different here,\u201d Ms. Blanken said. \u201cOne casualty is going to put the region on fire.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Lure Bostonians, New \u2018Pop-Up\u2019 Bus Service Learns Riders\u2019 Rhythms", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBROOKLINE, Mass. \u2014 Katie Pasciucco, 34, an account manager at a software company, is a typical Boston commuter. Her door-to-door trip to work is just 4.5 miles but takes at least 50 maddening minutes.With no predictable subway schedule available, she usually waits several minutes for a train. It makes numerous stops before she gets off, and then she still has to walk 20 minutes.And so she leapt at the chance this week to travel a new way \u2014 by old-fashioned bus.Also in the mix is the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which operates the region\u2019s bus and subway system, known as the T. It has just started late-night T service on weekends to meet the growing demand of Boston\u2019s large college crowd, odd-hour technology workers and late-night service workers in bars and restaurants.\u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild, Wild West right now,\u201d said Donna Blythe-Shaw, a spokeswoman for the Boston Taxi Drivers Association. \u201cThe T, taxis, Uber, Lyft \u2014 have smart app, will travel.\u201d She predicted that Bridj would have \u201csome impact,\u201d but said it was too soon to say how much.The transportation authority sees Bridj at this fledgling stage as a complement to the T. \u201cThis is not a competitive situation at all,\u201d said Joseph Pesaturo, the authority spokesman.Yet he was quick to note that the city bus fare of $1.50 and subway fare of $2 are much less than Bridj\u2019s $6. And the city buses now have real-time smartphone apps that alert riders to arrival times.But most of those who lined up on Monday for Bridj\u2019s first day of beta service, which was free, said that problems with the T had prompted them to try Bridj.\u201cI\u2019m tired of getting crammed in like a sardine on the train,\u201d said J. P. Nahmias, a co-worker of Ms. Pasciucco\u2019s.Eva Zhou, a biotech worker, said, \u201cThere\u2019s never an easy ride on the T, and it\u2019s always crowded.\u201d As for Bridj\u2019s higher fare, she thought the service might qualify for her company\u2019s stipend for employees who use alternative transportation.On Bridj\u2019s two maiden trips Monday morning, from Brookline to Boston\u2019s financial district and to Kendall Square in Cambridge, the nonstop buses arrived more quickly than the subway.For Ms. Pasciucco, Bridj shaved 10 minutes off her door-to-door commute. But what she appreciated most was the predictable schedule, allowing her to waste less time and arrive feeling less frazzled.The brainchild of Matthew George, a 23-year-old entrepreneur, Bridj uses algorithms to make the bus routes \u201csmarter.\u201d As more people use it, it will adjust the routes accordingly.Bridj collects millions of bits of data about people\u2019s commutes from Google Earth, Facebook, Foursquare, Twitter, LinkedIn, the census, municipal records and other sources.\u201cWe crunch these millions and millions of data points through a number of algorithms that are existing, or that we\u2019re refining, to tell us where people are living and working,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cAnd through our special sauce, we\u2019re able to determine how a city moves.\u201dThe system will become so smart, he said, that eventually it will take more people closer to their destinations. He will then swap out the 54-seat motor coaches he now leases for more efficient, smaller vehicles as Bridj expands its routes. Someday, he said, those vans could use automated vehicle technology \u2014 becoming driverless vehicles that avoid collisions, get better fuel economy and speed up traffic flow. And this, he said, will help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.Although similar technology-driven systems are being tested elsewhere, Bridj claims to be able to apply its data faster to create new routes more quickly.His track record with BreakShuttle helped win investors for Bridj. His primary financial backer is Jill Preotle of Boston, an early investor in Zipcar, who said she was drawn to Bridj for its potential, like that of Zipcar, to reduce car ownership and therefore reduce traffic and pollution.Mr. George is in talks to start Bridj in several other cities, which he declined to identify, by the end of summer. He is also preparing a plan to serve office parks on Route 128, the famous \u201ctechnology highway\u201d northwest of Boston, where thousands of commuters clog the roads in a bumper-to-bumper standstill.But while Bridj can help incrementally, Mr. Weisbrod said, it cannot solve the fundamental transportation problems of big cities. \u201cBuses can only do so much,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t eliminate the need for public investment in large-scale transit systems.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Leader Fights Graft, His Relatives Shed Assets", "Date": "2014-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 As President Xi Jinping of China prepares to tackle what may be the biggest cases of official corruption in more than six decades of Communist Party rule, new evidence suggests that he has been pushing his own family to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in investments, reducing his own political vulnerability.They did it \u201cfor the family,\u201d Mr. Xiao\u2019s spokeswoman said in a statement.No investment stakes have been tied directly to Mr. Xi or his wife and daughter. But the extensive business activities of his sister and brother-in-law are part of a widespread pattern among relatives of the Politburo elite, who have built up considerable fortunes by trading on their family\u2019s political standing.After taking power, Mr. Xi vowed to do battle with the \u201ctigers and flies\u201d \u2014 senior and petty officials engaged in corrupt or unseemly business activities \u2014 to shore up the party\u2019s credibility. But there are doubts that he could carry out a wholesale crackdown on financial dealings by ruling families, who are deeply enmeshed in the state-driven business culture of the country.Records show Ms. Qi; her husband, Mr. Deng; and her daughter Zhang Yannan still hold tens of millions of dollars in company shares and real estate, including a villa overlooking Hong Kong\u2019s exclusive Repulse Bay. It is also unclear whether the price paid to them for the investments they did sell resulted in a profit or a loss \u2014 meaning it is not clear if Mr. Xi\u2019s order to exit investments amounted to a hardship for his relatives.Ding Xueliang, a professor of politics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said party and government officials had told him on a recent trip he took to mainland China that Mr. Xi had told his family to get out of their investments.\u201cIt is a minimum thing \u2014 he must do this,\u201d Mr. Ding said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t do this, it is very hard for him to convince other families to be more self-disciplined.\u201dThe elite ruling families of China have accumulated billions of dollars in assets, including company shares and real estate, in the past decade as China\u2019s economy has boomed. Many of the investments are in areas such as mining, infrastructure and property that involve the privatization of formerly state-owned assets, including a rare-earth mining company that until recently was partly owned by Mr. Deng.At least four families among the nine-man Politburo Standing Committee that ruled the country from 2007 to 2012 each owned or controlled documented assets in excess of $150 million, including relatives of Mr. Xi, former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, Mr. Zhou and Jia Qinglin, the former fourth-ranked party member.That accumulation of wealth has led to calls for officials to disclose their assets amid surging income inequality that is among the highest in the world and far greater than in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan: neighbors that, unlike China, do not have Communist roots.Ms. Qi, who uses her mother\u2019s last name and also goes by the name Qi Lianxin, and her husband began selling off assets owned by their principal Beijing holding company, the Qinchuan Dadi Investment Company, in late 2012, records filed with the country\u2019s State Administration of Industry and Commerce show. Qinchuan was set up in the weeks after Mr. Xi ascended to the Politburo Standing Committee in 2007 with $2.7 million in investments, ballooning to $156 million four years later.At least eight of the 11 investments that Qinchuan disclosed at the end of 2011 are no longer owned by the company, records show.Luo Zhehong, a property and mining executive from Zhejiang Province in eastern China, where Mr. Xi served as the top official from 2002 to 2007, owned a mining company with Qinchuan in Qinghai Province in western China. Records show that he acquired Qinchuan\u2019s 35 percent stake and also bought out its share in a Beijing investment company.Mr. Shi and Mr. Luo were not available to comment. Ms. Qi and Mr. Deng did not respond to faxed questions asking about their investments.Shareholders of the company \u201cvoluntarily quit their legitimately operated business which they worked very hard to found, costing them their input or bringing them a huge loss,\u201d Mr. Xiao said through a spokeswoman.Mr. Deng, through a Shanghai holding company, also owned more than one-sixth of a rare-earth mining company in the Jiangxi Province of eastern China that last year reported owning assets of about $2.1 billion. Records show that he is no longer a shareholder in the Shanghai company, and even if he were, it no longer owns a stake in the mining company.In April, that stake was taken over by a state-owned aviation investment company. Rare earths go into critical components in electric cars and wind turbines.Ms. Qi, her daughter Ms. Zhang and Mr. Deng still own many companies across China, stretching from Hainan in the south to Beijing in the north. Records examined this month show the couple still owns their Shenzhen-based investment company, Yuanwei, which holds tens of millions of dollars in assets.Ms. Zhang also remains the owner of a spacious villa in Hong Kong that records show she bought in early 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis, for $19.3 million. Since then, prices have appreciated significantly.And the couple did not sell three of its most valuable assets held by Qinchuan, including two infrastructure companies in the city of Xiangyang in Hubei Province. The three assets are together worth at least $234 million.But on Oct. 8, after no changes in its shareholding structure for almost six years, ownership of Qinchuan itself was transferred out of the family and into the hands of a longtime business associate, Xu Zaisheng, documents filed with the Chinese government show.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambodia's Subservient Judiciary", "Date": "2014-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Cambodian National Assembly passed new laws last month governing the composition and organization of the nation\u2019s courts. The net effect is to ratify and reinforce Prime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s control over the judiciary. This is in violation of Cambodia\u2019s Constitution, which calls for a separation of powers and an independent judiciary. The laws empower the minister of justice to oversee the administration of the judicial system and to appoint and discipline judges \u2014 which, as a practical matter, means he can determine the outcome in politically sensitive cases. This formalizes the de facto control over the courts Mr. Hun Sen has wielded during almost 30 years in power. All along, the courts have been politicized, ineffective and corrupt.Mr. Hun Sen came to power following the defeat of the murderous rule of the Khmer Rouge, which led to the deaths of anywhere between 1.5 million and 3 million Cambodians by execution, starvation or disease. He enjoyed popular support for the peace he brought, but that popularity has been waning. His Cambodian People\u2019s Party won by only a narrow margin in the parliamentary elections last July, elections that, according to his opposition and independent observers, were riddled with irregularities. The opposition has since boycotted Parliament. Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s latest assertion of authority over the judiciary is an inappropriate and desperate response to rising dissent.Various indexes measuring corruption, freedom and quality of life place Cambodia near the bottom of international rankings. There is great inequality in the distribution of wealth. Over a third of the children, for instance, are malnourished, and government critics are rounded up and detained on dubious charges. It does not have to be this way. Cambodia\u2019s economy has one of the highest growth rates in Asia, climbing an average of over 7 percent between 2001 and 2010, propelled largely by foreign aid and investment, and tourism. The problem is a kleptocratic government\u2019s hoarding of ill-gained wealth. Because foreign aid and investment accounts for much of the growth, the international community has considerable leverage to push for change in Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s governance. Cambodians deserve a government of all Cambodians. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Killings in Iraq, at 799, Reach a Monthly High", "Date": "2014-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAGHDAD \u2014 Violence claimed the lives of 799 Iraqis in May, the highest monthly death toll so far this year, the United Nations said Sunday, underlining the daunting challenges the Iraqi government faces as it struggles to contain a surge in sectarian violence.The figures issued by the United Nations mission to Iraq put last month\u2019s civilian death toll at 603, with 196 members of security forces killed. The mission added that 1,409 Iraqis, including 1,108 civilians, were wounded. The previous month\u2019s death toll stood at 750, making April the second deadliest month of the year.Despite the constant militant attacks that have left a vital oil pipeline idle, Iraq\u2019s crude oil exports increased slightly in May, the Oil Ministry said Sunday. The worst-hit city was the capital, Baghdad, with 315 people killed. The northern province of Nineveh came in second with 113, followed by nearby Salahuddin Province with 94.The figures exclude deaths in Anbar Province, where militants have controlled parts of the provincial capital, Ramadi, and nearby Falluja since December.The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a powerful affiliate of Al Qaeda that also operates in neighboring Syria, has intensified its attacks across Iraq as political rivals work to form a new government after parliamentary elections on April 30.Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\u2019s bloc emerged as the biggest winner, securing 92 seats in the 328-member Parliament, but it failed to gain the majority needed to govern alone.\u201cI strongly deplore the sustained level of violence and terrorist acts that continues rocking the country,\u201d the United Nations special representative in Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, said in a statement.\u201cI urge the political leaders to work swiftly for the formation of an inclusive government within the constitutionally mandated time frame and focus on a substantive solution to the situation in Anbar,\u201d he said.Last year, the death toll climbed to its highest levels since the worst of the sectarian strife in 2006 and 2007, when the country was on the brink of civil war. The United Nations says 8,868 people were killed in 2013.The 2011 withdrawal of American forces, which for eight years had often acted as a buffer between Shiites and Sunnis, is thought to have contributed to the rise in violence, in addition to the use of deadly force by the Shiite-led security forces against Sunni protesters.The violence is a constant threat to disrupt Iraq\u2019s economy, but the country\u2019s oil exports averaged 2.6 million barrels a day last month, an increase from the 2.5 million barrels per day in April, said a ministry spokesman, Assem Jihad. Mr. Jihad said the sales grossed about $8 billion monthly, based on an average price of $100.08 per barrel. April\u2019s revenues stood at about $7.6 billion.He added that all the oil was exported through the country\u2019s facilities on the Persian Gulf because the pipeline that goes to Turkey\u2019s Mediterranean port of Ceyhan has been idle since March as a result of terrorist attacks. The pipeline, which pumps 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day and traverses the restive Sunni-dominated areas of northern Iraq, has been a favorite target for militants.Iraq holds the world\u2019s fourth largest oil reserves, about 143 billion barrels. Insurgent attacks, infrastructure bottlenecks and disputes with the northern self-ruled Kurdish region over rights to develop natural resources have been the main obstacles to Iraq\u2019s increasing oil production and exports.In 2009, the Kurds contributed oil officially for the first time through a Baghdad-controlled pipeline, but shipments were interrupted many times over payment disputes. Last month, the dispute took a new turn when the region decided to unilaterally export oil through an independent pipeline.Iraq has been struggling to develop its oil and gas sectors since the American-led invasion in 2003, when the deteriorating security situation scared many investors away.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Tries to Remake the Idea Machine", "Date": "2014-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyLike any supersecret lab that\u2019s supposedly trying to invent the future, Google X looks rather nondescript from the street. Besides the occasional hot pink driverless car parked out front, the facility is an archipelago of unmarked, low-slung, redbrick buildings, more Sunset Park than Silicon Valley. Inside, however, whiteboards offer clues about what exactly the future \u2014 at least as Google sees it \u2014 might look like. And while some diagrams \u2014 including one with parts labeled \u201csnooze\u201d and \u201cset time\u201d \u2014 suggest more mundane inventions, others, like one outlining a \u201cspace elevator,\u201d seem a bit more ambitious.Silicon Valley, where toddler-aged companies regularly sell for billions, may be the most vibrant sector of the U.S. economy, fueling a boom in markets from housing to high-end toast (how many $4-a-slice artisanal bread bars does a place really need?). But as recent innovations \u2014 apps that summon cabs, say, or algorithms that make people click on ads \u2014 have been less than world-changing, there is a fear that the idea machine is slowing down. And while Silicon Valley mythology may suggest that modern-day innovation happens in garages and college dorm rooms, its own foundations were laid, in large part, through government research. But during the recession, government funding began to dwindle. The federal government now spends $126 billion a year on R. and D., according to the National Science Foundation. (It\u2019s pocket change compared with the $267 billion that the private sector spends.) Asian economies now account for 34 percent of global spending; America\u2019s share is 30 percent.Perhaps more crucial, the invention of much of the stuff that really created jobs and energized the economy \u2014 the Internet, the mouse, smartphones, among countless other ideas \u2014 was institutionalized. Old-fashioned innovation factories, like Xerox PARC and Bell Labs, were financed by large companies and operated under the premise that scientists should be given large budgets, a supercomputer or two and plenty of time to make discoveries and work out the kinks of their quixotic creations. Back then, after all, Xerox and AT&T, their parent companies, made so much money that few shareholders cared about the cost. \u201cIt\u2019s the unique ingredient of the U.S. business model \u2014 not just smart scientists in universities, but a critical mass of very smart scientists working in the neighborhood of commercial businesses,\u201d says Adrian Slywotzky, a partner at Oliver Wyman, the global management consulting firm. \u201cThen that investment was cut way back.\u201d By the \u201980s, AT&T was being taken apart by the government; Xerox PARC, like other labs, was diminished by impatient shareholders and, in some cases, the very technology it helped create.Most of the insurgent tech companies, with their razor focus on advancing the Internet, were too preoccupied to set up their own innovation labs. They didn\u2019t have much of an incentive either. Start-ups became so cheap to create \u2014 founders can just rent space in the cloud from Amazon instead of buying servers and buildings to house them \u2014 that it became easier and more efficient for big companies to simply buy new ideas rather than coming up with the framework for inventing them. Some of Google\u2019s largest businesses, like Android and Maps, were acquired. \u201cM. and A. is the new R. and D.\u201d became a popular catchphrase.But in the past few years, the thinking has changed, and tech companies have begun looking to the past for answers. In 2010, Google opened Google X, where it is building driverless cars, Internet-connected glasses, balloons that deliver the Internet and other things straight out of science fiction. Microsoft Research just announced the opening of a skunk-works group called Special Projects. Even Bell Labs announced this month that it is trying to return to its original mission by finding far-out ways to solve real-world problems.All of their parent companies, however, are determined to learn from the mistakes that Xerox and AT&T made, namely failing to capitalize on their own research. It\u2019s Valley lore, after all, that companies like Apple and Fairchild Semiconductor built their fame and fortune on research done at Xerox and Bell. Instead of focusing on basic science research, \u201cwe\u2019re tackling projects that advance science and solve significant problems,\u201d says Regina Dugan, the former director of the\u00a0Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), who now runs a small group inside Google called Advanced Technology and Projects. \u201cWhat this means is you\u2019re not compromising this idea of doing really important and interesting science and this sense of it really mattering.\u201d To put a finer point on it, Astro Teller, who oversees Google X, told me: \u201cWe are not a research center. We think of ourselves as a moonshot factory, and the reasons for using that phrase is the word \u2018moonshot\u2019 reminds us to be audacious, and the word \u2018factory\u2019 reminds us we have to industrialize it in the end.\u201dThere is a decidedly 21st-century quality to Google X. Teller dismisses the old \u201cacademics on steroids model.\u201d (He would know. One of his grandfathers, Gerard Debreu, won the Nobel Prize in economics, and the other, Edward Teller, was an early physicist on the Manhattan Project.) Instead, Google X does the inverse: It picks products to make, then hires people specifically to build them: artists and philosophers and designers, many of whom don\u2019t even know what they\u2019ll be working on until they join. (Sample job interview question: \u201cDo you like yellow?\u201d) The idea, in other words, is to recreate the institutionalized and research-predicated model of Bell Labs while also trying to get rich off it.There is worry, however, that if no major company is doing the basic science to invent new things, there will be nothing left to invent in a decade. \u201cA big part of research is just chipping away at a problem,\u201d says Peter Lee, the head of Microsoft Research, which is a more academic-minded R. and D. group. \u201cAt some point, maybe it\u2019s a decade, you suddenly pass a tipping point and completely change the world.\u201d Teller agrees but says it\u2019s not his concern: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the case that many of the projects we\u2019re working on rely on the academic work of the last 30 or 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think places like Google X should necessarily be responsible for basic research. The word \u2018basic\u2019 implies \u2018unguided,\u2019 and \u2018unguided\u2019 is probably best put in government-funded universities rather than industry.\u201d It may take decades to see who is right.A new idea, once it finds some guidance, typically travels along a path from germination to manufacturing to commercialization. The United States is good at selling stuff, but so are other countries. When Bell Labs was in its heyday, America was still very much a manufacturing nation; we made cars and steel and everything from televisions to sneakers to processed foods before sending them to consumers worldwide. Now, by and large, we make ideas. Apple\u2019s big invention wasn\u2019t making a better phone; it was coming up with the idea in the first place. Google\u2019s founders thought of a better way to search the web and created a service that no one else could replicate. Now the big Silicon Valley companies find themselves in the same vulnerable position as the incumbents whose business models they once overturned. They know it is only a matter of time before the next big idea puts them out of business \u2014 unless they are the ones to come up with it.An earlier version of this\u00a0column\u00a0misstated part of the name of\u00a0Darpa.

{"Headline": "Though Not Quietly, Kentucky Moves to Cut Reliance on Coal", "Date": "2014-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBURGIN, Ky. \u2014 The E. W. Brown power plant rides like an ocean liner on a rolling ridge in Kentucky, its smokestacks and plumes visible across fields of corn and cattle for miles around.The coal-fired plant has lighted homes since Dwight D. Eisenhower was in office. But under the Obama administration\u2019s plan to fight global warming, its days could be ticking down. Two of its three coal-fired generating units are among the oldest and least efficient in the state, and concerns that the plant could close are making residents of this small town deeply anxious.\u201cIt would completely shut Burgin down,\u201d said Ann Phillips, who with her husband, Scott, runs the Burgin Depot, a small grocery (\u201cAmerican Owned & Operated. In God We Trust. Penns Country Ham $7.99\u201d), which does 40 percent of its business with employees of the plant.Here in coal country, the reaction from politicians and the coal industry to President Obama\u2019s climate plan has been swift and close to apocalyptic.But beyond the campaign rhetoric, even here in Kentucky, which ranks No. 1 in the nation in carbon emissions per unit of electricity produced from all sources, others more quietly are saying that doom may not be at hand. In drafting its regulation, the Environmental Protection Agency listened to energy-rich states like Kentucky and offered wide flexibility to meet its requirement, the most aggressive federal effort yet to address climate change. Despite cries of a \u201cwar on coal\u201d that echo through mining country in eastern Kentucky, the region is already taking hardheaded steps toward a post-coal economy.John Lyons, Kentucky\u2019s assistant secretary for climate policy, is cautiously optimistic that the carbon limits will not raise electric prices sharply enough to drive out manufacturers, who set up in the state for rates that are among the lowest in the country.\u201cI think our electric prices are going to go up, regardless of what\u2019s done with this rule,\u201d he said.Representative John Yarmuth, a Democrat from Louisville, said Kentucky had already been moving toward a future less reliant on coal because of competition from cheaper, cleaner natural gas. In drafting its regulation, the E.P.A. endorsed a 23-page \u201cwhite paper\u201d that Kentucky\u2019s energy department sent last year asking that states be given wide flexibility in reducing carbon. Rather than regulate emissions from every smokestack, the E.P.A. is giving states an overall target to meet \u2014 in Kentucky\u2019s case, a reduction of 18 percent of carbon pollution by 2030. The target is lower than for many states, taking into account Kentucky\u2019s heavy coal habit, which accounts for 93 percent of its electricity.The state has great flexibility in devising a plan to reach the goal. It can include switching plants from coal to natural gas, developing renewable energy like solar, and encouraging the use of efficient home appliances and insulation to reduce demand. And none of it will happen immediately: Any shutdowns are years away, as the E.P.A.\u2019s proposal faces a political and legal onslaught.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be devastating if the power plant goes down,\u201d said Dionna Sizemore of Burgin, a mother of two, ages 11 and 16, who moved from Harlan County, the heart of Appalachian coal country, to escape dead-end prospects there. \u201cWe know the impact it\u2019s having on friends and family back home: people having to move off.\u201dMr. Lyons said it was impossible to say this early which of the state\u2019s 56 coal-fired generating units, if any, might close. Many have already installed costly upgrades to comply with earlier pollution rules.But Laura Sheehan, a spokeswoman for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group, said about 15 of the state\u2019s oldest and smallest units were at risk of being shut down because of the new carbon rule. Synapse Energy Economics, a research company based in Boston, identified the two older units at the E. W. Brown plant as \u201cuneconomic\u201d based on the estimated cost of complying with projected caps on carbon.A spokeswoman for the plant\u2019s owner, Kentucky Utilities Company, said it had no plans to retire the units, which opened in 1957 and 1963 and have a combined capacity of about 270 megawatts. Along with a third, newer coal-burning unit, the plant consumes 1.5 million tons of coal annually, which arrives on railroad cars that thunder through Burgin.Nationwide, the E.P.A. projects that as much as 19 percent of electricity from the country\u2019s 600 coal-fired plants will be uneconomical under the carbon regulation by 2020.Such estimates are what send critics to the barricades, warning of steep increases in electric rates and steep job losses. With electricity in Kentucky priced around 7 cents per kilowatt-hour (compared with 16 cents in New York), the state has attracted energy-intensive industries like aluminum and steel.There are no studies yet of the impact of the E.P.A.\u2019s proposal on the state\u2019s economy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation\u2019s largest business lobby, projected 21,400 job losses annually in a four-state region that includes Kentucky. But the study was based on deeper carbon reductions than the E.P.A. proposed.The agency says that nationwide, electric bills will rise in the short run by 3.2 percent, but will decline by 8 percent by 2030, as a result of increased energy efficiency. It also says reducing carbon pollution from power plants, the nation\u2019s leading source of emissions linked to global warming, will save money and create jobs.Jobs in coal mining are another story. Bill Bissett, the president of the Kentucky Coal Association, called the E.P.A. proposal \u201cvery bad news for states like Kentucky who mine and use coal to create electricity.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. McConnell introduced the Coal Country Protection Act, which would require the administration to prove that no jobs would be lost and that electric rates would not rise before the E.P.A. rule could take effect. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, blocked it.In truth, coal jobs have been declining in central Appalachia since the 1980s for a variety of reasons. They include competition from natural gas and cheaper coal from Wyoming that is easier to dig out of the ground, as well as earlier environmental regulations under Mr. Obama.Last year, they held a bipartisan conference in Pikeville, Ky., on developing a post-coal economy. Mr. Rogers favors running high-capacity, high-speed Internet cable into rural areas, which has already created thousands of jobs in digital record keeping, like those at a State Department visa processing center in Williamsburg, Ky., that uses facial-recognition technology. \u201cWe could make some great progress,\u201d Mr. Rogers said.He did not minimize the impact of the carbon emissions rule, which he called devastating. But he pointed out that coal jobs had been in decline for decades.\u201cWe have no choice but to find additional ways to make a living,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Frog, a Prince Awaits", "Date": "2014-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel13 PhotosIf a building contractor arrived on time, performed heroically and charged a fair price \u2014 this is a New York fantasy, stay with me \u2014 would you complain that he wasn\u2019t good-looking? Would you refuse to hire him if he didn\u2019t come with a fashionable tool belt?That disconnect between looks and performance sums up the Honda Fit, which has been variously described as dorky, frumpy, a doorstop and \u2014 cover the children\u2019s ears \u2014 a minivan. But don\u2019t feel sorry for the Fit. By exceeding customer expectations for a budget-friendly subcompact, Honda\u2019s hatchback has forged a near-consensus as the one that most deserves your business.To keep it that way, Honda has redesigned the Fit for 2015. The new car is more powerful, yet consumes less fuel. It\u2019s a smidgen shorter on the outside, yet carves out even more passenger space from an already efficient cabin. Honda says it has added some $1,000 to $1,800 of features to the 2015 model, while keeping the price virtually the same.That sounds like a recipe for continued success, even if Honda\u2019s chefs are serving up a Mexican dish. Fits sold in the United States are now coming from an assembly plant in Celaya, Mexico. The move is saving Honda money, and that is reflected in its hold-the-line pricing: $16,315 to start for the Fit LX with a 6-speed manual transmission, just $100 more than the 2013 version, the last model offered.The move may also help Honda sell more of the cars: American demand had sometimes outstripped supply, with a single Japanese plant having to meet global demand for the Fit (or the Honda Jazz, as it\u2019s called overseas).The midprice EX is likely to continue to be the most popular version, starting at $18,225. As with the LX, an extra $800 buys Honda\u2019s latest fuel-saver, a continuously variable automatic transmission. A 6-speed manual is offered, replacing the previous 5-speed unit.I tested a Fit EX-L, a new leather-clad $20,590 version; an optional navigation system lifted the sticker price to $21,590.More than ever, the Fit is ridiculously well suited to city living. It seats four adults, swallows plenty of gear, parks almost anywhere, sips fuel, has excellent outward visibility, dices traffic and loves to get out of Dodge for weekend adventures.The redesigned model still won\u2019t win beauty prizes \u2014 the Ford Fiesta, Hyundai Accent and Chevrolet Sonic are all more attractive, in my book \u2014 but the Fit does look more attractive than before.Slimmed-down horizontal headlamps flow naturally into a new gloss-black grille, rather than being shoved awkwardly up the stubby hood. High-rise LED taillamps frame the hatch. A concave slash of metal runs along the doors, as though a sharp talon had raked the sides.The new version is 1.6 inches shorter than the previous model over all. But because partly of a wheelbase 1.2 inches longer, the Honda adds an eye-opening 4.8 inches of additional rear legroom, giving it more than the midsize Honda Accord. Even six-foot-plus adults will have few complaints back there. The trade-off is 8 percent less hatch space when the rear seat is down. Still, the Fit holds nearly 53 cubic feet of goods when the back seat is folded, on par with some small S.U.V.s.That enormous hold is aided by Honda\u2019s split-folding Magic Seat; its one-touch operation pivots the rear seat cushions forward to create a fully flat cargo floor. The secret to that abracadabra packaging is a flat fuel tank under the floor beneath the front seats, rather than the conventional placement toward the rear. For anyone apprehensive about sitting atop the fuel supply, Honda says the tank is as impervious to crash damage as any rear-mounted unit.In recent Honda fashion, the interior styling is somewhat nondescript, especially for a car aimed at young and first-time buyers. The gauges wouldn\u2019t look out of place in, well, a minivan.But the fit and finish seem excellent for the price, with softer, richer materials replacing hard plastics. And the Fit ladles on features: All models get Bluetooth connections and a backup camera. My EX-L test car also had heated front seats, a moonroof, push-button start and LaneWatch, which presents a high-resolution camera image of the car\u2019s right-hand blind spot.But if the Fit\u2019s sophisticated performance and packaging are enough to counter any doubts about the styling, there\u2019s no free pass for Honda\u2019s audio and navigation interfaces, which have degenerated into some of the industry\u2019s most overengineered, underwhelming units.The new Display Audio screen does some things well. Like a smartphone, it responds to finger gestures like pinch-and-spread to zoom in or out. Through HondaLink, the central screen can manage iPhone apps, including travel, weather, Aha, Pandora or a phone-based navigation system. (Android compatibility is coming, but Honda can\u2019t say when.)But those screen controls are mainly tiny slivers and tinier icons that proved maddeningly difficult to pin down in a moving, bouncing car. Worse, the volume knob has been replaced by obtuse flush-mounted switches.Using the system was such a sad exercise in coordination and spatial logic that I felt I deserved a food pellet each time I successfully pecked the screen. I resorted to anchoring a thumb and three fingers on the screen frame while using an index finger to manage the functions.Yes, there\u2019s a redundant volume switch and basic audio controls on the steering wheel, along with voice commands. But why bother to offer a touch screen that seems designed to elude your touch?The consolation is the pleasure of driving the Fit, a constant reminder of what Honda can still do very well: Making Everyman cars that feel like more expensive machines.The new chassis is lighter yet more rigid, and new suspension geometry and rear dampers improve the Fit\u2019s already excellent confidence and stability.Power jumps to 130 horsepower, from 117, from a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder that\u2019s been reworked with direct injection and variable valve control.While some small cars feel less confident as speeds climb, the Fit is the opposite: Straight-line stability is outstanding, even in strong crosswinds. And when the road begins to curve, the frisky Honda takes full advantage.Drivers who prize the Fit\u2019s direct steering and cheeky handling may want to amplify those qualities with the manual transmission. That\u2019s because the Fit has adopted a continuously variable transmission, or C.V.T., as the only automatic available. A C.V.T. replaces stepped gears \u2014 the familiar first, second, third and so on \u2014 with a belt-and-pulley system that operates in Drive and never shifts. Instead, as in most hybrids, the C.V.T. constantly varies the transmission ratio to maximize acceleration or fuel economy.As C.V.T.s go, Honda\u2019s is among the best. The little 4-cylinder engine doesn\u2019t rev and drone incessantly every time you pick up the pace. But there\u2019s still that feeling of engine surge-and-release as the transmission translates commands from your right foot into action.Dropping the lever into Sport mode mimics the stepped gears of a conventional automatic, but in the way that a wedding-hall band mimics the Beatles or Beyonc\u00e9.The payoff is fuel economy that rivals any nonhybrid gasoline car in America. The Fit LX, with less weight, an aerodynamic underbody and tires with low rolling resistance, jumps a full 5 m.p.g. in the city, to 33, and 6 m.p.g. on the highway, to 41, when equipped with the C.V.T., or 29/37 with the stick shift.The EX and EX-L models are rated 32/38 m.p.g. In my testing, the EX-L returned an even better 41 m.p.g. on the highway.And there you have it. The new Fit is an affordable, fun and ultraefficient hatchback, with the expected reliability and strong resale value of a Honda.Which only proves that looks aren\u2019t everything.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Economic Growth Is a Mystery. Obamacare Is the Reason.", "Date": "2014-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving With UncertaintyImagine you decide to replace the engine of a car. You have two goals: To make the car go faster, you put in a more powerful engine, say eight cylinders rather than six. But you also want to make it more fuel efficient, so you add some sophisticated new technologies to cut back on its gas guzzling.But this is untested technology, so you don\u2019t have any idea which of these changes will prove to have a greater impact. Will the car consume more fuel because it is has become more powerful? Or will the fuel efficiency improvements be effective enough that it uses less fuel despite the bigger engine. You won\u2019t find out until you take the car for a drive.And that, in a nutshell, is why we have no idea how quickly the American economy is growing this year.As it turns out, the question of which of those efforts is more successful will have an outsize impact on the overall growth rate of the economy. That was one of the big lessons from new revisions to gross domestic product data earlier this week, which showed a surprise drop in health care spending; earlier releases of the first-quarter data showed a large gain. That swing was a major reason the economy shrank at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, its worst performance in five years.But what it really shows is how the implementation of health reform is going to cloud our understanding of the economy for some time to come.In normal times, health spending is the boring part of the G.D.P. report. It almost always grows: The first-quarter contraction was only the fourth quarterly decline in the last 80 quarters (that\u2019s going back to 1994). Health spending reduced overall G.D.P. growth by only 0.16 of a percentage point. That isn\u2019t that much in the scheme of things, but it was the most the health sector had subtracted from overall growth since the start of 1982.In other words, when economy-watchers \u2014 analysts, journalists and others \u2014 parse the quarterly economic reports, health care is usually part of the boring backdrop while we focus on sexier sectors that show more volatility, like capital expenditures by businesses. (As an aside, the fact that we consider trends in business equipment spending to be sexy is a reason you may not want to invite an economics reporter to your next cocktail party).But until the dust settles from Obamacare implementation, that has changed. The uncertainty around how the health law will affect spending patterns means that we may be in a period where quarter-to-quarter volatility in economic growth is driven by the micro details of how the health insurance law is working on the ground, rather than any broad momentum (or lack thereof) in the economy.What should we be rooting for? This is an area where what is good for the country in the short run is at odds with what is good in the long run. It would be great to see a stronger recovery from the last recession, the kind of 4 or 5 percent growth that would put Americans back to work in a big way.But the United States also has the most expensive health care system in the world, without producing better health outcomes. If the nation succeeds at reducing health care costs while also getting coverage for more people, it will be a huge win for the country\u2019s long-term competitiveness. Over time, the dollars that aren\u2019t being spent on overpriced or unneeded health services can go to other stuff that makes lives better: houses, college education, restaurant meals and the like.The frustrating thing is that if that adjustment continues, it will do so while the economy is still far from full employment. That\u2019s what happened in the first quarter: Health spending fell (yay!), but nothing else rose to take its place (boo!). It implies that we need to start seeing stronger growth in everything else to achieve robust growth even as the adjustment in the health care sector plays out.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cleaning Up the Vatican", "Date": "2014-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 It looked extremely dramatic when Pope Francis fired the entire board of the Vatican\u2019s financial watchdog last week. But that was only the half of it. The seismic changes that are underway behind the scenes in Rome are even more radical than public appearances suggest. And they offer illuminating insights into the steely character of the man who likes to present himself to the world as a model of smiling humility.The body known as Rome\u2019s Financial Information Authority (F.I.A.) supervises everything from the Vatican Bank to the real estate of the Holy See, its staff salaries and even the Vatican pharmacy. Its five Italian members were due to serve until 2016 when Francis asked them to resign early \u2014 to be replaced by an international team of financial experts that includes Joseph Yuvaraj Pillay, the man who turned around the Singapore economy, and Juan Zarate, a former financial security adviser to President George W. Bush. The drastic move came after months of infighting between the old guard and the F.I.A.\u2019s director, Ren\u00e9 Br\u00fclhart, a Swiss anti-money-laundering expert, charged with cleaning up one of the world\u2019s most secretive banks, which has assets worth more than $8 billion. A former head of Liechtenstein\u2019s financial intelligence unit, he found his reforms continually frustrated by an old-boy network. He complained to the pope, who swept aside the obstacle in a single move.But there was more to it than that, as anyone would have suspected who knew the modus operandi of Jorge Mario Bergoglio when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires before he became pope. There, too, he had faced a banking scandal in which his predecessor, Cardinal Antonio Quarracino, had become embroiled in underwriting a multimillion dollar insurance deal for a family of prominent bankers who turned out to be paying all his credit card bills. When the bank went insolvent, bankers were jailed, and the Catholic Church was asked to repay huge sums it did not have, Cardinal Bergoglio called in the international accountants Arthur Andersen, closed the church bank and transferred its assets to commercial banks. He acted swiftly, decisively and transparently \u2014 on several levels at once. And that is what he has been doing for the past year with the opaque finances of the Vatican and its scandal-mired bank.He certainly needs to do so. The bank has had a highly dubious history since the 1980s when it was implicated in the collapse of Italy\u2019s largest private bank, the Banco Ambrosiano, whose chairman, Roberto Calvi, was found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London, an incident that was widely seen as a murder disguised as suicide. A warrant was issued for the arrest of the president of the Vatican Bank, Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, alleging he was an accessory to fraudulent bankruptcy, but he was never put on trial. The bank\u2019s checkered history has continued until recent times. In a 2012 report, the Council of Europe\u2019s monetary authority failed the Vatican Bank on seven of its 16 core anti-money-laundering regulations. Other banks distanced themselves from it to such an extent that in 2013 Deutsche Bank closed down the Vatican\u2019s 80 cash machines and credit card payment services. Impropriety clung to the institution like a bad smell.Quite rightly Pope Francis made reform of the Vatican Bank one of his first priorities. Within days of becoming pope he stripped the bank\u2019s five supervisory cardinals of their $42,000 annual stipend. In a sermon at a Mass for bank staff he pointedly described their organization as \u201cnecessary up to a certain point.\u201d He demanded tighter accounting, better reporting practices and enhanced internal controls. Ten months later, unhappy with progress, he dismissed all but one of the five cardinals in January. He also replaced the F.I.A.\u2019s president with an archbishop with a track record of reform within the Vatican bureaucracy.Shrewdly, as before, he has brought in outsiders. The U.S. regulatory and compliance consultants of Promontory Financial Group are combing through the bank\u2019s 19,000 accounts. They have found poor cash-flow checks, inadequate documentation, ignorance on due diligence and a system of proxies that clouds who really controls many accounts. When the clerics in charge were asked how they answered to the regulator, they replied: \u201cWe answer to God.\u201d Now they answer to Mr. Br\u00fclhart. Some 1,600 accounts have been closed so far.He has hired other external advisers. Ernst & Young is scrutinizing Vatican property holdings. KPMG is bringing its accountancy systems up to international standards. McKinsey is reforming its media operations, which include TV, radio and a newspaper. Deloitte is advising on management.But Francis wanted to address the issue at a deeper level too. Does the Catholic Church need its own bank at all? He set up a committee, which included the Harvard law professor Mary Ann Glendon, to ask more fundamental questions. It was given powers, in a letter of authority handwritten by Francis, to summon any documents and data it deemed necessary and told to report directly to the pope, bypassing the Curia, the Vatican bureaucracy. That committee issued its report last month \u2014 and explains the timing of the F.I.A. house-cleaning. And that was not all. Two of the bank\u2019s most longstanding senior officials were eased into early retirement. And a new business manager from Australia, Danny Casey, was brought in to force fiscal transparency and discipline across all Vatican departments. He will be the right-hand man of Cardinal George Pell, former archbishop of Sydney, a traditionalist but also a vocal critic of the dysfunction of the Curia under the last papacy. Cardinal Pell is head of the new Secretariat of the Economy created by Francis in February to bring financial discipline to the Vatican, where each department has been acting as an individual center of power.At one point Francis seemed set on closing the Vatican Bank, which was founded more than 70 years ago. In the 1970s, the Vatican used it to finance covert anti-Communist missions in central America. In the 1980s, Pope John Paul II used it to channel money to the Polish Solidarity movement. Now, Francis appears to have been convinced that the bank is still needed because so many bishops, priests and religious orders work in countries without secure banking systems. But the pope is adamant it must become transparent and accountable. He is considering setting up a Vatican central bank to more closely control transfers of money abroad. That would remove the possibility that the $3 billion the bank transfers each year could be used for money-laundering \u2014 though other measures will be needed to combat the abuse of accounts for Italian tax evasion. The scandal clinging to Vatican finances taints an institution that Francis famously said he wants, above all, to be \u201ca poor church, for the poor.\u201d There are many in the Vatican, wedded to a more elitist view of the church, who are unhappy at this. So far they have been unsure how to resist a pope who operates outside the old Curia channels and acts with admirable unpredictability.What helps Francis, oddly enough, is that the scandal is far from over. One of the Vatican\u2019s most senior accountants, Msgr. Nunzio Scarano, who worked for 22 years in the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, the department in charge of paying Vatican salaries and managing its property and financial portfolios, is currently under arrest, awaiting trial on corruption and money laundering charges.Nicknamed \u201cMonsignor Cinquecento\u201d after the 500-euro bills he routinely flashed in public, Monsignor Scarano owned luxury properties and expensive works of art. He has been accused by Italian magistrates of having transferred millions out of the Vatican Bank and smuggling it to Switzerland to help rich friends avoid taxes. The director of the Vatican Bank and his deputy, who were named in Italian court documents, have resigned. The court case will undoubtedly bring more explosive and embarrassing revelations.On it goes. Even the previous pope\u2019s right-hand man, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, is under investigation for using his influence to steer almost $20 million in Vatican Bank loans \u2014 money that was eventually lost \u2014 to a film company run by a friend. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s under study,\u201d Pope Francis has told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear. Maybe it could be true, but at this time nothing is definitive.\u201dOne thing, however, is definite. Pope Francis knows that he has to get a grip on the Vatican\u2019s chaotic finances. He has only just begun.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazilian President Rejects Criticism Over World Cup", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 The year was 1970. Agents of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship had arrested Dilma Rousseff, then a member of a fledgling urban guerrilla group, the Palmares Armed Revolutionary Vanguard. Inside the prison where she was being held in S\u00e3o Paulo, a debate raged among the inmates: Should they support Brazil in that year\u2019s World Cup?\u201cAt that time, many people opposed to the government initially questioned whether we would be strengthening the dictatorship by rooting for Brazil\u2019s team,\u201d Ms. Rousseff, 66, who is now Brazil\u2019s president, said in an interview here on Tuesday. \u201cI had no such dilemma.\u201dShe said resistance dissipated among the jailed guerrillas in the period leading up to Brazil\u2019s victory over Italy in the championship match, which took place in Mexico City.The survey, based on 1,003 face-to-face interviews with Brazilian adults in April, also found that two-thirds said Brazil\u2019s economy was in bad shape, and that 61 percent thought hosting the World Cup was a bad idea because it took resources away from public services, including health care and education.The glum mood, which follows an economic boom that culminated in 7.5 percent growth in 2010, has been compounded by scandals at Brazil\u2019s national oil company, Petrobras, and a multiyear slowdown in economic growth. The economy grew only 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2014, slower than the 0.4 percent expansion reported in the previous three months.Still, Ms. Rousseff, a member of the leftist Workers Party that has governed Brazil since 2003, vigorously defended her economic record in an hourlong interview at the presidential palace in the modernist capital, Bras\u00edlia. She insisted that various measures showed that life had generally improved\u00a0in Brazil. Citing antipoverty projects that have pulled millions of people into the middle class over the last decade, she said incomes for poorer Brazilians had risen well above the rate of inflation, making Brazil\u2019s progress in reducing poverty comparable to Spain\u2019s experience after the death in 1975 of the dictator Francisco Franco, which ushered in a transition to democratic government. Emphasizing that inequality had fallen in Brazil while growing in the United States and parts of Europe, Ms. Rousseff, an economist by training, spoke glowingly of the work of Thomas Piketty, the professor at the Paris School of Economics whose sweeping studies of inequality have gained widespread attention. Ms. Rousseff said that rising incomes in Brazil had created new challenges, reflected in the large demonstrations that have given way to smaller protests, often led by housing activists or anti-establishment groups. She said that many of the protesters\u2019 complaints about the poor quality of services, whether from governments or private companies, were understandable. \u201cServices grew less than income,\u201d she said, noting as an example the surging access to air travel in Brazil, which has left many travelers fatigued at the mere thought of dealing with the country\u2019s swamped airport infrastructure. Brazil\u2019s larger middle class, she said, has \u201cmore desire, more longings, more demands.\u201d \u201cThis forms an intrinsic part of the human being in the society in which we live,\u201d she said. \u201cHe obtains something, but he wants more, which is very good.\u201d Beyond the challenges her government faces before the World Cup, with security forces bracing for a possible return of large-scale protests against spending on the tournament, Ms. Rousseff said the event offered an opportunity to strengthen Brazil\u2019s position on the global stage. In other matters, Ms. Rousseff said she expected Brazil to continue raising its diplomatic and economic profile in Latin America and the Caribbean. She singled out Cuba as a country where Brazilian companies were making inroads. \u201cWe\u2019re betting much more on a policy of investment than a blockade,\u201d she said, referring to the United States\u2019 trade embargo against Cuba, which began in 1960.In one example of Brazil\u2019s strengthening ties with Cuba, the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht has carried out a $900 million upgrade of Cuba\u2019s Mariel port. Ms. Rousseff said that overhauling Cuba\u2019s economy required the application of \u201cmore market forces, not less.\u201dHelping Cuba to open its economy also reflects on Brazil\u2019s, and Ms. Rousseff\u2019s, political evolution since military rule ended here in 1985. While Brazil now has a president who was a Marxist guerrilla in her youth, it stands out among its neighbors for a law under which perpetrators of rights abuses during the dictatorship are shielded from prosecution. Brazil\u2019s highest court has upheld the amnesty law, meaning that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s torturers remain free even as commissions examine the politically motivated crimes of that era. Ms. Rousseff said that as president, she respected the law, despite her personal views. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in vindictiveness, but I also don\u2019t believe in forgiving,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of the truth,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important for Brazil to know what happened, because that will mean it won\u2019t happen again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed Appears to Have Been Wrong About Growth. Again.", "Date": "2014-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Recovery in Need of a RecoveryWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal Reserve officials, who have persistently overestimated the strength of the economic recovery, predicted last June that the economy in 2014 would finally grow more than 3 percent for the first time since the recession.The updated forecasts the Fed will publish on Wednesday are likely to reflect more modest expectations. The economy, after all, actually shrank during a wintry first quarter. High hopes are being replaced once again by disappointing data.The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee is still expected to announce another $10 billion cut in its monthly bond purchases, to $35 billion a month, in keeping with its plan to end the purchases this fall. Fed officials regard the first quarter as an aberration, and they say that this time, the economic expansion really is gaining strength.But the continuing wait for faster growth has reinforced the concern of some critics that the Fed is retreating too quickly from its stimulus campaign. Some see evidence the Fed is undermining its own forecasts by providing less support to the economy.And it has even led some Fed officials to suggest that the central bank should discount its own predictions in deciding how quickly to scale back its own efforts to encourage growth.The pattern is striking. In every year since 2008, Fed officials have steadily reduced their initial expectations for economic growth. In each year except 2012, they had still overestimated the strength of the economy in June of the forecast year.The consequences at times have been painful. Fed officials have said they did not act more strongly to stimulate the economy in the immediate aftermath of the recession because they expected the economy to rebound more quickly.Fed officials argue that unanticipated economic setbacks have contributed to their failures of foresight, including spending cuts by federal, state and local governments, the European economic crisis and, most recently, an unusually cold winter.But officials have also acknowledged that the impact of those setbacks appears to reflect an underlying weakness in the economy that they did not anticipate.Josh Bivens, director of research and policy at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said economic conditions in recent years had few precedents, making it hard to predict the pace of the recovery. Traditional models assume the Fed can restore growth by cutting interest rates, but the Fed has held interest rates near zero since late 2008, and that has proved insufficient. That has left forecasters guessing, he said.\u201cYou can definitely be sympathetic with them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just in uncharted territory.\u201dFed officials have adjusted by gradually backing away from their assumption that the economy will rebound strongly. Officials make an initial forecast two years before the beginning of a given year. Those long-range forecasts reflect their views of the economy\u2019s potential more than the conditions that are likely to prevail at that time. And for the last five years, Fed officials have steadily reduced their expectations. In 2009, they estimated that growth in 2012 would run as high as 4.8 percent. Last year, they estimated that growth in 2016 would run no higher than 3.3 percent.Tim Duy, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon and a prominent commentator on the central bank, said Fed officials had undermined their own forecasts by reducing support for the economy.\u201cAt times they\u2019ve been their own worst enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir discomfort with the general policy stance has left them looking for a way out, and the way out is to forecast stronger growth and to say, \u2018Once we see that rebound, we\u2019re going to reverse.' \u201d As a result, he said, \u201cthey end up fighting their own forecast.\u201dMr. Duy said that last year was a particularly striking example of the Fed\u2019s tendency. Officials predicted strong growth and began to talk about the need to taper the Fed\u2019s bond purchases. Interest rates rose, the housing market hiccupped, and growth once again ended up falling short of Fed officials\u2019 expectations. \u201cThe desire to get out is clouding their judgment with regard to the forecast,\u201d he said.While the unemployment rate has fallen faster than Fed officials expected, the pattern regarding the economy\u2019s overall output appears to be repeating itself this year. Fed officials projected in January 2012 that growth this year could reach 4 percent. Even at the beginning of this year, many expected that growth would finally top 3 percent.By March, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, was already acknowledging that the Fed had been a little irrationally exuberant.\u201cIncoming data since January, when our statement sounded quite an optimistic tone, were partly down due to weather and partly down because we probably overdid the optimism in January,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at a news conference.She will answer questions again on Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seizing on Cantor Defeat, Obama Faults G.O.P. at Donor Speech", "Date": "2014-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWESTON, Mass. \u2014 President Obama, addressing a small group of donors here on Wednesday night, could not help but weigh in on the dominant political issue of the day: the primary defeat of Eric Cantor, the No. 2 House Republican. \u201cMy argument about yesterday\u2019s election is not that there was too little politics, it\u2019s that there was too little conviction about what\u2019s right,\u201d he said, without ever mentioning Mr. Cantor by name.He suggested that Republicans had become victims of their own intransigence on issues like the affordability of college, a raise in the minimum wage and an overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration system. \u201cIf you think because of politics you want to maintain a status quo that is broken,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cyou don\u2019t belong in Washington.\u201dHe told the 50 or so donors at the fund-raiser that a speech he made earlier in the day to the graduating class at Worcester Technical High School illustrated the importance of maintaining a Democratic Senate in this year\u2019s midterm congressional elections.\u201cWe want a Republican Party that can function and with which we can negotiate and compromise and help move the country forward, but unfortunately, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing in Washington right now from the Republicans,\u201d Mr. Obama said.As he was shaking hands and high-fiving Worcester Tech graduates, he told the donors, \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018How could we not want to invest in these kids?\u2019\u00a0\u201dThirty to 40 percent of the school\u2019s students are \u201cdream kids,\u201d Mr. Obama said, referring to the foreign-born children of illegal immigrants. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we want to give them that certainty that you are part of the fabric of this nation,\u201d he said. And he pushed back on the notion that the defeat of Mr. Cantor \u2014 who was hammered by his opponent over any suggestion of an immigration overhaul \u2014 would doom such a push. \u201cI fundamentally reject that,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cand I will tell the speaker of the House that he needs to reject that, because if you\u2019d met those kids today, you\u2019d know that politics can\u2019t play a part in it.\u201dIt was a theme Mr. Obama embraced at the Worcester Tech graduation ceremony, where he chided congressional Republicans for blocking student loan relief legislation that he and other Democrats have championed. \u201cIt is not fair to students who do everything right to get saddled with debt that they have to pay off not just for years, but in some cases decades,\u201d Mr. Obama told the graduates.The president said it was frustrating that Republicans had thwarted legislation sponsored by Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative John F. Tierney, both Democrats from Massachusetts, that would have made it easier for students to repay their college loans.\u201cDon\u2019t boo,\u201d Mr. Obama said as the audience shouted in dismay. \u201cRemember to vote.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to keep on putting pressure on Congress,\u201d he added.The barb was part of an otherwise upbeat speech in which the president praised the school, which has transformed in less than a decade from one of the state\u2019s worst performers to among the nation\u2019s best.\u201cTogether, you\u2019re an example of what\u2019s possible when we stop just talking about giving young people opportunity, when we don\u2019t just give lip service to helping you compete in the global economy, and we actually start doing it,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI want the nation to learn from Worcester Tech.\u201dThe commencement speech \u2014 the president\u2019s only one to a high school class this spring \u2014 came during a week when Mr. Obama has tried to focus attention on his education agenda.As the backdrop for his message, the president chose a high school that has excelled despite substantial economic and educational challenges. More than 60 percent of the students at Worcester Tech qualify for free or reduced-price meals, while nearly 20 percent have special needs. Mr. Obama, introduced by the high school\u2019s Ghana-born student body president, Reginald Sarpong, told the students that they were graduating at a \u201ccynical time,\u201d\u00a0in the wake of a recession and two wars, and \u201cin a culture that so often focuses on conflict and controversy and looks at the glass half-empty instead of half-full.\u201d\u201cBut when I meet young people like you,\u201d he said, \u201cI am absolutely certain we are not just going to outcompete the rest of the world, we are going to win.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Man in Warsaw", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The surge of populists and extremists in the recent European Parliament elections can be chalked up to many things: an expression of general anti-establishment anger, fueled by an economic downturn lasting for years; resentment that European elites seem to know only one direction for the European Union \u2014 further integration \u2014 while most citizens would prefer the nation-state to remain the prime decision maker.But there is also a sense that the people running Europe are less than inspiring and seem to have been chosen not for charisma or competence, but out of political convenience.Take the presidency of the European Council, a post created five years ago with much fanfare \u2014 only to be filled by the quiet Herman Van Rompuy, a former Belgian prime minister and amateur poet chosen because he wouldn\u2019t bother European heads of state too much with his own ambition or vision. In that respect he\u2019s done a wonderful job.Or take Catherine Ashton, Europe\u2019s chief diplomat, who will step down by the end of this year. When the British politician was chosen in 2009, she didn\u2019t have any foreign policy credentials. But she was British, a member of the then-ruling Labour Party and a woman. Her performance has proved to be slightly better than her lack of expertise had suggested. But it has certainly not been remarkable.For everybody disappointed by the mediocre choice of politicians for Europe\u2019s top jobs, there now is a silver lining of hope. A few days ago the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, suggested that his foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, should succeed Ms. Ashton.Mr. Sikorski is exactly the sort of character needed to change our thinking about European political leaders: Not only is he one of the most outstanding political talents in Europe, but he is an intellectually inspiring figure whose colorful life was shaped by the tragic course of Polish history.Exiled from Poland in 1981 when martial law was declared in his country, Mr. Sikorski, still a student, was granted political asylum in Britain. He studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, where he became the head of the standing committee of the Oxford Union debating society.In the mid-1980s he went to Afghanistan as a journalist to report on the Russian invasion. \u201cThe Afghans were resisting the same alien rule as Poland; their cause was mine,\u201d he wrote in his memoir about his time there, \u201cDust of the Saints.\u201d When I asked him, some years ago, about rumors that he had taken part in the fighting, he answered with a smile. There were things he didn\u2019t even tell his family about, he said.When Mr. Sikorski became Poland\u2019s defense minister in 2005, he was largely seen as a sometimes abrasive Russia hawk. But since he became foreign minister in 2007, he has smoothed his rough edges considerably. He and Prime Minister Tusk have invested a lot of energy to improve relations with Poland\u2019s two big neighbors, Germany and Russia, despite a history of horrific treatment by both during the Nazi and Soviet occupations. His efforts on Russia faltered after Vladimir V. Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, but he has made significant strides in improving relations with Germany.Germany also was interested in improving and upgrading its ties with Poland, but Mr. Sikorski still took some unprecedented steps. In a famous 2011 speech in which he pleaded with Germany to take a more active role in the euro crisis, he made a remarkable statement for a Polish politician. \u201cI fear German power less than I am beginning to fear its inactivity,\u201d he said \u2014 a comment that surely got him in trouble with the conservative opposition back home.It is one of Mr. Sikorski\u2019s strengths that he is not the most diplomatic of diplomats, and refuses to master the art of being boring. During a 2012 speech at his beloved Oxford, he addressed in particular the conservative and largely euro-skeptical peers he had studied with and told them that it would be foolish for Britain to leave the European Union \u2014 advice his listeners would have outright scoffed at as interference in internal British affairs, had it come from anybody else but him (he had, after all, taken British citizenship in 1987, though he renounced it in 2006, after he became defense minister).Poland, like other Eastern European countries, was seen for two decades as a basket case that needed to be tended to by the European Union. But in fact Poland has long ceased to be a problem, and has become a problem solver, playing a vital diplomatic role in Europe\u2019s eastern periphery, particularly regarding Belarus or Ukraine.This week Poland celebrates 25 years since it began its transition to democracy, a reminder, if any is needed, that Poland is the brightest success story among the countries of the former East bloc. Since 2004, when Poland joined the European Union, its economy has grown on average 4 percent a year, and it has weathered the storm of the economic crisis better than most European countries. It is politically stable, too: Donald Tusk is the first prime minister since the transition to be re-elected to his post.With Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, history has come back to Europe, bringing with it a heightened sense of the Continent\u2019s vulnerability. Eastern Europeans in general, and Mr. Sikorski in particular, have been much more realistic than their Western European colleagues in assessing Russia\u2019s imperial instincts, and they are much better at reading the mind-set of Russia\u2019s rulers.But Mr. Sikorski is also a person who can bridge East and West in Europe. He is well-connected in Washington, and doesn\u2019t need to do the training on the job that Ms. Ashton did.Poland has never filled any of the top posts in Brussels. This time it should.

Cuomo\u2019s about-face on raising the minimum wage in New York has increased hopes among the city\u2019s lowest-paid workers that their pay will soon rise sharply. But despite the talk around City Hall of a minimum wage in the city as high as $15 an hour, an increase of that magnitude is probably at least a few years off, according to political and labor leaders. On Monday, Seattle became the first large city in America to approve a local minimum wage of $15 an hour, but for New York City to follow suit would be more complicated.In New York State, local governments cannot set their own minimum wages. Mr. Cuomo has said that letting them do so could lead to a \u201cchaotic situation.\u201dBut over the weekend, Mr. Cuomo said he would support the demand of the Working Families Party that municipalities with higher costs of living be allowed to set higher minimum wages \u2014 within limits. He endorsed an increase in the statewide minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and a minimum wage as much as 30 percent higher in places such as New York City, Westchester County and Nassau County. Those changes could push the city\u2019s minimum wage to $13.13, an increase of nearly two-thirds from the current statewide minimum, $8 an hour. On Tuesday, the speaker of the City Council, Melissa Mark-Viverito, broached the possibility of a minimum wage as high as $15.A spokesman for the speaker said on Wednesday that Ms. Mark-Viverito supported a minimum wage well above $10 in the city, but that she did not yet have a specific target in mind. The Council passed a resolution calling for the power to set a higher minimum wage in the city, but state lawmakers have not acted on it.With the current legislative session in Albany winding down, even the most ardent supporters of higher wages do not expect any changes before next year. Even then, passage might require that the Democrats gain control of the State Senate, an outcome Mr. Cuomo has promised to campaign for.Those changes would also face opposition from business groups that fear that a steep rise in wages would force employers to trim their payrolls.The Partnership for New York City, which represents many of the city\u2019s biggest employers, supported legislation last year that is gradually raising the state\u2019s minimum wage. But Kathryn S. Wylde, the group\u2019s chief executive, said the partnership would push for maintaining a statewide wage scheme and would want to know how any changes would affect industries with large numbers of low-wage workers, such as retailing. \u201cTo have New York City different than Long Island and different than Westchester, that is really very difficult to deal with,\u201d Ms. Wylde said. \u201cOur employers for the most part recognize that the cost of living in New York justifies a higher minimum wage, but we\u2019d like to see it consistent across the state.\u201d Ms. Wylde said the partnership would also seek exceptions for special classes of workers, such as student interns.Any increases in the minimum wage would likely be phased in, supporters said. In Seattle, the increase to $15 an hour will take as long as seven years for smaller employers and four for larger ones. \u201cAt a minimum, we\u2019re talking about four or five years\u201d before the base wage in New York City would get to $13 or more, said James Parrott, chief economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group allied with labor unions. Still, Mr. Parrott said, an increase of that size would have broad effects on incomes. He said that about 1.2 million workers in the city \u2014 more than one-third of the work force \u2014 earn less than $15 an hour. That group includes at least one of 10 workers in every sector of the economy, he said. Even in the finance, insurance and real estate industries, which are generally considered to pay well, about one-fifth of the workers make less than $15 an hour, he said.Mr. Parrott said a significant increase in the minimum wage would affect people working in \u201chotels, restaurants, neighborhood services, schools, even private schools, crossing guards, teacher aides, a fair number of people in the government sector.\u201dThough there may be no imminent legislative action to raise New York\u2019s hourly minimum wage beyond the $9 level that is scheduled to take effect at the end of 2015, the issue is not likely to fade from the political discourse. It is one of the main planks in the platform of the Working Families Party in statewide elections this year, a party spokesman said.The party sees $15 an hour as a powerful rallying cry to attract employees of fast-food restaurants and other low-wage workers to the polls this fall, he said.

{"Headline": "Immigration: What Americans Think", "Date": "2014-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPulse of the PeopleEric Cantor\u2019s defeat has resulted in great speculation about the future of immigration politics.Mr. Cantor\u2019s opponent, David Brat, repeatedly portrayed him as supporting \u201camnesty.\u201d Mr. Cantor opposed a broad immigration overhaul but favored providing a path to legal status for young undocumented immigrants. Political analysts wonder whether Congress will be even less likely to pass an immigration bill in the wake of Mr. Brat\u2019s primary win.Which leads us to a brief overview of where the public stands on immigration:National polls consistently show that a majority of Americans support allowing illegal immigrants a chance to stay in the United States.A CBS News poll in March, for instance, found that 56 percent of Americans thought that people living here without legal status should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship. An additional 12 percent thought they should be allowed to stay as legal residents, if not citizens. Twenty-nine percent of the public supported deporting them.While there is a partisan divide on several parts of the debate, majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents agree that illegal immigrants should be given a way to remain in the country legally.Majorities of Democrats and independents support a path to citizenship. The number of Republicans who support citizenship is smaller, but a combination of those Republicans supporting citizenship and another form of legal residency nonetheless makes up a majority of Republicans. In the CBS News poll, 44 percent of Republicans supported a path to citizenship, and an additional 10 percent said illegal immigrants should be able to become legal residents. Still, a sizable 42 percent of Republicans supported deportation.Even though relatively few people cite immigration as the country\u2019s most important issue, many say they could not vote for a candidate who disagrees with them on the issue. Most Americans agree with Mr. Cantor\u2019s position on illegal immigrants \u2014 that they should be allowed a path to stay legally. Hispanics, a constituency many Republicans hope to woo, overwhelmingly favor a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.Most Americans want the federal government to take steps to keep illegal immigrants from entering the country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Role for G-7 in Global Warming Battle", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Global TrendsPARIS \u2014 When the leaders of the Group of 7 meet this week in Brussels, they will have plenty on their plates, not least the crisis in Ukraine and the energy security issues it raises. If history is any guide, they will pay little more than lip service to a subject where international leadership is needed: climate change.\u201cThe G-7 should be in the lead,\u201d said Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the main international body for addressing the problem.\u201cThey should be familiarizing themselves with the long-term challenge that science is calling on us to face,\u201d Ms. Figueres added, namely holding the rise in global temperatures below the benchmark target of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201cThe fact that the United Nations climate conference has been making so little progress suggests that it makes sense to consider other institutions,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, director of the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements.The G-7 countries contribute a significant percentage of global emissions, Mr. Stavins noted, and it would be \u201ca lot easier to work out a deal\u201d with a handful of nations than with around 180 countries of the United Nations convention.Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist, said the best thing the leaders could do this week would be to cut emissions through a carbon tax or the cap-and-trade system, but that doing so was not politically feasible.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing the G-7 can do to affect the domestic U.S. climate deniers or the carbon-intensive industry lobby,\u201d said Mr. Stiglitz, who served as a lead author for the International Panel for Climate Control\u2019s 1995 report.Congress, fearing a loss of competitiveness for American corporations, has been unwilling to back any agreement that doesn\u2019t require all nations to shoulder an equal burden, he said. But China and many developing nations argue that the countries that have produced most of the man-made greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere should bear most of the cost.Considering the stalemate, he said, it would be a major step forward if the G-7 could agree on the necessity of enforcement action for whatever deal is finally reached, through trade sanctions against countries that fail to meet the limits: \u201cThey\u2019d be saying that this is a global problem and there won\u2019t be any global free riders.\u201dMohamed Adow, climate policy adviser for Christian Aid, a nonprofit development organization, said the G-7 could give the global climate negotiations \u201ca dramatic boost by living up to the spirit of the climate convention.\u201dThe group combines most of the countries \u201cwith the greatest emissions and the greatest wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they raised their pledges for emissions cuts and finance for helping the poor who desperately need it to survive, that would provide a huge injection of trust into the negotiations.\u201dJake Schmidt, international climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the most important thing the G-7 could do would be \u201cto give a clear signal\u201d that they planned to put serious emissions cuts on the table next year in Paris.\u201cIf the G-7 don\u2019t do it, how can you ask China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea to come forward with targets for the next round?\u201d he asked.Scott Barrett, a professor of natural resource economics at Columbia University, said another approach would be to act on a relatively modest objective to demonstrate that global leaders actually can cooperate on global warming.\u201cThe Montreal Protocol didn\u2019t set out to protect the climate, but it has been very successful,\u201d Mr. Barrett said.Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said by e-mail that for the G-7 to help galvanize action, it needed ultimately to embrace a positive message. \u201cIt is critical to emphasize the hope of taking action, not the despair of doing nothing,\u201d he said.\u201cWe have the technology to transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d Mr. Pachauri said, \u201cand the pathways along which we can move toward that goal. We can make that transition without imposing an unacceptable burden on the global economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Trade Gap Rises Sharply as Exports of Food Fall", "Date": "2014-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A decline in American exports and lower income from overseas investments drove the nation\u2019s current-account deficit to its highest level in 18 months.The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the deficit rose to a seasonally adjusted $111.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with a revised total of $87.3 billion in the October-to-December quarter. The fourth quarter\u2019s total was the smallest in 14 years.The current account is the country\u2019s broadest measure of trade, covering not only goods and services but also investment flows. A wider deficit can indicate lagging growth because it means American companies are earning less from their overseas markets. Rising petroleum exports have narrowed the gap in recent years, though such exports fell in the first quarter, widening the deficit.Overall exports dropped to $399.7 billion, from $407.1 billion in the previous quarter, according to the report released on Wednesday. Exports of food and feeds also fell, mostly because of a drop in soybean exports. The larger trade gap in the first quarter cut nearly a full percentage point from growth. Economists now estimate that the economy contracted at an annual pace of 2 percent in the first quarter. They expect growth to resume in the current quarter at roughly a 3.5 percent rate.Americans received $196.5 billion in income from overseas investments, compared with $198.8 billion in the previous quarter.The current-account gap is still relatively low by historical standards. It regularly topped $150 billion in the four years before the recession.Two trends have narrowed the deficit in the last four years. First, the United States has benefited from an oil and gas boom, mostly because new drilling technologies have made it feasible to drill for oil and gas in states like North Dakota, New York and Pennsylvania.That has reduced the trade deficit by increasing oil exports and lowering imports. Petroleum exports reached a record high last year, while imports dropped nearly 11 percent.Second, low American interest rates have reduced the payments foreigners receive on their holdings of Treasury bonds and other investments. And the payments Americans receive on overseas investments have risen, increasing the nation\u2019s investment surplus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayors Put Focus on How to Raise Wages for Lowest-Paid Workers in Cities", "Date": "2014-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDALLAS \u2014 About one in five people in Hallandale Beach, Fla., live below the poverty line. Though it is a small city \u2014 37,000 people, a horse track and a greyhound track \u2014 its mayor, Joy Cooper, bellied up to the table during a jobs committee discussion on Saturday among the nation\u2019s mayors and fired off a few questions about raising the minimum wage, if not for the whole city, at least for businesses with city contracts.\u201cI want to make sure my employees are cared for properly,\u201d Ms. Cooper said later. \u201cI want to have a high-quality work force.\u201dA wave of cities and states have raised their minimum wage in the absence of federal action, most notably Seattle, which this month elected to go to $15 an hour, the highest minimum wage in the country. San Francisco seems likely to do the same. New York, too, is poised to raise its minimum wage if the Legislature grants permission.He said that included Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, who is pushing a bill that would raise the state\u2019s minimum wage to $10 and allow cities to increase it even more, if they choose.Mayors here discussed a range of subjects, including net neutrality, environmental regulation, community colleges and blight. But even some of those issues were framed as a way to increase the odds of advancement for the less well-off.Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore, for example, said the city was offering tens of thousands of dollars in incentives for home buyers if they purchased a previously vacant home. Maria Shriver, the former first lady of California, also appeared, with a plea to support low-income women with services like better access to child care.Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who addressed the conference on Sunday, said: \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for help in fighting inequality out of some sense of local privilege. We\u2019re doing it because not only do we have to solve the problems of our people, we have to help this nation avert the crisis that will come if we don\u2019t address these problems and if our cities remain unsupported, since we are more and more the economic engines and core for this country.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf our federal partners or our state partners aren\u2019t acting quickly enough, we will act.\u201dMr. de Blasio will lead a new task force of mayors to address inequality and formulate an \u201curban agenda\u201d to be pursued in Washington. The group will meet at Gracie Mansion, his mayoral residence, in August. The task force is not limited to wages, and will also address issues like paying for pre-K education.At a news conference announcing the task force, Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas said, \u201cThis income disparity is costing us millions and millions and millions of dollars.\u201dSeveral mayors said that raising the minimum wage did not have momentum in their cities or was not possible. In Oklahoma City, there was a push by labor groups to raise it; the State Legislature responded by barring cities from doing so. Seventeen states have passed such laws, including Florida, according to the National Employment Law Project, while this year alone nine states have voted to increase their minimum wage.Mayor Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City said his city was attacking inequality in other ways, like using a special sales tax to rebuild or refurbish 73 aging city schools. Mr. Cornett, a rare Republican among big-city mayors, said the cost of living and unemployment were both low in Oklahoma City.\u201cThe best thing we can really do for a family that\u2019s struggling is create a better job or a new job,\u201d he said.Mayors who cannot not raise the minimum wage focused, like Ms. Cooper, on requiring city contractors and vendors to pay a living wage to their employees. Mayor Sly James of Kansas City, Mo., said he had emailed his legal counsel and city manager after the jobs committee meeting to see if vendors and concessionaires could be required to pay workers more.An article on Monday about a discussion of issues facing the nation\u2019s cities misspelled the surname of the Chicago mayor who was cited as one of those trying to fight poverty with higher wages. He is Rahm Emanuel, not Emmanuel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aiming Financial Weapons From Treasury War Room", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a dingy suite of offices in a Treasury Department annex, the troops work into the night, armed with paperwork, computers and a clock on the wall set to Tehran time. They blast out advisories ordering banks to block targeted people, then threaten them with consequences \u2014 fines that can range into millions of dollars \u2014 if they do not.Today, this is how the Obama administration goes to war.\u201cThe United States needs to remain involved in the world, but does not necessarily need to remain involved just through military power,\u201d said David S. Cohen, Treasury\u2019s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, who is sometimes described within the administration as President Obama\u2019s favorite combatant commander. \u201cThere are other ways of projecting U.S. power that are consequential.\u201dMr. Cohen oversees the obscure Office of Foreign Assets Control, the engine that creates and administers the steadily increasing number of financial sanctions. They are a policy tool once considered largely ineffectual but are now used against a wide range of actors, from Iran\u2019s revolutionary guard to Mexican drug traffickers to cronies of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Over the last decade, as sanctions have become vastly more sophisticated, the Obama administration has deployed them more and more often. Including recent sanctions meant to punish Russia, the Treasury Department targets about 6,000 people and institutions around the world.\u201cThey\u2019ve always been a tool,\u201d said Robert Einhorn of the Brookings Institution, a former Obama administration official who worked on sanctions against both Iran and North Korea until he left the State Department last year. \u201cBut they\u2019ve gained new prominence, which is in part a reflection of greater creativity in the use of sanctions but also the success that the administration has had.\u201dThe sanctions against Iran for its nuclear work are considered the most successful in modern history, but sanctions on North Korea have been far less successful \u2014 primarily because China, the North\u2019s main patron, often made up for commodities or financial flows that other trading partners cut.\u201cNot every case will be an Iran case,\u201d Thomas E. Donilon, a former national security adviser to Mr. Obama, said on Monday at a conference in Washington, noting that the sanctions in North Korea did not work because the country was \u201cunplugged from the world economy.\u201d Other officials, including some from the Treasury Department, noted that there was a risk that sanctions can be overused \u2014 and as a result, countries could tire of enforcing them. The most recent American sanctions were imposed this spring, when the United States sanctioned a series of individuals and firms close to Mr. Putin, including Igor I. Sechin, the president of the state-owned Rosneft oil conglomerate, and Rossiya Bank, a provider of financial services to Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle. With the stroke of a pen, those sanctions froze the individuals and institutions out of the vast swath of the global financial market denominated in dollars \u2014 an action trumpeted by the Obama administration. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you we know the end of the story in Russia yet,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in an interview. \u201cBut I do know sanctions are a big part of why you\u2019re seeing some change.\u201dEconomic specialists say, however, that the impact of the sanctions is unclear so far. The administration has used targeted sanctions to unsettle the Russian elite \u2014 in particular, associates who have enriched themselves through proximity to Mr. Putin. The White House has argued that the sanctions have palpably harmed Russia\u2019s economy, pointing to weak data on economic output and a falling stock market. But those changes are most likely largely related to the broader geopolitical uncertainty leading investors to dump the ruble.\u201cPointing to ups and downs in the stock market, or growth numbers, in the short term is probably not the right measure of success,\u201d said Juan Zarate, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former official in the George W. Bush administration.Sanctions have also become a central policy lever with Iran, Syria, South Sudan and North Korea \u2014 as well as drug cartels, arms traders and terrorists. In no small part, their swelling number is because of their improved potency, analysts said: Today\u2019s sanctions tend to be \u201csmart,\u201d narrow rather than broad, and designed to pressure elites rather than squeezing average citizens.\u201cThe feeling 20 years ago was that they did not really work,\u201d said Daniel W. Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts, pointing to an embargo of Iraq that caused a humanitarian crisis without swaying then-ruler Saddam Hussein.Legal changes during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations bolstered the tool. Analysts started focusing on travel bans and asset freezes, rather than whole-country or whole-industry sanctions. The interconnectedness of the global economy has also made sanctions stronger.\u201cWe\u2019re very nuanced about how to use the tool and, I think, very thoughtful about it,\u201d said Adam J. Szubin, the director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. \u201cThe broad, sweeping dismissals have been proven false \u2014 sanctions don\u2019t work, can\u2019t work. Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don\u2019t. You have to use them smartly.\u201dPerhaps the most stark evidence of success lies in bolstered sanctions against Iran. Congress and the White House, alongside governments in Europe, have spurred a currency crisis and driven down prices for the country\u2019s crude oil, thus forcing Iran\u2019s leaders to the negotiating table.\u201cThere were excellent reasons to think that the new sanctions on Iran would not work, because we\u2019d been sanctioning them for 30 years,\u201d said Mr. Drezner. \u201cI think it caused a lot of people to think, \u2018Wow, these are a lot more powerful than we realized.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe sanctions are not without their detractors. Critics have argued both that Iran\u2019s sanctions are too harmful to the civilian economy and that they have failed to have enough effect on its nuclear program. Others say that the administration is relying far too heavily on sanctions.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that sanctions have become the dominant instrument of coercive statecraft,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cThis administration has become increasingly reluctant to use other forms of coercion, including covert action\u201d to achieve its policy goals, he said. But Treasury officials repeatedly said that sanctions were a part of, not a substitute for, a diplomatic policy \u2014 some sanctions worked better than others, and none were ever used in isolation.The Treasury \u201chas opened up a new battlefield for the United States,\u201d Mr. Lew said.

Instead, they say they want to help small, local businesses take on corporate giants and juggernaut revolutionaries like Uber.In return, the start-ups are able to tap into strong, distinctive businesses with longstanding ties to local communities, qualities that cannot easily be recreated online. KES Dispatch is a fixture in this leafy town in Westchester County, and Mr. Duarte knows the roads by heart and many of its residents by name.And even decidedly old-school sectors of the economy, like the livery industry, remain a huge market. There are over 200,000 taxi and limousine services in the United States, according to the industry research firm IBISWorld, with revenues of $11 billion.\u201cWhen you have disrupters like Uber and Lyft, it creates a need for the other 99 percent of the industry to update their tools, and for a company to sell them those tools,\u201d said Jonathan Axelrod, managing director of the New York-based Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator, which invested $40,000 in Dashride this year. Dashride is working on raising other financing.In addition to the mobile app, Dashride is helping KES Dispatch in other ways. All its 15 drivers will soon use smartphones to organize and manage rides, navigate streets and chat with clients.

So in 2012, he founded Cups.Customers with a monthly Cups subscription get unlimited coffee from a network of indie coffee shops, marked on an interactive map. Pricing for all-you-can-drink plans range from $45 to $85, depending on the types of coffee subscribers can order. Cups reimburses the shops for that coffee, after keeping a cut of the sales, while cafe owners get exposure and traffic.In Manhattan and Brooklyn, Cups has signed neighborhood stalwarts like the Bean and Pushcart Coffee. Mr. Rotem likes to call his collective New York City\u2019s third-biggest coffee chain, behind Starbucks and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. For customers, the allure of getting their coffee fix while helping to empower the independent coffee shop culture is Cups\u2019s biggest draw, he said.\u201cWe want to bring local coffee shops the economies of scale of big chains, but also have them keep their atmosphere and vibe,\u201d Mr. Rotem said.Jason Richelson is a pioneer in the field of start-ups aimed at helping local retailers. His company, ShopKeep, was born in 2008 from what he said was his misery working with the cumbersome hardware and systems he used to run his New York wine store. His rudimentary database kept crashing. His data server in the basement, linked to five computers upstairs, constantly malfunctioned.So Mr. Richelson developed ShopKeep and its iPad-based checkout system. In April, he raised $25 million in a third round of venture funding.Simplifying the nuts and bolts of selling can free up small business owners to focus on expanding their business or communicating with their customers, he said. \u201cSome of the only people who can expand now are the Starbucks of the world,\u201d Mr. Richelson said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is taking back Main Street for small businesses.\u201dIn the view of Shakr, small merchants can use some of the bells and whistles available to savvy start-ups or big corporations \u2014 like the video ads that run before YouTube clips.Tacky photo slide shows with awkward transitions just don\u2019t cut it among consumers with an increasingly voracious appetite for slick video, said David Lee, Shakr\u2019s founder and chief executive. Americans watched nearly 30 billion video ads online in March this year, according to the data company comScore. Rates for video ads can often be cheaper than advertising on a program like Google\u2019s AdWords.This month, Shakr announced it had secured its latest funding from Posco Venture Capital, bringing its total funding to $3 million.Edelweiss, in Seattle, was originally an online digital catalog of print books. It also runs an analytics service to allow booksellers to compare their sales anonymously with their peers, giving even small booksellers access to a vast amount of sales and marketing data.Mr. Rubin, a former management consultant, said he was initially skeptical of trying to work with feisty indie merchants. \u201cI was warned it would be like herding cats,\u201d he said.\u201cBut I just want to give them every edge, everything they can do to narrow the gap between Amazon and the bookstore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about helping those one or two people in the tiny back office. I want to help those guys.\u201dAn article on Monday about web-based start-ups that equip small local businesses with tools to help keep them abreast of technological change misstated the headquarters of one such start-up, Edelweiss, which is helping independent booksellers and publishers. It is based in Ann Arbor, Mich., not Seattle. The article also misstated the position of John Rubin, who commented on the company\u2019s efforts. He is chief executive of Above the Treeline, which operates Edelweiss \u2014 not of Edelweiss itself.Because of an editing error, a picture caption to an article on June 30 about web-based start-ups aimed at helping local businesses misstated the relationship of the entrepreneur Jason Richelson with the wine store Downtown Cellars. Mr. Richelson, who developed an iPad-based checkout system, used to own the store, which was then called Greene Grape Downtown; it is not currently \u201chis\u201d wine store.Advertisement"}

With a sigh, the woman held open her bag for the remaining ration at the mobile soup kitchen: a cup of warm turkey stew, a carton of low-fat milk, bagels and rolls.\u201cIt\u2019s been steadily increasing,\u201d said Juan De La Cruz, the food program director for the coalition. \u201cThere will be nights when we run short of food.\u201dThe coalition is seeking to expand its feeding efforts amid growing concern among some government officials and advocates for the poor about what they see as a hunger crisis in a city known for its five-star dining and culinary excesses.In a significant change, human resources officials also received a waiver last month of a federal work rule that cut off food stamps to thousands of New Yorkers a year. Under that rule, more than 46,000 so-called able-bodied adults \u2014 ages 18 to 49 with no dependents \u2014 had to work at least 20 hours a week or participate in job training to continue receiving an average of $35 a week in food stamps after three months, according to city officials.\u201cIt made no sense to make New Yorkers go hungry as punishment for being underemployed \u2014 working less than 20 hours a week \u2014 or being unable to find employment in a continuing difficult economy,\u201d said Steven Banks, commissioner of the agency. He added that the cost of having more people on food stamps would be covered entirely by federal aid and that the local economy would only benefit from more dollars being spent at groceries and bodegas.The Coalition for the Homeless feeds up to 1,200 people a night during the summer, its busiest time. Meals to go are handed out at St. Bartholomew\u2019s Church on Park Avenue and carried by three vans to more than two dozen preset locations. The feeding program, which costs about $750,000 a year, is financed with government funds, foundation grants and private donations.Dane Hudson, 24, an unemployed diesel mechanic who has been staying with friends in the Bronx and Brooklyn, said that most nights he went to the church because his food stamps were not enough to cover his meals for the month. \u201cIt\u2019s hard in this city,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really see the line between the haves and the have-nots.\u201dAn army of volunteers serves the meals night after night. At precisely 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Fernell High slid behind the wheel of a van loaded with 380 meals. Mr. High, 43, a building engineer, said he saw homeless people camped out at Grand Central Terminal nearly two decades ago, and rather than just step over them, decided he wanted to help.As he drove up to the first stop, on 35th Street under the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, two dozen people stood waiting. \u201cI can save my money instead of buying food,\u201d said Timm Tyler, 50, who was laid off from his job as a clerk at a health center this spring and lives in a nearby shelter. \u201cThe bottom line is they need more programs like this.\u201dLater, on Lafayette Street, an eager crowd swarmed around as Mr. High jumped out of the van, threw open the back doors and called for order as he handed out plastic bags. One woman, saying she was old, tried to push past him. \u201cEverybody\u2019s old,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou still have to wait.\u201dBy 9 p.m. the food was gone.

{"Headline": "A Swede That\u2019s Not Square to Be Hip", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the WheelSay \u201cVolvo,\u201d and what image springs to mind? A station wagon, right? And not just any wagon, but one as square and imperishable as a Saltine, and as much a staple of the suburbs.So when Volvo stopped selling wagons in America, it was a seismic event. Like many automakers, Volvo saw the writing on the family wall. With its S.U.V.s exponentially outselling traditional wagons, Volvo slammed the tailgate shut in 2011 as the V50 waved goodbye to America.Now the Volvo wagon rides again, joining a band of outliers including the Audi Allroad, BMW 328i Sports Wagon, Acura TSX Sport Wagon and Cadillac CTS wagon. And though this lovely 2015 entry looks nothing like Swedish Conestogas of yore, the V60 has the familiar Volvo attributes of safety, ease and practicality \u2014 and a new bonus of class-leading fuel economy. Like its sibling, the XC60 crossover S.U.V., the V60 heralds the downsized Drive-E powertrains that will soon be offered throughout the Volvo lineup. (Despite the E-name, the cars do not have electric propulsion, although hybrid versions are planned.) The V60 gets a 2-liter direct-injected turbo 4-cylinder that produces 240 horsepower and a rich 258 pound-feet of torque. Coincidentally or not, the BMW 328i xDrive Sports Wagon makes the same 240 horsepower, with 255 pound-feet, from its 2-liter turbo. But with the identical 8 forward speeds as the BMW (in a smooth-shifting automatic transmission), the Volvo\u2019s outstanding economy rating of 37 miles per gallon on the highway, and 25 in town, actually tops the BMW by 4 m.p.g. on the highway and 3 in the city. As you\u2019d expect, the Volvo also costs less. The T5 Drive-E test car started at $36,225, about $6,000 below the basic Bimmer, and reached $42,225 with options.The V60 has shed Volvo\u2019s square chrysalis and emerged as a Swedish butterfly. This is the prettiest wagon to come down the turnpike in some time. Even busy New Yorkers took time to pay compliments.The roofline drops to a rendezvous with the rising flanks. Volvo\u2019s signature flowing taillamps, which recall a pair of high-back Lucite chairs, draw the eye to a saucy, forward-leaning hatch. This sporty, compact design takes a toll on utility: If you\u2019re expecting a furniture warehouse on wheels, like the defunct war horse V70, you\u2019ll be looking elsewhere. Dropping the rear seats opens a modest 43.8 cubic feet of storage. The similar-size Audi Allroad and BMW Sports Wagon manage a respective 50.5 and 53 cubes, though I found the Volvo\u2019s hatch nearly as practical in real-world use. It is far smaller, however, than the 67.4 cubic feet of cargo space in the midsize XC60 crossover. Consider the Volvo more of a sporty grocery-getter for couples or families who travel light. The rear seat is split in a 40/20/40 arrangement, and folding the center section creates a generously wide pass-through for long gear. The leather-wrapped armrest with cup holders and storage, roughly a foot wide, is perfect for keeping children apart and cooties at bay. 8 PhotosIn Scandinavian fashion, the cabin design is minimal yet stylish, including Volvo\u2019s falling waterfall console, brushed metal trim and a kind of elephant-hide-grained plastic on the dash. Front or rear, the seats are magnificent (including optional white-stitched sport seats), so luxuriously stuffed yet supportive that they should win some orthopedic seal of approval. My test car\u2019s $1,500 Sport package added to the looks and performance, with those white-stitched seats, smoke-finished 19-inch alloy wheels and a set of surprisingly robust and tactile metal paddle shifters on the steering wheel. A central infotainment screen greatly improves on Volvo\u2019s usual stingy units, but still trails other systems that are easier to use. My test car, thankfully, came without the optional navigation system. Geely, Volvo\u2019s Chinese owners, might bolt in a counterfeit hand-held from a Beijing alley that would do a smarter job.Volvo needs no such help on safety. Its standard, pioneering City Safety system, now mimicked by some competitors, can automatically stop the V60 at speeds up to 31 m.p.h. if it detects potential collisions with cars or pedestrians. The $900 B.L.I.S. package added the radar-based Blind Spot Information System, rear cross-traffic alert and parking sensors front and rear. Drivers can reconfigure the digital driver\u2019s display, switching a central speedometer for a tachometer or adjusting colors and effects: If you toggle up the teal-colored Eco display, then press too hard on the gas pedal, the screen glows red like an angry blister. The display is attractive and momentarily diverting, though it\u2019s mainly for show \u2014 it is not linked to actual performance settings. Consider it Volvo\u2019s mood ring.A separate Eco switch does change the car\u2019s behavioral mind-set. Like a Porsche system, its eco-coast function uses a clutch to fully disengage the powertrain and save fuel when you\u2019re not pressing the accelerator. But I found myself switching off Eco mode because of its obtrusive engine start/stop function, which unfortunately defaults to \u201con\u201d each time you start the car.Even without Eco mode, I managed 35 m.p.g. on a long highway cruise. That\u2019s 2 m.p.g. shy of the federal estimate, but still outstanding mileage for a wagon with so much power, aided by the discreet-shifting transmission.Labeling a 4-cylinder car a T5 may be confusing. But clarity comes with a 6.1-second sprint to 60 m.p.h., plenty quick for a family wagon. That time lengthens to 6.8 seconds for the T5 AWD model, a $37,725 version that does have 5 cylinders: Volvo\u2019s older 2.5-liter engine that makes 250 turbocharged horses. Owners who insist on shaking up the neighborhood can have the $45,225 T6 AWD R-Design, a sport-tuned version with 325 horsepower from a 3-liter in-line turbo 6. When pushed, the V60 will give chase, with a linear wave of turbo power and surprisingly ample grip from its fat 19-inch tires.The chassis also strikes an equitable balance between ride smoothness and control, though body motions could be more tamped down. Undulating high-speed pavement, especially, begins to unsettle the V60 like a storm-tossed rowboat.For all types of driving, the main demerit \u2014 as in some other Volvos \u2014 are brakes that feel mushy and less than powerful. For a brand whose reputation rests on safety, these wimpy binders should prompt engineering meetings in Gothenburg.But it seems that even the world\u2019s strongest brakes cannot stop Americans from fleeing wagons for taller-riding crossovers. I\u2019m sure Volvo will continue to sell several XC60s for every V60 that leaves the showroom.But cult status isn\u2019t always a bad thing. Drivers who want crossover utility, but demand superior handling and mileage, can have it in a wagon \u2014 and break the cookie-cutter suburban mold while they\u2019re at it. Advertisement"}

While the city\u2019s vacant buildings are clearly a challenge, these neighborhoods demonstrate that they are also an opportunity for Detroit to reinvent its economy.Preservationists understand that demolition must be part of the strategy for Detroit\u2019s future, but we need to ensure that the city\u2019s most important historic buildings are spared so they can become building blocks for the future. Surveys to determine which of the city\u2019s buildings are eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places have already been completed, and they need to be considered before large-scale demolition begins.As your article points out, Detroit currently has more than 100,000 vacant lots. Before creating thousands more vacant lots, the city should fully consider ways to preserve its important historic buildings.The writer is the president and chief executive of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\u00a0To the Editor:Regarding the $850 million that Detroit is considering for demolition of dilapidated and abandoned buildings: It is shocking how conventional the thinking still is. Millions have been spent over the years on demolitions, to negligible effect.There is an alternative. Detroit is filling with young people starting businesses, restaurants and renovations of all kinds. These endeavors have been enabled by the meltdown of the glacier of regulation typical of most cities.It isn\u2019t just that streetlights and public services can\u2019t be supported in Detroit; neither can the bureaucracy. Most of these entrepreneurs are working with no help from government. What if those millions of dollars were granted, say, for start-ups, to the folks with proven initiative: those under 30, many of whom have been shut out by the Great Recession?At $50,000 each there would be 17,000 loans or grants possible. Detroit would explode with activity and success. Its emerging reputation as the \u201cnext Brooklyn\u201d would be fulfilled, even more quickly.The diversity required for such grants should not be by gender, race or class, but by age.

{"Headline": "Redrawn Lines Seen as No Cure in Iraq Conflict", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Over the past two weeks, the specter that has haunted Iraq since its founding 93 years ago appears to have become a reality: the de facto partition of the country into Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish cantons.With jihadists continuing to entrench their positions across the north and west, and the national army seemingly incapable of mounting a challenge, Americans and even some Iraqis have begun to ask how much blood and treasure it is worth to patch the country back together. It is a question that echoes not only in Syria \u2014 also effectively divided into mutually hostile statelets \u2014 but also across the entire Middle East, where centrifugal forces unleashed by the Arab uprisings of 2011 continue to erode political structures and borders that have prevailed since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire a century ago.Yet Iraq and Syria\u2019s potential fragmentation along sectarian or ethnic lines is not likely to offer any solution to the region\u2019s dysfunction, analysts say, and may well generate new conflicts driven by ideology, oil, and other resources.\u201cAt least a third of the country is beyond Baghdad\u2019s control, not counting Kurdistan,\u201d said Zaid al Ali, an Iraqi analyst and the author of \u201cThe Struggle for Iraq\u2019s Future.\u201d \u201cBut any effort to make that official would likely lead to an even greater disaster \u2014 not least because of the many mixed areas of the country, including Baghdad, where blood baths would surely ensue as different groups tried to establish facts on the ground.\u201dEfforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.The Obama administration has urged Iraqi politicians of different sects to come together, repeating admonitions that were so often heard in the years after the 2003 invasion. But the Pentagon \u2014 reluctant to commit more manpower to a complex and profoundly uncertain conflict \u2014 has quietly hinted it could live with Iraq\u2019s current division, despite the dangers posed by a potential new terrorist sanctuary in the deserts linking Syria and Iraq.The context this time is different from a decade ago: Sectarian hatred has begun to alter the region\u2019s political DNA in ways that make the old borders more vulnerable. Many ordinary Sunnis describe the seizing of Mosul and other cities as a popular revolution against a Shiite-led government, not a terrorist onslaught. With Iran, their historic enemy, now lining up drones and other military supplies to help the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki retake the north \u2014 and protect the south \u2014 many Sunnis may become further alienated from the state.The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, which supplied the shock troops of the assault on Mosul, has made vigorous efforts to inculcate a new identity for those living within its growing transnational sphere, setting up Shariah courts and publicizing videos in which its fighters burn their passports. Last week, the group issued an eight-page report denouncing the Middle Eastern border system as a colonialist imposition, and included photographs of its fighters destroying what it called \u201ccrusader partitions\u201d between Iraq and Syria.At the same time, the ISIS onslaught has made the formal secession of Iraqi Kurdistan far more plausible. The crisis led Iraqi soldiers to flee from Kirkuk, the contested oil-rich northern city that was among the last major obstacles to Kurdish independence. Across the border in Syria, a Kurdish region in the country\u2019s north is also effectively independent of Damascus, with its own military and provisional government. And Turkey, which in the past strongly opposed an independent Kurdish state on its border, now sees the Kurds as a stable buffer between itself and the extremists of ISIS.The division of Iraq into three parts has been proposed in the past as a solution to the country\u2019s problems. In 2006, Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, promoted the idea, invoking a comparison with the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the Dayton Accords in the mid-1990s. But much has changed over the past eight years: Division is now largely a fait accompli. Reversing it would take enormous resources, even if the United States and Iran were to find ways to cooperate toward that goal \u2014 a convergence that would itself enrage and perhaps radicalize many of the region\u2019s Sunni Arabs.For the most part, Iraqis (with the exception of the Kurds) reject the idea of partition, according to recent interviews and opinion polls taken several years ago. In that sense, Iraq forms a striking contrast with the former Yugoslavia, where militias worked consciously from the start to carve out new and ethnically exclusive national enclaves. The sectarian strain may have led to Iraq\u2019s current impasse, but it coexists with other sources of regional and ideological solidarity, some deeply rooted in history.Partly for that reason, many analysts say, the current division of Iraq \u2014 while it may prove irreversible in the end \u2014 does not represent a return to a more authentic or harmonious dispensation, nor is it likely to better address the Middle East\u2019s sources of political and social failure.\u201cYou could split these countries into two or three or four, and you\u2019d have the same practice of power in each of those units,\u201d said Peter Harling, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group who spent 15 years living in Iraq and Syria. \u201cThe problem is the divisive and autocratic and corrupt way power is practiced, not the borders.\u201dFor all the jihadis\u2019 boasts about founding a new caliphate \u2014 or Islamic state \u2014 the prospects of building any sort of cohesive or sustainable new Sunni entity in the region are slim. Already, there have been reports of factional battles among the gunmen who captured Mosul two weeks ago. The jihadists\u2019 main partner in the north is a network of Iraqi Baathist former military officers with links to Sufism, an Islamic sect the jihadists view as heretical.There are also renewed signs of division among the Shiites, including the refusal of Moktada al-Sadr, who commands the powerful militia known as the Mahdi Army, to fight under the banner of the Iraqi Army. Similar divisions among Shiite factions have often led to violence in the past, including the 2008 battle in Basra between Mr. Maliki\u2019s forces and the Mahdi Army.The logistical obstacles may be larger than the ideological ones. In Syria, it is often assumed that President Bashar al-Assad could lead a retreat to the Alawite heartland along the Mediterranean coast, an area that briefly enjoyed statehood under the French protectorate after World War I. But his government views that territory as far too vulnerable because it is cut off from Syria\u2019s main water sources and because it would lack the major cities that are at the core of the economy, said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma.Similar problems would afflict any effort to forge a new Sunni state in Iraq and Syria. For such a state to become sustainable it would need a real economy, and for that, it would require a major city \u2014 Aleppo is the only option \u2014 and probably a port on the Mediterranean, Mr. Landis said. Negotiating a land corridor that would achieve those goals without endangering the Alawite state would be nearly impossible, he added.In Iraq, it has long been assumed that the Shiite heartland of southern Iraq, where the major oil fields are, would give the Shiites a tremendous advantage, leaving the Sunnis with only the vast landlocked deserts to the north and west. But northern Iraq also controls both of the country\u2019s major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, which flow southward toward Basra. That could provide one more reason for Mr. Maliki, or his successors, to fight hard for the recapture of the north and west.The prospect of a more formal partition in Iraq or Syria, however unlikely that may seem right now, could also lead to mass migrations and further turmoil, judging by some recent examples of state partition, like the division of Sudan in 2011, or that of India and Pakistan in 1947. Those breakups were the result of long struggles and led to terrible violence.In light of all this, many analysts say it is far more likely that the current Arab borders will persist, and greater power will ultimately be devolved to provinces and cities \u2014 a process that has already been underway since the Arab uprisings. In Yemen, another country where insurgency has effectively divided the country, there has been extensive discussion of a plan to designate six new federal regions, each with substantial autonomy.Iraq\u2019s Constitution already allows such federal devolution to be worked out. But in their current polarized state, Iraq\u2019s leaders scarcely seem capable of agreeing on anything.\u201cFundamentally, we have to answer the question: Do we Iraqis want to live in the same country?\u201d said Feisal al-Istrabadi, an Iraqi diplomat who teaches law at Indiana University. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, then we need to find a better way to separate than what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disapproval of Obama Doesn\u2019t Mean Long-Term Trouble for Democrats", "Date": "2014-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolling and PoliticsThe low approval ratings are not nearly as low as Mr. Bush\u2019s, but they are low enough to entertain the possibility that it will put Democrats at a disadvantage. Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings sank to a comparable level in 2010, ahead of a landslide Republican victory in the midterm elections that year.But Mr. Obama\u2019s lower approval ratings don\u2019t necessarily pose a great danger to the next Democratic presidential candidate. His low ratings might just reflect the difficulty of maintaining election-year levels of support from Democratic-leaning voters, and the difficulty of earning crossover support in an increasingly polarized era.No president has averaged 90-plus-percent approval ratings among his partisans throughout his term, even though about 90 percent of partisans usually vote for their party in presidential elections. Bill Clinton, for instance, averaged an 84 percent approval rating among Democrats in Gallup\u2019s polls in 1997, before impeachment and the economic boom pushed his ratings up into the upper 80s in 1998. That\u2019s only a tick higher than Mr. Obama\u2019s 80 percent approval rating among Democrats in Gallup surveys so far this year, or the 82 percent approval rating in the most recent ABC/Washington Post poll.Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton earned significantly higher general approval ratings than Mr. Obama because he earned considerable crossover support, including from about 30 percent of Republicans. Mr. Obama\u2019s opposition has been extremely unified. That makes it difficult for Mr. Obama to earn overall approval ratings at or above 50 percent.So Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings don\u2019t necessarily mean that he has lost an unusual amount of support where it matters. Mr. Obama might well be retaining the approval of a healthy percentage of his supporters from 2012, with his approval ratings deceptively low because of nearly unanimous Republican opposition.It\u2019s hard to find evidence suggesting that Mr. Obama\u2019s weakness stems from a deeper problem, like alienating some portion of Democratic-leaning voters.Demographics are another explanation for the resilience of the Democratic coalition.The growing nonwhite share of the electorate increases the burden on Republicans to break through to voters who traditionally lean Democratic in presidential elections. The Democratic coalition might one day fracture along its many economic, cultural or racial faults. But the Democrats are remarkably united now.The diversity of the Democratic coalition makes it harder for Republicans in 2016, not Democrats. Diversity makes broad gains more difficult, and means that there isn\u2019t a single policy that solves G.O.P. woes. If Republicans make a big concession on immigration reform, and make big gains among Hispanics, it doesn\u2019t hurt Democrats in Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania.And at the moment, it\u2019s hard to argue that things are so bad that Democrats would be losing voters who have supported them in the last six presidential elections. The G.O.P. isn\u2019t exactly broadening its appeal to fairly reliable Democratic voters, either. That makes it hard to imagine that the G.O.P. will capitalize on all of Mr. Obama\u2019s various low approval ratings among core Democratic constituencies, like his 53 percent approval rating among Hispanics in a recent Washington Post poll.The polls don\u2019t show Republicans capitalizing on those weaknesses. The same Washington Post survey shows Democrats ahead by 2 points on the generic congressional ballot \u2014 where voters are asked whom they will vote for in the upcoming congressional election \u2014 despite Mr. Obama\u2019s low ratings.The polls also show that Democrats are maintaining their advantage in partisan identification, and faring about as well as one would expect in Senate contests in presidential battleground states like Colorado, Iowa and Michigan. The races for governor aren\u2019t great for Republicans, with incumbent Republicans trailing in Pennsylvania and locked in tight races in states like Florida and Wisconsin. Democrats haven\u2019t yet reassembled the Democratic coalition and jumped to 51 percent, but the Republicans certainly haven\u2019t yet made inroads.That\u2019s nothing like 2006 or 2008, when Republicans trailed on the generic ballot by about 10 points and fell behind in party identification, and when incumbent Republican senators were being crushed in the presidential battleground states of Pennsylvania and Ohio while trailing slightly in the red states of Missouri and Montana.Republicans might ultimately break through and start faring better on light blue turf. That would be better evidence that the Democrats have a problem reassembling their coalition. Then again, Democratic weaknesses in 2010 \u2014 like Senator Russ Feingold\u2019s defeat in Wisconsin \u2014 didn\u2019t augur much for 2012.Perhaps the economy and Obama fatigue will be bad enough that Republicans win that elusive median voter in Wisconsin, who has voted Democratic in the last seven presidential elections. But what makes the Democratic coalition so strong is that this is exactly the type of voter Republicans need to win in 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How We Play the Game", "Date": "2014-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementEvery team is simply trying to score goals while preventing its opponent from doing the same. But they all seem to go about it in distinct ways, don\u2019t they? To understand what is happening on the fields in Brazil at the World Cup, one must learn a bit about each country\u2019s history, and literature, and music, and regionalism, and economy \u2013 not to mention bicycles and pottery. If you look closely enough at the X\u2019s and O\u2019s, you just might find a national poem.No other activity brought over from Europe took root so widely and so immediately. This resulted in an imaginative style of play that made competition and gratifying playfulness inseparable, with blacks and people of mixed race rising from exclusion and becoming its main protagonists.Outside the confines of formal championships, the sport was quickly taken up as a game played in abandoned lots, meadows and urban gaps.This style of play took over the championships and official clubs in the 1930s and gained international recognition for the first time during the 1938 World Cup. At the time, the sociologist Gilberto Freyre believed soccer confirmed his own thesis, explored in two classic tomes on Brazilian culture, \u201cThe Masters and the Slaves\u201d and \u201cThe Mansions and the Shanties.\u201d Brazilian soccer style transformed the \u201cBritish and Apollonian\u201d game into \u201cDionysian dance\u201d; straight and angular European soccer became sinuous and curving as it took on the body movements of samba dancers and the martial art dancers and fighters of Brazilian capoeira. Freyre saw in it an affirmation of a tropical and mestizo culture that would enable it to reverse the stigmas of a heritage of slavery.Whether these ideas were conscious or not, the style prevailed throughout the triumphs in the 1958, 1962 and 1970 World Cups, when Brazilian soccer became renowned. It brought together competitive efficiency with inventive and beautiful moves. Pel\u00e9 and Garrincha soared during the golden phase of soccer\u2019s high modern form.To the Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini, the Brazilian style was \u201cpoetic soccer\u201d based on dribbling and a nonlinear opening of unforeseen spaces, as opposed to the linearly responsible \u201cprose soccer\u201d prevalent in Europe. The historian Eric Hobsbawm noted that, at that point, mass culture worldwide was becoming North American or provincial, with the exception of the Brazilian national team. And it is only fair to add that the same thing could be said of bossa nova, Tom Jobim and Jo\u00e3o Gilberto (as well as the Beatles, of course).Let us say that at least at its foundations, Brazilian soccer did not obey Anglo-Saxon pragmatism nor any form of Cartesianism. Instead, it took advantage of a margin of relatively gratuitous unproductivity allowed in soccer, the least numerical of all ball games, to open the way for a culture of the periphery \u2014 a culture that is elliptical and festive and in which \u201ccarnaval\u201d is a verb. CLASSIC GOAL1970BRAZIL vs. ITALYAlbertoPel\u00e9Rivelino12JairzinhoThis phenomenon, this wide recognition, has also always been seen as a factor of political alienation, perpetuating backwardness, and the failure to tackle the real problems of an unequal society. Soccer is seen ambivalently in Brazil both as a model of possible achievements, since the nation succeeded with its own winning style of play, and as an emblem for all that the country fails to accomplish in education, health, distribution of wealth and political transparency. We could say soccer achieves in the playing field a racial democracy that Brazilian society does not. It showcases the proliferation of talent as well as the inability, the irresponsibility and the narrowness of the private interests that manage them.Over the past few decades world soccer has become more athletic, more in demand, more planned, collective and mercantile. The old \u201cpoetic soccer\u201d lost much of its leeway, although it has not ceased to exist, nor, more important, has it ceased to be an object of desire in Brazil. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Wisnik is a Brazilian musician, composer and essayist who writes frequently about soccer. He is the author of \u201cPoison Remedy,\u201d a book about soccer in Brazilian society.It\u2019s also deeply confused. As a former England captain put it to me recently: \u201cWe\u2019re all over the place. What is the English football philosophy these days? We have no idea what our system should be.\u201dOther nations have developed coherent modern soccer identities.  But the game\u2019s mother country is stranded between then and now. What next?Other nations have developed coherent modern soccer identities.  But the game\u2019s mother country is stranded between then and now.At this World Cup, England Coach Roy Hodgson could follow most of his predecessors and deploy the traditional, failed bulldog, blood-and-thunder approach in a creaky old 4-4-2 formation. Alternatively, he might try to exploit the talent of a new generation of young players who have grown up in the innovative, foreigner-dominated Premier League. Fiercely competitive, money-driven club soccer in England has changed in ways the history-burdened national team has yet to match. Bright, quick, technical young things like Liverpool\u2019s Daniel Sturridge or Arsenal\u2019s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere are now as well educated to play the modern game as their peers in Spain or Germany.But will they be allowed to do that for England?Reflecting the uncertainty of a country in which the anti-Europe U.K. Independence Party won elections to the European Parliament recently, no one has a clue. To understand why, we must look to history.Soccer has long been a bastion of a peculiarly 19th-century conception of Englishness the nation seems reluctant to relinquish. The game was born during the era of empire when the country\u2019s elite public schools adapted earlier forms of violent folk football for the purpose of education.  Typical rustic folk games involved hundreds of drunken men from rival villages rampaging through streets and fields, trying to drive, say, a casket of beer (the proto-ball) into the crypt of a church (the proto-goal). The schools distilled such testosterone-fuelled rituals into new formats involving smaller teams, sober boys and sodden leather balls. \nCodified by the Football Association and later disseminated to the world, this style of soccer was never the so-called beautiful game; the original purpose of educators was to instill manly and martial virtues into future imperial soldiers and administrators.  1966CLASSIC GOALENGLAND vs. MEXICOPe\u00f1aCharlton2Carbajal3CharltonCharlton1The British Empire vanished long ago, but its legacy lingers, not least in the grass roots of English soccer where team spirit, courage and a willingness to endure pain still count for more than skill, intelligence or creativity. The archetypal English hero remains the lionhearted cartoon character Roy Race, better known as Roy of the Rovers: a warriorlike center forward who specialized in \u201cbullet headers\u201d and \u201ccannonball\u201d shots. Even now, English TV and radio commentators talk of the season as a \u201ccampaign\u201d and of strikers \u201cleading the charge\u201d as if soccer were a Victorian-era war game.Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, soccer changed profoundly, and skill, intelligence and creativity came to be recognized as prerequisites for success. From the 1950s onward, encounters with soccer geniuses from other lands left the game\u2019s onetime English masters looking like charging bulls bewildered by the movements of a cape. Just as adapting to their diminished, post-imperial status in international affairs has been a struggle, so the English are taking a long time to abandon the fantasy that, having invented the game, they should still expect to win the World Cup.The truth \u2014 as everyone elsewhere noticed long ago \u2014 is that the nation has only once gone further than the quarterfinals of a major tournament played abroad (it reached the semifinals in Italy in 1990).English soccer confusion, delusion and cloying nostalgia have become tedious. The time for the national team to adopt a bit of modesty and modernity \u2014 and to move to embrace change \u2014 is long overdue. David Winner is the author of \u201cThose Feet: A Sensual History of English Soccer\u201d and \u201cBrilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Soccer.\u201dItaly\u2019s best performances have come in the wake of defeat, disaster and scandal.All right, I was lucky. But there was method to my prediction. When the Azzurri are on edge and feel they have something to prove, they deliver. When they ease off, they\u2019re useless. Italy\u2019s worst performances in the World Cup have been preceded by great expectations: Germany in 1974, after reaching the final in Mexico; Mexico in 1986, after winning in Spain; South Korea and Japan in 2002, after doing well in Europe; and in South Africa 2010, after arriving as champions. Italy\u2019s best performances have come in the wake of defeat, disaster and scandal.That\u2019s why things are looking good for Brazil 2014. Italian soccer has been faring badly in Europe, and clubs seem to be in thrall to hooliganism and bad debts. The soft-spoken coach Cesare Prandelli had to swallow his pride when he called up Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini, who was ejected for a nasty foul against Roma. Soccer purists are furious, Prandelli is annoyed, and the Italian sports authorities are embarrassed. So far, so good.CLASSIC GOAL1982ITALY vs. WEST GERMANY1Horst HrubeschBriegelAltobelliGentile32ContiIn soccer as in life, we Italians tend to do best when our backs are against the wall. For most people, that is not a particularly comfortable position. But we seem to enjoy it. In economics, politics and ordinary life, Italy needs to be smarting, and maybe a little scared, to get cranked up. In the past three and half years, we have produced four prime ministers \u2014 the latest an inexperienced 39-year-old \u2014 and lashings of economic angst. Glance at the British and the American news over this period, and you\u2019re going to find plenty of \u201cEuro Crisis!\u201d and \u201cItaly on the Brink!\u201d headlines.But we like brinks. The view is fantastic.I was in Colorado for the Aspen Ideas Festival in June 2012. The euro crisis was at its peak, European Union heads of government were gathering for an emergency summit in Brussels, and that night, Italy was playing Germany in the European Championship. I was on a panel that was not so much a discussion as a funeral for the euro. When it was my turn to speak, I said: \u201cGermany will find a way to sort out the euro crisis, and Italy will find a way to sort out the Germans in the beautiful game. We both have too much at stake.\u201d Once again, I was right.I\u2019m no prophet. I just know my country well. Being Italian is a full-time job because we never forget who we are \u2014 in life or on the field \u2014 and we like to befuddle our opponents. The Italian style of soccer is elegant, seductive and unpredictable. Germany, England and the Netherlands may have a more macho, run-till-you-drop approach, but Italy is a signora, a lady who entices and strikes when you get too close. Catenaccio \u2014 the lock and chain \u2014 is an obviously defensive sexual metaphor while a contropiede \u2014 the sudden counterattack \u2014 is inevitable when the lady decides she has had enough of your clumsy approaches.Italians adore appearances, and sometimes we put aesthetics before ethics, which can be a problem. La bella figura \u2014 making a good impression \u2014 is a crucial concept to grasp if you want to get a handle on Italy. \u201cLa Grande Bellezza\u201d \u2014 the Great Beauty \u2014 just won the Oscar for best foreign movie, and beauty is what we like to display on the field. Like a lot of other teams, admittedly. But for Germany, beauty is organization. For England, it is dedication and work rate. For Brazil, beauty is a dance. But for us and for Argentina \u2014 Italy squared, if you look at their names and faces! \u2014 beauty is breathtaking speed.The American team will try hard and do reasonably well, as always. Italy could be a finalist or leave Brazil in disgrace. Rest assured the Azzurri will surprise or disappoint everyone. They\u2019ll argue \u2014 with the press, the fans and one another \u2014 until the opening match against England on June 14 in Manaus. Predictable is boring; unexpected is amazing. The signora wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.Beppe Severgnini is a columnist at Corriere della Sera and the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind.\u201dBut if there is one thing that my lifelong engagement with Germany has shown me, it is that the country has no meaningful national characteristics. The notion of a workmanlike character is merely a stereotype; it is not a proper explanation for the national culture or a team\u2019s style of play.If there is one thing that my lifelong engagement with Germany has shown me, it is that the country has no meaningful national characteristics.To best understand Germany\u2019s national soccer team, look to its structure and its origins. The team has been called workmanlike since playing the Austrian Wunderteam in the 1930s, and, later, Hungary\u2019s famous national team known as the Magnificent Magyars. The underdog Germans had no stars \u2014 very workmanlike of them \u2014but still managed to defeat the Hungarian squad in the Miracle of Bern in 1954, Germany\u2019s first World Cup win.You could point to that game as the founding of the modern Federal Republic of Germany, the solid but decidedly unsexy entity that produced the German Economic Miracle and turned into a quiet economic giant and a political dwarf. The 1954 team\u2019s victory became part of the country\u2019s self-image of unflashy reliability that was so welcomed domestically and internationally after National Socialism\u2019s incandescent horrors.BeckenbauerCLASSIC GOAL1966WEST GERMANY vs. SWITZERLANDBeckenbauer2SEELER1H\u00f6ttgesHallerThe team\u2019s playing style had much to do with its manager, the renowned Sepp Herberger, who coached the team from 1936 until 1964 and was known as Chef. Chef was a Yogi-Berra-esque character who had no patience for stars.But in 1966, the German team had an emergent star: Franz Beckenbauer, soon to be called Kaiser. He was joined by a group of other standouts like Wolfgang Overath, Gerd M\u00fcller and G\u00fcnter Netzer who led the national team to the European championship in 1972 and the world championship two years later. German soccer was all flair and panache with little of the reliable plodding of the past.After the Kaiser, German\u2019s national squad featured players like Jurgen Klinsmann who were superb but did not have the Kaiser\u2019s flair. Again, the team was described as clinical, effective and, yes, workmanlike.Forty years later, when Klinsmann coached the German team, his squad played some of the most attractive offense of any team anywhere. The same could be said four years later in South Africa, but many attributed the panache of that team to players like Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira \u2014 in other words, players who some said were Germans by passport but not by culture.Ozil has often said his skills combine Turkish flair and German perseverance, thus making it clear that even the players see global soccer through a cultural lens.

He is the author of \u201cGaming the World: How Sports Are Reshaping Global Politics and Culture.\u201dAn impressive statement. But what does it mean to be a modern-day Rembrandt? And why not a contemporary van Gogh? A Piet Mondrian? A Pieter Jansz Saenredam? Or simply a modern-day Johan Cruyff?The Dutch tend to divide their soccer history into two periods: B.C., before Johan Cruyff, and the period after.The Dutch tend to divide their soccer history into two periods \u2014 before and after Cruyff. B.C. (Before Cruyff), it was plain, ordinary, pragmatic soccer we played. With the birth of the great Cruyff came Total Football: an exciting game, focused on attacking, with all players capable of changing positions and a keen eye for the open space in the playing field.\nIt was Rinus Michels, the coach of Ajax and of the Dutch team at the 1974 World Cup, who was the inspiring architect of the Total Football concept. But it was Cruyff who took the concept to a different level. The Dutch team\u2019s game consisted of well-organized chaos. Cruyff, at the epicenter, arranged the play while checking from above that it all went well. To put it biblically, on the field he was God and Jesus blended into one player.Cruyff gave the game an aura of the avant-garde at a time when Dutch society was undergoing significant changes. Cruyff, a cheeky young man from a working-class neighborhood, played for Ajax Amsterdam in the city of the antiauthoritarian Provo movement. He went against the establishment and never stopped trying to turn things around in his favor. If he was largely motivated by money, he was still a revolutionary person, a Dutch John Lennon.CLASSIC GOAL1974THE NETHERLANDS vs. WEST GERMANYCruyffRijsbergen12CruyffCruyffHoeness3CruyffCruyffVogtsHis mantra was to make the playing field big when you had the ball and make it small when the opponent had it. The British author David Winner, in his book \u201cBrilliant Orange,\u201d compared Cruyff to Saenredam, the 17th-century Dutch painter who was famous for manipulating space on the canvas.Cruyff convinced the nation that playing beautiful soccer is a typically Dutch thing.We have a habit in this way. There are some signature Dutch products that have been, let\u2019s say, incorporated from elsewhere. Tulips originally came from Turkey. Delft pottery was a cheap alternative to Chinese porcelain. The traditional black bicycle, an extension of any Dutch person\u2019s body, was invented in England as a women\u2019s bicycle and only became Dutch because we failed to keep up with the new designs. The Dutch are good at making something their own and then telling the rest that theirs is the only way.Arthur van den Boogaard recently finished his book \u201cZo Speelden Wij\u201d (\u201cThis Is How We Played\u201d), in which he reconstructs 14 historical matches of the Dutch national team to show that the way they were played mirrored the Dutch soul.The conventional wisdom was that the Spanish players did not care enough because their loyalties lay more with their regions of origin than with their country. Spain could not win, it was said, because there was no such thing as Spain in the Spanish players\u2019 hearts.Spain climbed to the top of world soccer by putting longstanding regional rivalries aside.Indeed, regional identity and tensions often play out in the field, with games serving as occasions to reassert those identities. At the 2012 Copa del Rey final between Athletic Bilbao (which only signs players born or reared in the Basque region) and Barcelona (which is closely linked to Catalonia), followers of both teams jeered and whistled the two main symbols of Spain: the king and the national anthem. Still, a month later, each club provided players to the Spanish national team, which went off to defend its European championship.Spain\u2019s recent run of success, fueled by an extraordinary generation of players, took place amid a staggering economic crisis that has only increased separatist fervor. The success has served as a challenge to soccer regionalism, but it also owes a debt to a remarkable human story that has kept regional tensions from dividing the team: the friendship between the leaders of the country\u2019s two most famous clubs, Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas and Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez.CLASSIC GOAL2010SPAIN vs. THE NETHERLANDS14 IniestaIniestaIniestavan der vaartF\u00c0bregas2F\u00c0bregasTorres3The two had excelled together since childhood on Spain\u2019s youth and senior national teams, and their friendship prevailed in the worst moments of the rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona, including a 2011 Cl\u00e1sico encounter during which coaches on opposing sides nearly came to blows. After that game, Casillas phoned Xavi to find a way for the players to defuse the smoldering feud that risked fracturing the Spanish team. Sadly, Casillas paid a heavy price; his coach removed him from the Madrid lineup for his \u201cdisloyalty.\u201d But a year later, Spain\u2019s players \u2014 the Catalans, the Basques and all the rest \u2014 came together to win their second consecutive European championship. Another key element in maintaining that team unity has been Spain\u2019s coach, Vicente del Bosque. A quietly brilliant, modest, mustachioed man of somewhat dour countenance, he is known for his composure and politeness on the sideline and for his calm management of a collection of scintillating talent and powerful egos. The in-house style of play he has inherited and fostered allows the diminutive Spanish players to dominate their larger, stronger opponents though a fluid style that combines relentless pressure and high-tempo, precision passing. Spain plays as if it has no stars; it is the triumph of the collective. But the success of players\u2019 transcending their competing regional identities also provides a template for Spaniards facing these divides in their daily lives. The peace brokered by Xavi and Casillas, along with the selfless play managed by del Bosque\u2019s steady hand, suggests ways for the country to navigate the regionalism and economic distress that are taxing Spain\u2019s identity and threatening its future.Can this spirit survive the departures of some of the team\u2019s top players after the World Cup \u2014 including, perhaps, two friends from mutually wary regions of Spain? Can this attitude survive a World Cup loss? We\u2019ll be watching in Brazil, particularly after Spain's disastrous start to the tournament, a 5-1 loss to the Netherlands in which Casillas and the heroes of a golden generation showed little of the team spirit that has driven Spain in recent years.Luis Garicano is a professor of economics and strategy at the London School of Economics and the author of \u201cEl Dilema de Espa\u00f1a.\u201dMy Travels with the Curse of Maraca\u00f1aLive Coverage of the World Cup 2014World Cup Stars in (Super Slow) MotionAn article on Monday about Brazilian soccer style misspelled the surname of the historian who noted that mass culture was becoming more North American or provincial, with the exception of the Brazilian national soccer team.

That is the lowest level since 1997 and that which the Japanese central bank says is near full employment. The jobless rate was 3.6 percent in April. At the same time, the availability of jobs rose to its highest level since 1992, which is encouraging news for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he tries to cement a recovery after two decades of stagnation.The strong employment numbers were published alongside other data on Friday showing that the core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes the volatile prices of fresh food, rose 3.4 percent in the year to May, matching the median forecast of economists surveyed by Reuters. The sales tax increase pushed up prices across the board for the fastest rise since April 1982.Excluding the tax increase, core consumer inflation stood at 1.4 percent, slower than the 1.5 percent annual increase in the previous month, mainly because of the fading effects of the weak yen and a rise last year in electricity bills. The slight decrease was in line with the Japanese central bank\u2019s projection that price gains would slow for a few months before accelerating again late this year. The Bank of Japan estimated that the sales tax increase \u2014 it rose to 8 percent from 5 percent on April 1 \u2014 would add 1.7 percentage points to annual consumer inflation in April and two percentage points from May onward. The central bank has also said that Japan is on track to meet its 2 percent inflation target next year, although it projects that consumer inflation will hover just above 1 percent for several months.Japan\u2019s household spending fell 8 percent in the year to May, the government said Friday, four times the drop projected in a median market forecast and more than the 4.6 percent decline in April. The tumble mainly reflected a pulling back in spending on housing, cars and household appliances, all of which underwent a surge in demand before the sales tax increase. Households spent more on items like television sets, personal computers and clothing in May. Spending on eating out also stopped falling.\u201cThe decline in household spending is too large to ignore, but if you exclude auto sales, there are signs that spending is bottoming out,\u201d said Hiroshi Miyazaki, a senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. \u201cIt may take a little longer for spending to recover,\u201d he added, \u201cbut there\u2019s no need to turn pessimistic on the economy.\u201dAnalysts say they expect the economy to contract in the second quarter. Weak spending could make the contraction worse, they say, although the strong job market and an expected increase in summer bonus payments will underpin spending.\u201cA contraction in the second quarter is a certainty, but the job market improvements are positive for the economy,\u201d said Yoshiki Shinke, the chief economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.The data are unlikely to change dominant market expectations that the central bank will hold off on further monetary stimulus for the rest of this year, analysts said, and the central bank has signaled that it sees no immediate need to expand the already huge stimulus program deployed in April 2013.Advertisement"}

Officials at the central bank have acknowledged worries about low inflation for months but have been reluctant to do anything about it until this week. The latest steps are designed to pump more money into the economy, but only modest results can be expected. For instance, the negative interest rate on deposits at the central bank is meant to discourage banks from parking too much money with the central bank instead of lending it to businesses and consumers \u2014 a longstanding problem. If the central bank had taken the same actions earlier, there could have been a bigger impact, but that\u2019s hard to know. What we do know is that weaker euro economies desperately need more help.Ideally, governments would provide stimulus with increased spending on public services. Yet most euro countries are doing the opposite. They are cutting spending and increasing taxes to conform with the austerity policies demanded by Germany and the European Union.

{"Headline": "Beating of Roma Boy Exposes Tensions in France\u2019s Underclass", "Date": "2014-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPIERREFITTE-SUR-SEINE, France \u2014 With its bleak concrete apartment blocks and clutches of bored, jobless young men, the Cit\u00e9 des Po\u00e8tes housing project defies its idyllic name.It was here this month in this poor, largely immigrant suburb north of Paris that a 17-year-old Roma boy, Gheorghe, known as Darius, was beaten unconscious by a gang of as many as 20 young men wielding wooden and metal sticks, according to prosecutors. His limp body was dumped in a shopping cart, and his swollen face frozen into a mask of pain.Darius, a Romanian citizen, remains in a coma in critical condition. Nearly two weeks after the attack, no arrests have been made in a crime whose sheer brutality has shocked France, drawing condemnation from President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who called it \u201cbeyond words and unjustifiable.\u201dProsecutors and witnesses say the attack was carried out in retribution for the young man\u2019s suspected thievery from the nearby housing project. While they have not characterized the attack as racially motivated, prosecutors said it was no ordinary crime, but a veritable lynching on the outskirts of Paris in an increasingly inhospitable climate for minority groups, here and across Europe, particularly for the Roma.Not least, it highlighted the tensions in France\u2019s economic underclass. The Roma, who set up camps on the poor fringes of French cities, are clashing with longtime resident immigrants who are struggling to integrate themselves and have lived impoverished for decades in the suburbs that ring Paris and other cities, known as the banlieues.In the case of Darius, whose full name has not been revealed by the authorities because he is a minor, the rage of an underclass living on the margins of the French capital appears to have turned the miserable against the desperate.\u201cThose who live here are losers, the majority don\u2019t work, and then these people dare to settle near here,\u201d said Aka, 45, who like most residents declined to give his last name for fear of retribution from other residents. As a group of Roma rummaged through the garbage for scrap metal near his building complex, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s poor picking on poor. They come into our homes and wreck, steal and vandalize. It\u2019s an outrage.\u201dWithin days after the Roma set up a makeshift camp last month near the housing project across the street from a highway, residents said they woke up to find car seats missing. Jewelry, televisions and stereos vanished, they said. But no one called the police, a measure of the deep distrust of the authorities shared by both the Roma and residents.Daya, 14, a student, who said she had witnessed the onset of the attack, said the housing projects had their own internal justice system. She said the local young men formed a gang that took matters into its own hands, not bothering to notify the police. \u201cIf you call them, they will target you, so we don\u2019t bother,\u201d she said.Bader, 15, a student, added, \u201cWe never see the police here.\u201dOn June 13, the night of the attack, there were two robberies at the housing projects, prosecutors and witnesses said. During the second robbery, a youth fitting Darius\u2019s description \u2014 wearing jogging pants and a red T-shirt \u2014 was spotted trying to rob an apartment but managed to escape. He had been caught stealing before, residents said.Daya said she was coming home from a basketball game when she saw about 20 men heading toward the Roma camp, wielding clubs. She said the men came from Cit\u00e9 des Po\u00e8tes as well as from a neighboring housing project. At least one was armed, prosecutors said.When Darius\u2019s grandmother tried to stop the gang, they beat her, witnesses said. Then they took him across railroad tracks to the basement of an apartment, where they beat him nearly to death.After Darius was taken, his mother received a call from Darius\u2019s cellphone from the kidnappers, who demanded a ransom of 15,000 euros, or more than $20,000. Eventually, this was lowered to \u20ac5,000. The French daily newspaper Le Monde reported that the kidnappers had threatened to decapitate Darius.Ion Vardu Sandu, 49, a Roma mechanic whose shop borders the Roma camp and who employs neighborhood youths, said Darius\u2019s family had offered to return the jewelry he had stolen. Instead, he found Darius\u2019s almost lifeless body on the side of the road.\u201cHe was barely breathing, and his eyes were closed,\u201d Mr. Sandu said. \u201cIt was not a racist crime. This Darius was the No. 1 thief in Romania. He comes here and steals, and makes a bad image for the rest of us.\u201dAfter Darius was attacked, the 150 or so Roma living near the projects fled. Today the Roma camp\u2019s nearly 40 makeshift houses are abandoned. Piles of garbage and clothes remain, along with toys, cartons of uneaten pasta and bags of baguettes.Investigators say they have had a hard time catching those responsible, in part because the Roma, conditioned by persecution, have offered contradictory witness statements, for fear of being prosecuted themselves.The Roma, who were rounded up and sent to death camps along with Jews by the Nazis during World War II, have long struggled to overcome a legacy of persecution. Descended from Indians, the Roma have for generations remained impoverished and virtually nomadic, living on the fringes of society.A majority of France\u2019s roughly 20,000 noncitizen Roma come from Romania and Bulgaria, two of the newest and poorest European Union members, whose citizens were granted full freedom of movement to live and work this year.Despite Mr. Hollande\u2019s condemnation of the attack, his Socialist government has accelerated the destruction of Roma camps, and some critics blame it for legitimizing a climate of hatred against the Roma fanned by the extreme right. His recently appointed prime minister, Manuel Valls, said last year that only a minority of Roma could integrate, suggesting that they should leave.In May, the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, the National Front, came in first in elections for the European Parliament, running an anti-immigration campaign that resonated strongly in France\u2019s flat economy. The party had warned that the country risked being flooded by Roma, and last year, its founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, called the Roma population in Nice \u201csmelly\u201d and \u201crash-inducing.\u201dDarius had escaped from a mental hospital in Romania before coming to France, the authorities said, and he appears to fit a pattern of many young Roma living in the country. Roma advocates said that after fleeing Romania, he joined his mother and his grandmother in France. His father is still in Romania. Darius did not attend school and had been arrested on suspicion of burglary at least once, without being charged, prosecutors said. His mother was unemployed.Children like Darius are being shunned by public schools wary of legitimizing the Roma camps where they lived, she said. \u201cWe are losing a generation of children,\u201d she said.In the Cit\u00e9 des Po\u00e8tes, young people said they, too, felt abandoned by the French state. About 900 housing projects were built from the 1970s to the 1990s with the aim of housing working-class and immigrant populations, many from north and sub-Saharan Africa. Unemployment in the projects is up to 30 percent, said Beno\u00eet M\u00e9nard, of the mayor\u2019s office in Pierrefitte-sur-Seine. A third of the population was born outside France, according to the National Statistics Institute.The Cit\u00e9 des Po\u00e8tes is undergoing an extensive renovation, with the installation of modernist orange balconies on some buildings and gardens. But residents said the renovations were all gloss.\u201cThere is no cinema, no pool, no football stadium,\u201d said Bader, 15, the student, sitting with friends. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have jobs or money, and so they steal or sell drugs. They don\u2019t look to do anything else. Here we have nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Out of Power Almost 7 Years, Blair Is Still Haunted by a Legacy of War", "Date": "2014-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Twiggy Garcia, a part-time bartender, had talked with friends about making a citizen\u2019s arrest if he ever got near Tony Blair, the former prime minister who led Britain into war in Iraq. But he never seriously imagined it happening.\u201cThen one day he just appeared,\u201d said Mr. Garcia, who was making cocktails at the Tramshed restaurant in London this year when Mr. Blair arrived to eat.Mr. Garcia put his hand on Mr. Blair\u2019s shoulder and announced a citizen\u2019s arrest for crimes against peace. Mr. Blair, having experienced something similar four times previously, did not seem that surprised. \u201cHe had a look of \u2018Here we go again\u2019 plastered over his face,\u201d Mr. Garcia said.Mr. Blair led his Labour Party into power in 1997 in a landslide victory and was prime minister for a decade, winning two more general elections along the way. He pulled Labour toward the political center, helped negotiate a peace deal in Northern Ireland and presided over a generally healthy economy.But now, out of power for almost seven years, he remains defined in many Britons\u2019 eyes by one issue: his steadfast support for the United States and President George W. Bush in the Iraq war, a decision that isolated him from much of his party and continues to haunt his legacy, especially with Iraq now fracturing into sectarian violence.It is \u201ca bizarre reading of the cauldron that is the Middle East today,\u201d Mr. Blair said, \u201cto claim that but for the removal of Saddam, we would not have a crisis. And it is here that if we want the right policy for the future, we have to learn properly the lessons not just of Iraq in 2003 but of the Arab uprisings from 2011 onwards.\u201cThe reality is that the whole of the Middle East and beyond is going through a huge, agonising and protracted transition,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have to liberate ourselves from the notion that \u2018we\u2019 have caused this. We haven\u2019t. We can argue as to whether our policies at points have helped or not; and whether action or inaction is the best policy and there is a lot to be said on both sides. But the fundamental cause of the crisis lies within the region not outside it.\u201dMr. Blair\u2019s analysis did little to convince his critics, the most vociferous of whom have long demanded that he face war crimes charges.\u201cI think there is something about Blair that really makes a red mist descend upon people who would otherwise be able to judge more objectively,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.Mr. Blair\u2019s friends say they are baffled by the ferocity of his critics. \u201cThere is something unfair and unreasonable and irrational about it,\u201d said Alastair Campbell, once Mr. Blair\u2019s spokesman, who said his former boss is judged by different standards from those applied to other ex-leaders.Mr. Blair suggested that his most outspoken opponents did not represent public opinion. Speaking to reporters in his office in Mayfair recently after a speech about Europe, he defended his record in and out of office and played down episodes like the \u201ccitizen\u2019s arrest\u201d encounters.He said it was wrong to assume that someone \u201cwho comes up to you and wants to make a name for himself represents the whole of the people.\u201d\u201cIn that restaurant you had him, you also had a lot of the tables which I would go around and talk to people \u2014 and people were perfectly friendly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I said, I won three elections. I didn\u2019t lose them.\u201dHe traced some of the criticism to his tortured relationship with the British press, parts of which he once likened to a \u201cferal beast.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always had this problem with sections of the British media,\u201d said Mr. Blair, looking tanned, wearing an open-neck shirt and drinking coffee (which he had given up while in power).\u201cI still think that there is basic support for that center-ground, progressive British politics, irrespective of whatever attacks there are on me personally,\u201d he said.Mr. Blair is the Middle Eastern envoy of the \u201cquartet\u201d of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia. He has started arguing publicly for Britain to remain within the European Union, and campaigns for action against climate change. He runs a number of charitable initiatives, including the Africa Governance Initiative, the Tony Blair Faith Foundation and a sports foundation, and a lobbying operation, Tony Blair Associates, which has advised controversial clients, including the Kazakhstan government.But for many, his record is defined by unpopular wars in Afghanistan and Iraq \u2014 the latter justified partly by claims, later proved incorrect, that Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime had weapons of mass destruction.A British inquiry into the Iraq war, established in 2009, is yet to report, and recently announced that it will publish only parts of correspondence between London and Washington. Even so, it could pose another threat to Mr. Blair\u2019s reputation.In Britain, former prime ministers enjoy less automatic respect than, for example, former presidents of the United States.And Mr. Blair, now 61, quit government while relatively young. \u201cYou find this more and more with leaders who leave when they are in their early 50s,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was never any way I was going to retire and play golf.\u201dMr. Blair\u2019s critics come both from the left of his own Labour Party, which resented his backing for Mr. Bush and his shift toward the ideological middle, and the right, where elements of the Conservative Party disliked Mr. Blair\u2019s support for European integration and later judged him as hypocritical for cultivating the rich and powerful.His controversial friends have included Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister; Rebekah Brooks, the former newspaper editor and executive; and Wendi Deng, the ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch. Over the years Mr. Blair\u2019s wife, Cherie, a prominent lawyer, has also attracted her share of media criticism.Professor Bale said Mr. Blair\u2019s religious beliefs (he converted to Catholicism after leaving 10 Downing Street) exposed another flank to critics.\u201cHe had this slightly preachy, evangelical side to his character, which leaves him open to the charge of hypocrisy when he serves Mammon as well as God,\u201d Professor Bale said.Reports that Mr. Blair\u2019s wealth amounts to 100 million pounds, or $170 million, may be an underestimate, the article said.Mr. Blair denied that. \u201cI\u2019m not worth 100 million, a half of it, a third of it, a quarter of it or a fifth of it or really a fraction,\u201d he said.He could make much more money were that his objective, he said. However, he needs finances for his foundations, which employ more than 200 people, he added.\u201cThe business side we do is both interesting and fascinating, but also necessary to build the whole infrastructure. So I think at some point people will understand what I\u2019m trying to do, which is about making a difference and not making money,\u201d Mr. Blair said, sounding slightly defensive.But so reviled is Mr. Blair in some quarters that a website, set up by the writer George Monbiot, offers cash to those who attempt a citizen\u2019s arrest on the former prime minister.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Coming Climate Crash", "Date": "2014-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionTHERE is a time for weighing evidence and a time for acting. And if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned throughout my work in finance, government and conservation, it is to act before problems become too big to manage.For too many years, we failed to rein in the excesses building up in the nation\u2019s financial markets. When the credit bubble burst in 2008, the damage was devastating. Millions suffered. Many still do.This is a crisis we can\u2019t afford to ignore. I feel as if I\u2019m watching as we fly in slow motion on a collision course toward a giant mountain. We can see the crash coming, and yet we\u2019re sitting on our hands rather than altering course.We need to act now, even though there is much disagreement, including from members of my own Republican Party, on how to address this issue while remaining economically competitive. They\u2019re right to consider the economic implications. But we must not lose sight of the profound economic risks of doing nothing.The solution can be a fundamentally conservative one that will empower the marketplace to find the most efficient response. We can do this by putting a price on emissions of carbon dioxide \u2014 a carbon tax. Few in the United States now pay to emit this potent greenhouse gas into the atmosphere we all share. Putting a price on emissions will create incentives to develop new, cleaner energy technologies.It\u2019s true that the United States can\u2019t solve this problem alone. But we\u2019re not going to be able to persuade other big carbon polluters to take the urgent action that\u2019s needed if we\u2019re not doing everything we can do to slow our carbon emissions and mitigate our risks.I was secretary of the Treasury when the credit bubble burst, so I think it\u2019s fair to say that I know a little bit about risk, assessing outcomes and problem-solving. Looking back at the dark days of the financial crisis in 2008, it is easy to see the similarities between the financial crisis and the climate challenge we now face.We are building up excesses (debt in 2008, greenhouse gas emissions that are trapping heat now). Our government policies are flawed (incentivizing us to borrow too much to finance homes then, and encouraging the overuse of carbon-based fuels now). Our experts (financial experts then, climate scientists now) try to understand what they see and to model possible futures. And the outsize risks have the potential to be tremendously damaging (to a globalized economy then, and the global climate now).Back then, we narrowly avoided an economic catastrophe at the last minute by rescuing a collapsing financial system through government action. But climate change is a more intractable problem. The carbon dioxide we\u2019re sending into the atmosphere remains there for centuries, heating up the planet.That means the decisions we\u2019re making today \u2014 to continue along a path that\u2019s almost entirely carbon-dependent \u2014 are locking us in for long-term consequences that we will not be able to change but only adapt to, at enormous cost. To protect New York City from rising seas and storm surges is expected to cost at least $20 billion initially, and eventually far more. And that\u2019s just one coastal city.New York can reasonably predict those obvious risks. When I worry about risks, I worry about the biggest ones, particularly those that are difficult to predict \u2014 the ones I call small but deep holes. While odds are you will avoid them, if you do fall in one, it\u2019s a long way down and nearly impossible to claw your way out.Scientists have identified a number of these holes \u2014 potential thresholds that, once crossed, could cause sweeping, irreversible changes. They don\u2019t know exactly when we would reach them. But they know we should do everything we can to avoid them.Already, observations are catching up with years of scientific models, and the trends are not in our favor.Fewer than 10 years ago, the best analysis projected that melting Arctic sea ice would mean nearly ice-free summers by the end of the 21st century. Now the ice is melting so rapidly that virtually ice-free Arctic summers could be here in the next decade or two. The lack of reflective ice will mean that more of the sun\u2019s heat will be absorbed by the oceans, accelerating warming of both the oceans and the atmosphere, and ultimately raising sea levels.It is true that there is uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of these risks and many others. But those who claim the science is unsettled or action is too costly are simply trying to ignore the problem. We must see the bigger picture.The nature of a crisis is its unpredictability. And as we all witnessed during the financial crisis, a chain reaction of cascading failures ensued from one intertwined part of the system to the next. It\u2019s easy to see a single part in motion. It\u2019s not so easy to calculate the resulting domino effect. That sort of contagion nearly took down the global financial system.With that experience indelibly affecting my perspective, viewing climate change in terms of risk assessment and risk management makes clear to me that taking a cautiously conservative stance \u2014 that is, waiting for more information before acting \u2014 is actually taking a very radical risk. We\u2019ll never know enough to resolve all of the uncertainties. But we know enough to recognize that we must act now.I\u2019m a businessman, not a climatologist. But I\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of time with climate scientists and economists who have devoted their careers to this issue. There is virtually no debate among them that the planet is warming and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible.Farseeing business leaders are already involved in this issue. It\u2019s time for more to weigh in. To add reliable financial data to the science, I\u2019ve joined with the former mayor of New York City, Michael R. Bloomberg, and the retired hedge fund manager Tom Steyer on an economic analysis of the costs of inaction across key regions and economic sectors. Our goal for the Risky Business project \u2014 starting with a new study that will be released this week \u2014 is to influence business and investor decision making worldwide.We need to craft national policy that uses market forces to provide incentives for the technological advances required to address climate change. As I\u2019ve said, we can do this by placing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. Many respected economists, of all ideological persuasions, support this approach. We can debate the appropriate pricing and policy design and how to use the money generated. But a price on carbon would change the behavior of both individuals and businesses. At the same time, all fossil fuel \u2014 and renewable energy \u2014 subsidies should be phased out. Renewable energy can outcompete dirty fuels once pollution costs are accounted for.Some members of my political party worry that pricing carbon is a \u201cbig government\u201d intervention. In fact, it will reduce the role of government, which, on our present course, increasingly will be called on to help communities and regions affected by climate-related disasters like floods, drought-related crop failures and extreme weather like tornadoes, hurricanes and other violent storms. We\u2019ll all be paying those costs. Not once, but many times over.This is already happening, with taxpayer dollars rebuilding homes damaged by Hurricane Sandy and the deadly Oklahoma tornadoes. This is a proper role of government. But our failure to act on the underlying problem is deeply misguided, financially and logically.In a future with more severe storms, deeper droughts, longer fire seasons and rising seas that imperil coastal cities, public funding to pay for adaptations and disaster relief will add significantly to our fiscal deficit and threaten our long-term economic security. So it is perverse that those who want limited government and rail against bailouts would put the economy at risk by ignoring climate change.This is short-termism. There is a tendency, particularly in government and politics, to avoid focusing on difficult problems until they balloon into crisis. We would be fools to wait for that to happen to our climate.When you run a company, you want to hand it off in better shape than you found it. In the same way, just as we shouldn\u2019t leave our children or grandchildren with mountains of national debt and unsustainable entitlement programs, we shouldn\u2019t leave them with the economic and environmental costs of climate change. Republicans must not shrink from this issue. Risk management is a conservative principle, as is preserving our natural environment for future generations. We are, after all, the party of Teddy Roosevelt.THIS problem can\u2019t be solved without strong leadership from the developing world. The key is cooperation between the United States and China \u2014 the two biggest economies, the two biggest emitters of carbon dioxide and the two biggest consumers of energy.When it comes to developing new technologies, no country can innovate like America. And no country can test new technologies and roll them out at scale quicker than China.The two nations must come together on climate. The Paulson Institute at the University of Chicago, a \u201cthink-and-do tank\u201d I founded to help strengthen the economic and environmental relationship between these two countries, is focused on bridging this gap.We already have a head start on the technologies we need. The costs of the policies necessary to make the transition to an economy powered by clean energy are real, but modest relative to the risks.A tax on carbon emissions will unleash a wave of innovation to develop technologies, lower the costs of clean energy and create jobs as we and other nations develop new energy products and infrastructure. This would strengthen national security by reducing the world\u2019s dependence on governments like Russia and Iran.Climate change is the challenge of our time. Each of us must recognize that the risks are personal. We\u2019ve seen and felt the costs of underestimating the financial bubble. Let\u2019s not ignore the climate bubble.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Wichita, Koch Influence Is Revered and Reviled", "Date": "2014-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWICHITA, Kan. \u2014 In national politics, playing in Charles Koch\u2019s arena can mean saturation advertising against vulnerable Democrats, calls for tax cuts, demands to roll back government regulation and bitter clashes over climate change.\u201cI would be hard-pressed to find two things that are more important to this community than Koch Industries and Shocker basketball,\u201d said Gregg Marshall, coach of the Wichita State University men\u2019s team, which packs the arena, a house that Mr. Koch restored with his donations. \u201cThey put a nice chunk of change into this building.\u201dWelcome to Kochville, where the family name conjures up something decidedly different from the specter raised by Democrats of secretive political operations funded by tens of millions of dollars in anonymous campaign money. For many living here in Wichita along the Arkansas River, it stands instead for well-paying jobs, extensive philanthropy like the $6 million for the arena renovation, and Kansas pride in being the headquarters of Koch Industries, the nation\u2019s second-largest privately held company, which produces oil, fertilizer and common household items.Outside of Kochville, the brothers Charles and David Koch, whose worth is estimated at more than $50 billion each, are ready villains. Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader, regularly skewers them on the Senate floor. Others have proposed a constitutional amendment aimed at diluting their influence. The two are even the subject of an updated documentary titled \u201cKoch Brothers Exposed: 2014 Edition.\u201dBut the charged atmosphere surrounding the Kochs elsewhere dissipates markedly in the city where their father, Fred Koch, started his business in 1925, even though the positive sentiment toward the Kochs is hardly universally shared.The Kochs\u2019 reach in the city \u2014 once known as Cowtown because of its history as a railhead for Texas cattle drives and later called America\u2019s Air Capital for its private aircraft manufacturing industry \u2014 extends far beyond the arena and company headquarters now expanding in the northeast corner of the city.The Kochs contribute generously to Big Brothers Big Sisters, the Salvation Army and smaller community endeavors. The company\u2019s 3,500 jobs, regular employment opportunities and growth have meant steady paychecks in Wichita while other important and historic sectors of the local economy have struggled. The company estimated its direct payments in salary and benefits to Kansas workers, most of them in Wichita, at $410 million last year.\u201cThere is almost no one in town who doesn\u2019t have a friend, a neighbor, a relative who works out at Koch,\u201d said Mary Beth Jarvis, a former Koch executive who oversees the organization that puts on the city\u2019s annual river festival and the accompanying symphony concert, which has long been underwritten by the Koch family.Since 2000, organizations affiliated with the Koch family or company have given more than $50 million to Wichita and Kansas nonprofit groups, according to a company tally. Charles Koch lives in Wichita, and David lives in New York City, where he is also a donor to the arts and medicine.While such strong community support has dazzled some residents, others see the Koch activities as insidious, an attempt to buy good will while the two brothers and their political allies spend much more behind the scenes to dismantle bedrock government programs more important to the average Kansan.\u201cThat is all just bells and whistles, the shiny little things to distract you while they are proceeding to try to change our country into what they want it to be,\u201d said Randy Mousley, president of the Wichita teachers\u2019 union. He has clashed with Koch-backed groups and legislators over deep income and business tax cuts that reduced state aid for education and forced some districts to eliminate staff and raise property taxes.\u201cThe Kochs are using their money and influence to hold our community hostage,\u201d said Louis Goseland, the campaign director for Kansas People\u2019s Action, a progressive activist group in Wichita that is also battling the Koch political agenda. \u201cRight now we are working under Koch rule.\u201dKoch officials dismiss such ideas as far-fetched. They say Koch contributions to Wichita are a way of repaying a city that has made it possible for both the Koch company and family to thrive because of its entrepreneurial spirit and available work force.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do it just as protection money or whatever you call it,\u201d said Mark V. Holden, senior vice president and general counsel for Koch Industries. \u201cIt is not just about the business doing well. We are trying to get involved in issues and in places, particularly in this, our hometown, where we can make a difference.\u201dAmplifying the company\u2019s influence, many former executives such as Ms. Jarvis, schooled in the Koch way, move on from the company to play leadership roles at other organizations in and around Wichita. Koch officials, present and former, sit on boards throughout the community.\u201cI don\u2019t think there has been a time since \u201995 that we have not had somebody from Koch Industries at an upper level on our board,\u201d said Mark C. Reed, director of the zoo, who noted that it recently hosted the company\u2019s annual picnic for 4,000 employees and their families.The philanthropic hand of the family was not always so visible as the Kochs used to shy away from recognition and kept their giving more low key. But escalating negative attention from a series of court fights and their rising conservative activism have spurred a more public role over the years, though Charles Koch only reluctantly let his name be affixed to the arena, officials said.The company last week began a national advertising campaign around the theme \u201cWe Are Koch,\u201d emphasizing that Koch Industries was \u201cstarted in the heartland\u201d and had ample job opportunities.The expansive local footprint of the company has left Koch critics to tread lightly. Mr. Mousley said he avoided the subject of the Kochs during family gatherings since his brother and sister-in-law work for Koch Industries. Some Wichita business owners and officials said they were reluctant to discuss the company\u2019s local reach for fear of losing business or good relations with neighbors.Even Kansas People\u2019s Action chose to participate in a protest outside the Koch office in Washington rather than Wichita, where the company expansion and relocation of a major road (paid for entirely by the company) have pushed the public perimeter away from the office tower. Mr. Holden said the addition should enhance security around the headquarters after threats against the Kochs and their business. The company would not disclose the cost of the addition, intended to accommodate 745 employees, but the entire project is believed to have a price tag in excess of $100 million.Mr. Holden said strong emotions had been stirred against the family since it escalated its political activities, citing the 2010 midterm elections as a turning point.\u201cI attribute a lot of that venom and invective and all that to the national political theater in which we\u2019re living now,\u201d said Mr. Holden, who added that Democrats, led by Mr. Reid, had seized on the Kochs as a convenient foil and fund-raising tool. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a bogyman like they do when there is a Republican presidential candidate, and so they have decided we are going to play that role.\u201dAs for those living in Wichita, the Koch dominance distresses some.\u201cMy daughter, who just graduated from W.S.U., was telling me: \u2018Mom, what\u2019s here? The biggest thing you can aspire to do is work for the Koch brothers, and I don\u2019t want to do that,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Sulma Arias, the executive director of Kansas People\u2019s Action.Others cannot reconcile the image of the Kochs as a sinister political force with their impression of Charles Koch as a regular guy who shows up at Shocker games with his family and meets once a year with Mr. Marshall, the coach, for a \u201cstate of the program\u201d discussion.\u201cYou see the name of our arena, so that sort of sums things up real quick,\u201d said Ron Baker, a Kansas native and star guard for the Shockers. \u201cI\u2019ve never met the guy, but I heard good things of him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Crop losses that used to happen only once every 20 years because of cataclysmic weather will occur five times as often.The report is aimed squarely at corporate America, offering the kind of risk modeling a financial firm might make to assess the probable impact of a changing climate on an investment portfolio whose \u201cassets\u201d included farming, housing, labor productivity and crime.For starters, it seems clear by now that the world\u2019s temperature will almost certainly rise more than two degrees Celsius \u2014 or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 above the average of the late 19th century, a ceiling that the world\u2019s leaders have repeatedly promised never to breach and a point at which climate-related risks rise even more sharply.Second, despite the rising awareness of the risks caused by our unrestrained consumption of fossil fuels, there is no evidence that we plan to break the habit and leave a substantial portion of the Earth\u2019s oil, gas and coal in the ground.\u201cWe are swinging to fossil fuels in ways that couldn\u2019t have been imagined a few years ago,\u201d said Michael Greenstone of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cWe\u2019ve made substantial progress in renewables, but there\u2019s been even more innovation in fossil fuels. Incentives to invest in low-carbon energy are going down.\u201d\u201cThe economic benefits of mitigation do not start to be felt until midcentury and are most obvious in the second half of the century,\u201d notes the report. Under the most pessimistic forecast \u2014 in which we do nothing to burn fewer fossil fuels \u2014 the average global temperature rises up to 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit over the next five to 25 years. Under the most optimistic, it rises about 1.6 degrees.Reducing carbon emissions now is about helping prevent even more serious damage 50, 75 and 100 years from today. To address the more immediate risks, notes Trevor Houser, who heads the energy practice at the Rhodium Group, the economic modeling firm that performed the risk analysis for the Risky Business report, the best we can do is \u201cinvest in adaptation.\u201dWhat to do with this awareness? Homeowners in New York\u2019s Red Hook and Coney Island neighborhoods should probably consider waterproofing, as both will fall into the one-in-100-year flood area over the next 25 years. Hospitals in the Southeast might want to staff up. The federal government may want to consider what will happen to the budget when it is left to reconstruct every city that gets pounded by a hurricane, not to mention the higher costs of heavily subsidized crop and flood insurance.But there is more to be gained. A more realistic, detailed and nuanced assessment of both the damages that await us might allow for a more effective response.Two degrees or bust not only commits the world to a probably unattainable goal, it promotes despondency once it becomes obvious we won\u2019t meet it.By contrast, the Risky Business analysis, which dispassionately lays out damages to specific places and economic sectors along a probability curve as the temperature rises well past two degrees, allows for the kind of cost-benefit assessment that could mobilize effective action.By the final decades of the century, Nebraska will face a one-in-20 chance that climate change will reduce its agricultural production by almost $2,000 for each man, woman and child in the state. North Dakota will face a one-in-20 chance that declining productivity will cost the state $1,600 per person, as workers stay indoors out of the sun. Arizona will face one-in-20 odds that energy costs will rise by $800 per person.These odds are easier to understand than the panel on climate change\u2019s abstract, abstruse estimate that keeping the temperature from increasing more than two degrees Celsius above the preindustrial era will cost up to 11 percent of consumption by 2100, in a world economy that would be three to nine times as large as today\u2019s.The question, for corporate chieftains, business leaders and voters remains: What is it worth to prevent these costs?But don\u2019t hold your breath.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Ukraine Announces Cease-Fire, White House Points Finger at Russia", "Date": "2014-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On a day that the Ukrainian government announced a unilateral cease-fire in its battle with separatists in the country\u2019s east, the Obama administration raised the stakes with Russia on Friday, accusing the Kremlin of continuing to covertly arm the rebels.A spokesman for the Ukrainian military, Vladislav Seleznyov, said the cease-fire would begin at 10 p.m. local time on Friday. Ukraine\u2019s new president, Petro O. Poroshenko, has stressed that the plan hinges on the sealing of the porous border with Russia, to prevent the flow of fighters and arms.There was no immediate reaction from separatist leaders, but the Kremlin issued an angry statement complaining about artillery fire that struck a Russian border post, with demands for an investigation and an apology. \u201cThe statement by the president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, on the temporary cessation of hostilities was accidentally or deliberately made against the backdrop of shelling of Russian territory,\u201d the Kremlin said in its statement, adding that a building at the border post had been destroyed and a customs agent seriously injured. \u201cThe Russian side is waiting for an explanation and an apology,\u201d the Kremlin said, adding, about the cease-fire, \u201cThe initial analysis, unfortunately, shows that this is not an invitation to peace and negotiations but an ultimatum for the militias of southeast Ukraine to surrender.\u201d In addition, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, spoke by phone with the new Ukrainian foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, and Mr. Lavrov complained about demands that Russian tighten control of its border with Ukraine. Mr. Lavrov, in the call, again insisted that Russia did not control \u2014 or speak for \u2014 the separatist rebels. Russia\u2019s vehement reaction was somewhat surprising, given that the halt in military operations was part of a broader peace plan that Mr. Poroshenko has been developing in recent weeks in consultation with Russia and Western leaders.In Washington on Friday, American officials added another element to an increasingly complex situation, accusing Russia of working to undermine the prospects for peace even as President Vladimir V. Putin consulted with Mr. Poroshenko virtually daily on his peace proposal. President Obama warned Mr. Putin this month that the West would impose \u201cadditional costs\u201d on Russia if its provocations were to continue.\u201cWe have information that Russia has redeployed significant military forces to its border with Ukraine,\u201d a senior Obama administration official told reporters on Friday. \u201cRussian Special Forces are also maintaining points along the Ukrainian border to provide support to separatist fighters.\u201dAmerican officials said Russia was providing older weapons that its forces had phased out but that were known to remain in the Ukrainian military\u2019s inventory.\u201cThe desire here is to mask the Russian hand\u201d by allowing Ukrainian separatists to claim the weapons were captured on the battlefield, the administration official said. The official asked not to be identified by name, in line with the Obama administration\u2019s protocol for briefing reporters.Mr. Putin appears to be calculating that he can continue to provide military support to the separatists without triggering tough economic reprisals as long as the Kremlin denies that it is involved and avoids obvious provocations, like sending conventional Russian military units into eastern Ukraine, American officials said.The White House said Friday night that Mr. Obama had called Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, and that the three leaders had agreed the United States and the European Union would impose additional sanctions \u201cshould Russia fail to take immediate, concrete steps to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ukraine.\u201dBefore the cease-fire was announced, skirmishes for control of Krasny Liman, a railroad hub north of Donetsk, stretched into a second day. The Ukrainian military deployed both air and artillery strikes to oust pro-Russian separatist fighters, said Vladislav Seleznyov, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry.Mr. Seleznyov said seven government soldiers had been killed and 30 injured since fighting over a conduit road into the town began Thursday morning. He also said 300 rebel fighters had died in the fighting since Thursday, a figure that could not be independently verified. Mr. Seleznyov said the number was a \u201chard number,\u201d not propaganda. But that figure was far higher than those provided Thursday night by rebel forces, which said their number of dead and injured was in the single digits.Mr. Poroshenko had said he would call a unilateral cease-fire when he was ready to announce what has been advertised as a 14-point plan. Details from the initial draft that have leaked in the Ukrainian news media so far include some measure of decentralization, new elections and a more robust border with Russia.The fighting in Ukraine this week also prompted Mr. Putin to call Ms. Merkel Mr. Hollande to express his \u201cgrave concern\u201d about Ukraine\u2019s continuing military operations, the Kremlin news agency said. While denying any role in directing the separatist violence, Russia has acknowledged that it has forces near Ukraine\u2019s border.\u201cGiven the situation in the east, the tightening of Russian border security requires certain measures,\u201d Dmitry Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, told the Rossiya 24 cable news channel. \u201cThe armed forces are being called in.\u201dThe senior Obama administration official told reporters that some Russian forces near Ukraine had taken up positions that \u201care within a handful of kilometers of Ukrainian territory, the closest that they\u2019ve been since the invasion of Crimea.\u201d\u201cWe also have information that additional forces are due to arrive in coming weeks,\u201d the senior administration official added.An earlier version of the contributor list with this article misstated the middle initial of the contributor from Moscow.

{"Headline": "The Biology of Risk", "Date": "2014-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSIX years after the financial meltdown there is once again talk about market bubbles. Are stocks succumbing to exuberance? Is real estate? We thought we had exorcised these demons. It is therefore with something close to despair that we ask: What is it about risk taking that so eludes our understanding, and our control?Part of the problem is that we tend to view financial risk taking as a purely intellectual activity. But this view is incomplete. Risk is more than an intellectual puzzle \u2014 it is a profoundly physical experience, and it involves your body. Risk by its very nature threatens to hurt you, so when confronted by it your body and brain, under the influence of the stress response, unite as a single functioning unit. This occurs in athletes and soldiers, and it occurs as well in traders and people investing from home. The state of your body predicts your appetite for financial risk just as it predicts an athlete\u2019s performance.If we understand how a person\u2019s body influences risk taking, we can learn how to better manage risk takers. We can also recognize that mistakes governments have made have contributed to excessive risk taking.Consider the most important risk manager of them all \u2014 the Federal Reserve. Over the past 20 years, the Fed has pioneered a new technique of influencing Wall Street. Where before the Fed shrouded its activities in secrecy, it now informs the street in as clear terms as possible of what it intends to do with short-term interest rates, and when. Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, declared this new transparency, called forward guidance, a revolution; Ben S. Bernanke, her predecessor, claimed it reduced uncertainty and calmed the markets. But does it really calm the markets? Or has eliminating uncertainty in policy spread complacency among the financial community and actually helped inflate market bubbles?We get a fascinating answer to these questions if we turn from economics and look into the biology of risk taking.ONE biological mechanism, the stress response, exerts an especially powerful influence on risk taking. We live with stress daily, especially at work, yet few people truly understand what it is. Most of us tend to believe that stress is largely a psychological phenomenon, a state of being upset because something nasty has happened. But if you want to understand stress you must disabuse yourself of that view. The stress response is largely physical: It is your body priming itself for impending movement.As such, most stress is not, well, stressful. For example, when you walk to the coffee room at work, your muscles need fuel, so the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol recruit glucose from your liver and muscles; you need oxygen to burn this fuel, so your breathing increases ever so slightly; and you need to deliver this fuel and oxygen to cells throughout your body, so your heart gently speeds up and blood pressure increases. This suite of physical reactions forms the core of the stress response, and, as you can see, there is nothing nasty about it at all.Far from it. Many forms of stress, like playing sports, trading the markets, even watching an action movie, are highly enjoyable. In moderate amounts, we get a rush from stress, we thrive on risk taking. In fact, the stress response is such a healthy part of our lives that we should stop calling it stress at all and call it, say, the challenge response.This mechanism hums along, anticipating challenges, keeping us alive, and it usually does so without breaking the surface of consciousness. We take in information nonstop and our brain silently, behind the scenes, figures out what movement might be needed and then prepares our body. Many neuroscientists now believe our brain is designed primarily to plan and execute movement, that every piece of information we take in, every thought we think, comes coupled with some pattern of physical arousal. We do not process information as a computer does, dispassionately; we react to it physically. For humans, there is no pure thought of the kind glorified by Plato, Descartes and classical economics.Our challenge response, and especially its main hormone cortisol (produced by the adrenal glands) is particularly active when we are exposed to novelty and uncertainty. If a person is subjected to something mildly unpleasant, like bursts of white noise, but these are delivered at regular intervals, they may leave cortisol levels unaffected. But if the timing of the noise changes and it is delivered randomly, meaning it cannot be predicted, then cortisol levels rise significantly.Uncertainty over the timing of something unpleasant often causes a greater challenge response than the unpleasant thing itself. Sometimes it is more stressful not knowing when or if you are going to be fired than actually being fired. Why? Because the challenge response, like any good defense mechanism, anticipates; it is a metabolic preparation for the unknown.You may now have an inkling of just how central this biology is to the financial world. Traders are immersed in novelty and uncertainty the moment they step onto a trading floor. Here they encounter an information-rich environment like none other. Every event in the world, every piece of news, flows nonstop onto the floor, showing up on news feeds and market prices, blinking and disappearing. News by its very nature is novel, adds volatility to the market and puts us into a state of vigilance and arousal.I observed this remarkable call and echo between news and body when, after running a trading desk on Wall Street for 13 years, I returned to the University of Cambridge and began researching the neuroscience of trading.Most models in economics and finance assume that risk preferences are a stable trait, much like your height. But this assumption, as our studies suggest, is misleading. Humans are designed with shifting risk preferences. They are an integral part of our response to stress, or challenge.When opportunities abound, a potent cocktail of dopamine \u2014 a neurotransmitter operating along the pleasure pathways of the brain \u2014 and testosterone encourages us to expand our risk taking, a physical transformation I refer to as \u201cthe hour between dog and wolf.\u201d One such opportunity is a brief spike in market volatility, for this presents a chance to make money. But if volatility rises for a long period, the prolonged uncertainty leads us to subconsciously conclude that we no longer understand what is happening and then cortisol scales back our risk taking. In this way our risk taking calibrates to the amount of uncertainty and threat in the environment.Under conditions of extreme volatility, such as a crisis, traders, investors and indeed whole companies can freeze up in risk aversion, and this helps push a bear market into a crash. Unfortunately, this risk aversion occurs at just the wrong time, for these crises are precisely when markets offer the most attractive opportunities, and when the economy most needs people to take risks. The real challenge for Wall Street, I now believe, is not so much fear and greed as it is these silent and large shifts in risk appetite.I consult regularly with risk managers who must grapple with unstable risk taking throughout their organizations. Most of them are not aware that the source of the problem lurks deep in our bodies. Their attempts to manage risk are therefore comparable to firefighters\u2019 spraying water at the tips of flames.THE Fed, however, through its control of policy uncertainty, has in its hands a powerful tool for influencing risk takers. But by trying to be more transparent, it has relinquished this control.Forward guidance was introduced in the early 2000s. But the process of making monetary policy more transparent was in fact begun by Alan Greenspan back in the early 1990s. Before that time the Fed, especially under Paul A. Volcker, operated in secrecy. Fed chairmen did not announce rate changes, and they felt no need to explain themselves, leaving Wall Street highly uncertain about what was coming next. Furthermore, changes in interest rates were highly volatile: When Mr. Volcker raised rates, he might first raise them, cut them a few weeks later, and then raise again, so the tightening proceeded in a zigzag. Traders were put on edge, vigilant, never complacent about their positions so long as Mr. Volcker lurked in the shadows. Street wisdom has it that you don\u2019t fight the Fed, and no one tangled with that bruiser.Under Mr. Greenspan, the Fed became less intimidating and more transparent. Beginning in 1994 the Fed committed to changing fed funds only at its scheduled meetings (except in emergencies); it announced these changes at fixed times; and it communicated its easing or tightening bias. Mr. Greenspan notoriously spoke in riddles, but his actions had no such ambiguity. Mr. Bernanke reduced uncertainty even further: Forward guidance detailed the Fed\u2019s plans.Under both chairmen fed funds became far less erratic. Whereas Mr. Volcker changed rates in a volatile fashion, up one week down the next, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke raised them in regular steps. Between 2004 and 2006, rates rose .25 percent at every Fed meeting, without fail... tick, tick, tick. As a result of this more gradualist Fed, volatility in fed funds fell after 1994 by as much as 60 percent.Cycles of bubble and crash have always existed, but in the 20 years after 1994, they became more severe and longer lasting than in the previous 20 years. For example, the bear markets following the Nifty Fifty crash in the mid-70s and Black Monday of 1987 had an average loss of about 40 percent and lasted 240 days; while the dot-com and credit crises lost on average about 52 percent and lasted over 430 days. Moreover, if you rank the largest one-day percentage moves in the market over this 40-year period, 76 percent of the largest gains and losses occurred after 1994.I suspect the trends in fed funds and stocks were related. As uncertainty in fed funds declined, one of the most powerful brakes on excessive risk taking in stocks was released.During their tenures, in response to surging stock and housing markets, both Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke embarked on campaigns of tightening, but the metronome-like ticking of their rate increases was so soothing it failed to dampen exuberance.There are times when the Fed does need to calm the markets. After the credit crisis, it did just that. But when the economy and market are strong, as they were during the dot-com and housing bubbles, what, pray tell, is the point of calming the markets? Of raising rates in a predictable fashion? If you think the markets are complacent, then unnerve them. Over the past 20 years the Fed may have perfected the art of reassuring the markets, but it has lost the power to scare. And that means stock markets more easily overshoot, and then collapse.The Fed could dampen this cycle. It has, in interest rate policy, not one tool but two: the level of rates and the uncertainty of rates. Given the sensitivity of risk preferences to uncertainty, the Fed could use policy uncertainty and a higher volatility of funds to selectively target risk taking in the financial community. People running factories or coffee shops or drilling wells might not even notice. And that means the Fed could keep the level of rates lower than otherwise to stimulate the economy.IT may seem counterintuitive to use uncertainty to quell volatility. But a small amount of uncertainty surrounding short-term interest rates may act much like a vaccine immunizing the stock market against bubbles. More generally, if we view humans as embodied brains instead of disembodied minds, we can see that the risk-taking pathologies found in traders also lead chief executives, trial lawyers, oil executives and others to swing from excessive and ill-conceived risks to petrified risk aversion. It will also teach us to manage these risk takers, much as sport physiologists manage athletes, to stabilize their risk taking and to lower stress.And that possibility opens up exciting vistas of human performance.Advertisement"}

A prerecession boom in that sector created 1.6 million jobs for Latino immigrants from 2004 to 2007. Researchers do not expect many of those jobs to return.\u201cIf job opportunities and wage growth remain anemic in the United States, it is likely that immigration inflows are not likely to return to prerecession levels either,\u201d Mr. Kochhar said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see signs on the horizon that this is going to change anytime soon.\u201d\u201cThere are some people coming, but there are an equal number going back,\u201d Mr. Kochhar said of Mexican immigrants. \u201cThe inflow has been canceled by the outflow.\u201dAccording to the report, American-born Latinos are benefiting most from the job recovery in part because their numbers have increased. Since the recovery began in 2009, Latinos born in the United States gained 2.3 million jobs, more than making up for the 37,000 jobs lost during the recession. Latino immigrants lost 340,000 jobs during the recession and have gained 453,000 jobs since the recovery began. The unemployment rate among Latinos age 16 and older was 8.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, the study said.The study said that job growth among Latinos since the recession ended has been concentrated in the service industries \u2014 restaurants, lodging, wholesale and retail trades as well as professional and business services, which includes consulting and landscaping.Wages among foreign-born Latinos and those born in the United States have also remained relatively stagnant since 2007, with median weekly earnings for American-born Latinos at $640 compared with $500 for those born abroad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saying No to Austerity, Spain Unveils Tax Cuts", "Date": "2014-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Turning its back on fiscal austerity, the Spanish government presented a broad package of income and corporate tax cuts on Friday that are scheduled to begin before next year\u2019s general election.The cuts roll back some of the tax increases that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy began putting into effect shortly after his conservative Popular Party swept to power in 2011 by winning a parliamentary majority. The next election is scheduled to take place by November 2015.Under the plan introduced on Friday, which covers 2015 and 2016, taxpayers would pay an average of 12.5 percent less in income tax by the end of that period. Over the two years, corporate taxes would be reduced about five percentage points.Crist\u00f3bal Montoro, Spain\u2019s budget minister, told reporters on Friday, \u201cThe time has come to lower taxes for everybody.\u201dThe plan is likely to come under close scrutiny from the European Commission, reflecting concern that reducing taxes could jeopardize Madrid\u2019s pledge to cut its deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2016 from an expected 5.6 percent in 2014.On Friday, the government also rejected raising Spain\u2019s value-added tax despite suggestions from Brussels that Spain should consider increasing consumption levies and other indirect taxes to help meet deficit goals.Instead, Mr. Montoro forecast that cutting taxes would increase both investment and consumption, helping to increase Spain\u2019s gross domestic product and keeping the country on track to meeting its deficit targets.The package of tax cuts had been expected since Mr. Rajoy described some minor fiscal concessions during his state of the nation address to Parliament in February, when he promised citizens to \u201csoften demands now that the sacrifices that Spanish society has made are yielding fruit.\u201dThe tax plan underlines the extent to which Spain\u2019s economic situation has improved significantly from two years ago, when Mr. Rajoy was struggling to contain a recession and banking crisis that led his government to negotiate a European bailout to keep afloat Bankia and other banks being crippled by mortgage loan defaults.Spain ended up needing only about 40 percent of its potential bailout of 100 billion euros, or $136 billion, and the country emerged from recession in late 2013. Spain\u2019s borrowing costs have plunged recently as investors have shifted money out of emerging markets and into countries on the periphery of the euro zone, reflecting confidence that the European Central Bank can contain the debt crisis.Madrid is also struggling with a secessionist drive in Catalonia, whose regional government plans to hold an independence referendum in November, which Mr. Rajoy has promised to prevent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Job Seeker\u2019s Desperate Choice", "Date": "2014-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the morning of March 20, Shanesha Taylor had a job interview. It was for a good job, one that could support her three children, unlike the many positions she\u2019d applied for that paid only $10 an hour. The interview, at an insurance agency in Scottsdale, Ariz., went well. \u201cWalking out of the office, you know that little skip thing people do?\u201d she said, clicking her heels together in a corny expression of glee. \u201cI wanted to do that.\u201dThe article ricocheted across the Internet. Many viewed her story \u2014 that she, unable to find child care, had left her two sons, aged 6 months and 2 years, in her 2006 Dodge Durango while she went to a 70-minute job interview \u2014 as emblematic of the harsh realities of today\u2019s economy, where jobs are scarce and well-paid ones even scarcer, and where desperate choices have become common. Certainly, many people could identify with the cruel math of Ms. Taylor\u2019s pretrial report, which put her monthly income at $1,232 (including food stamps), while her monthly expenses totaled $1,274.All at once, Ms. Taylor had become a symbol of both economic desperation and shirked responsibility. Her story became fodder for polemic and preaching. But until a recent interview with The New York Times in a conference room at the office of her lawyer, Benjamin P. Taylor II (no relation), she had not spoken publicly.Wearing jeans and a T-shirt, and with Antoine Duncan, 33, the father of her children, at her side, Ms. Taylor described how her life had slowly disintegrated during the recession, with low-paid jobs and irregular hours. In an attempt to improve her lot, she enrolled in a community college. When she spoke about her children, she teared up easily, bringing to mind her now-famous mug shot. But she had a tendency to gloss over the details of her financial troubles unless pressed.Even though her financial experiences hew closely to those of millions of Americans in the recession and its aftermath, she did not ascribe her troubles to broader economic forces. \u201cI understand the economy is suffering,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in the grand scheme I can\u2019t explain to my daughter that \u2018The economy\u2019s bad, baby; that\u2019s why we don\u2019t have a home.\u2019 She\u2019s going to look at me and say, \u2018O.K., why don\u2019t you have a job?' \u201dFrom House to HouseMs. Taylor grew up in a household she described as \u201ca little less than middle class.\u201d Her mother and stepfather often worked more than one job each. \u201cI don\u2019t even know when they saw each other,\u201d she said. She liked school but thought that college was financially out of reach, so after high school she joined the Air Force, stationed in Texas, North Dakota and Britain before returning home in 1999.At the time, Phoenix was booming and the housing market was growing manic. Ms. Taylor soon found her niche as a mortgage loan officer, bringing home commissions large enough to rent a house and live comfortably. She reconnected with Mr. Duncan, whom she had met while in the Air Force, and in 2004, their daughter was born.The overheated mortgage market in Phoenix was banking on the continued rise of home values. But after mid-2006, those values began to decline, making refinancing impossible for Ms. Taylor\u2019s increasingly desperate clients.In 2008, after the death of her grandmother, with whom she was close, Ms. Taylor quit her job, she said, to give herself time to regroup. But she never regained her economic footing. She spent down her savings, only to find that the customer-service and phone-sales jobs for which she qualified were paying less than before and were harder to come by. \u201cI had to downgrade to an apartment; it got difficult paying day care, apartment, car payments, insurance \u2014 all the basic needs in life,\u201d she said.In late 2011, Ms. Taylor and Mr. Duncan had a son and were living together as a family. But they couldn\u2019t afford rent and so they moved to a \u201cweekly,\u201d a cheap motel that is often the last stop before homelessness. Ms. Taylor was working in customer service, making $12.35 an hour. To keep her student loan debt \u2014 now about $30,000, she said \u2014 from ballooning, Ms. Taylor tried to pay for her own classes, but eventually took a break from school in mid-2012.When money became even tighter, she and the children stayed with her parents. In 2013, her work hours were cut and she lost a child-care subsidy she\u2019d been getting. She became pregnant with her younger son, was placed on bed rest, and during her absence she was fired, she said. By the time she was arrested, she said, she was filling in as an office aide at a home health care agency for about eight hours every other week. She was paid $8 an hour in cash, she said. (The agency said Ms. Taylor had not worked there \u2014 she had been offered a job, the human resources manager said, but she had not taken it because she could not find child care.)Living with her parents in Phoenix was not a permanent solution. When other serious family matters began to put a strain on them, Ms. Taylor said, she and the children decamped, going from house to house when friends or relatives could provide shelter. On a couple of occasions, she said, she and the children slept in the Durango for days at a time.Mr. Duncan was having his own troubles making ends meet, working sometimes as a day laborer and other times at call centers, and living in a small apartment with roommates. He now makes $10 an hour doing customer service for a cable company.\u201cWe don\u2019t communicate well sometimes, and that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d Ms. Taylor said in the interview. \u201cFinances had a lot to do with it. You know, not being able to make ends meet sometimes strains a relationship.\u201d\u2018What Do I Do Now?\u2019More often than not, Ms. Taylor said, she was solely responsible for meeting her family\u2019s needs. Her Facebook page, which she hasn\u2019t updated since her arrest, is littered with encomiums about motherhood (sample: \u201cYour children will become who you are, so be who you want them to be\u201d), photographs of her children (caption: \u201clove my babies to the maxxxx\u201d) and a recounting of her daughter\u2019s fretting about Santa\u2019s health (she wanted to leave him broccoli instead of cookies).Ms. Taylor strove not to let her children feel the bite of poverty. \u201cI would say, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re not going to go to Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s today; we\u2019re going to go to the park,' \u201d she said.Looking for stability, she applied for job after job \u2014 PetSmart for $10 an hour, a bus company for $10 an hour, an Internet service provider. But the job at a Farmers Insurance broker in Scottsdale was different. \u201cThirty-nine thousand the first year, $65,000 the second year, $89,000 the third year,\u201d Ms. Taylor recited. \u201cAnd the fourth year, with proper work, I could have had my own agency.\u201d She thought her experience as a loan officer made her a perfect candidate. She had a feeling that the job would be hers.The night before the interview, she put the children to bed at her parents\u2019 house and went to a Walmart parking lot, where she spent hours scrounging up recyclable cans and asking passers-by for gas money, to make sure she had enough for the 35-mile drive to the interview. Her parents would be at work the next day, so she had arranged to leave the boys at a babysitter\u2019s house, she said. But when she arrived, she said, no one answered the door.\u201cI felt like this was my opportunity to basically improve life for all of us, and the one key part of it is now not available, so what do I do now?\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cThat was my only thought: \u2018What do I do now? What do I do now?\u2019 That was kind of what started the whole chain of events that day.\u201dShe drove to Scottsdale, to an anonymous cluster of office buildings, and parked the car in the lot. There was no shade. It was 71 degrees. According to the police report, she left the boys strapped into their car seats, the tinted windows cracked, and the keys in the ignition with the fan blowing but the engine off.About a half-hour later, two women heading to lunch walked past the car, heard crying and called 911. The boys were sweating and, according to a paramedic who responded, they \u201cshowed signs of heat distress,\u201d the police report said, but were ultimately found to be unharmed.The children had already been taken to a hospital when an officer saw a woman \u201crunning toward us with a panicked look on her face,\u201d the report said. \u201cShe repeated to me how much she needed this job and that she had no other option but to leave her kids in the car so that she could attend the interview.\u201dA man at the Farmers Insurance office where Ms. Taylor had been interviewed said the office had no comment. Ms. Taylor said she had been offered the job. The police report does not mention the missing babysitter, saying only that Ms. Taylor told the authorities that she had been unable to find child care and had timed the interview to coincide with the children\u2019s nap. On the advice of her lawyer, Ms. Taylor would not speak about her mind-set when she decided to leave the boys in the car.But leaving a child in a car in Arizona can be extremely dangerous. The police estimated that the temperature in the Durango when they found the children was more than 100 degrees. Mr. Montgomery\u2019s office is handling three other cases \u2014 two fatal \u2014 in which children were left in cars, and he clearly wants to send a message to parents.\u201cI respect the fact that people want to be heard on what they think should occur in this case,\u201d Mr. Montgomery said at a news conference in April. \u201cBut I\u2019ll point out that not a single communication that\u2019s come into this office as of yet has mentioned at all the position that those two young children were put in. Everything has focused on the mother.\u201dMs. Taylor\u2019s lawyer has said that his client is not a criminal, but the victim of an economic system. \u201cShe was arrested for trying to get a job,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t going to a liquor store. She wasn\u2019t going to a party. She was going to a job interview.\u201dMr. Montgomery, the prosecutor, has resisted this narrative of economic privation. Because Ms. Taylor listed an address \u2014 her parents\u2019 \u2014 on her court papers, the prosecutor says she was not homeless. And because she listed a part-time job \u2014 the very part-time office aide job \u2014 she was not unemployed.Ms. Taylor has no prior felonies. Reports that her younger son had tested positive for drugs when he was born were incorrect, according to a spokeswoman for Arizona Child Protective Services, which is not permitted to volunteer information but only to confirm or clarify information given by others. The spokeswoman said Ms. Taylor\u2019s doctor had reported that she tested positive for an illegal drug while she was pregnant, and she confirmed Ms. Taylor\u2019s account that the drug was marijuana. Ms. Taylor said the test was taken on the day she learned that she was two months pregnant. The spokeswoman could not confirm the date of the test.Now Ms. Taylor acknowledges that leaving the children in the car was a mistake, one that was particularly difficult to speak about with her daughter, whom she has always warned to avoid jail at all costs. \u201cI had to explain to her, well, I did something wrong, that\u2019s why I had to go,\u201d she said.\u2018I Stay Inside and I Cry\u2019On March 30, Ms. Taylor walked out of jail as a controversial figure, provoking sympathy and condemnation by turns. With a possible felony conviction overshadowing her, her job prospects were even slimmer than before. Far worse, in her mind, she was not allowed to see her children, who were being cared for by a relative.During the day, when they were not home, she would drop off clothes and diapers for them. Some evenings, she spoke to them by telephone. Anticipating that she would be required to take parenting classes, she put in a request to begin them at once. A few days after her interview with The Times, a judge gave her permission to visit the children for the first time in more than two months.For the first time in years, on the other hand, Ms. Taylor had no financial worries. More than $100,000 had been contributed to her cause.\u201cPeople ask me all the time, \u2018Are you happier now?\u2019 They feel that I should be over the moon,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen, truth be told, I stay inside and I cry because I don\u2019t have my children.\u201d The money will be used to create a stable home and benefit the children, said Ms. Taylor and her lawyer, who is working pro bono. The next hearing is in July.In the meantime, the ordeal has persuaded Ms. Taylor and Mr. Duncan to make another go of things, and they said they have been seeing a couples counselor.\u201cThis is one of those eye-opening situations that makes you feel like that there are some things that are bigger than yourself, so sometimes you have to learn to communicate in order to make life better,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cBecause, I mean, I understand that a two-parent household is better than a one-parent household, and they love their dad to death; it\u2019s \u2018Daddy\u2019 all day. So it\u2019s letting go of your own notions of how things are supposed to go.\u201dMs. Taylor has also rented and furnished a modest three-bedroom house. It\u2019s easy to see where most of her energy has gone: Her daughter\u2019s room is decorated in many shades of pink, with flower-shaped pillows on the bed and a pink desk set. For the boys, there is a Disney theme and a rug printed with a roadway for toy cars. In the closet waits a row of little outfits on child-size hangers.Ms. Taylor is waiting, too, not just for her children to come home, but for her life to restart. She is particularly impatient to start college again.\u201cTen dollars an hour is basically going to keep me broke, keep me dependent on food stamps and Medicare and things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live like that forever. I want to get out and do something bigger and better and be self-sustaining.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republican Case Against Republican Economics", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the 2012 presidential election, key Republicans began to criticize their party\u2019s opposition to immigration reform and gay rights. But now party reformers are questioning something much more central: free-market orthodoxy.\u201cThis tired GOP sequel stumbles in its macroeconomic analysis,\u201d Pethokoukis writes, noting that the manifesto contains \u201cno suggestion the economy faces longer-term problems that predate Obamanomics.\u201d Pethokoukis argues that the manifesto\u2019s anti-tax rhetoric fails to grasp that \u201ccoping with America\u2019s rising elderly population will require a higher national tax burden in coming decades even with a reformed entitlement system.\u201d The conservative call for a balanced budget ignores the fact that \u201cthere is no evidence that markets fear a U.S. debt crisis.\u201dGerson and Wehner criticize the domination of Republican economic policy by \u201crhetorical zeal and indiscipline in which virtually every reference to government is negative, disparaging, and denigrating. It is justified by an apocalyptic narrative of American life: We are fast approaching a point of no return at which we stand to lose our basic liberties and our national character.\u201dThe two writers develop an argument rare in Republican circles. They cite the liabilities of an economic worldview that doesn\u2019t recognize the need for government \u201cto help those who cannot individually do for themselves, to advance justice in an unjust world, and to lift up the weakest members of society.\u201d They go on to make the case that \u201cmany conservatives fail to see the extent to which equal opportunity itself, a central principle of our national self-understanding, is becoming harder to achieve. It is a well-documented fact that, in recent years, economic mobility has stalled for many poorer Americans, resulting in persistent intergenerational inequality.\u201dConservative reformers have sparked interest on the left, but some liberal commentators remain distrustful of the willingness of intraparty insurgents to seriously challenge Tea Party commitments.Both Chait and Dionne may be underestimating the significance of dissent among conservative policy wonks.In other words, the conservative coalition, already facing demographic challenges from the rise of minority voters, is likely to lose core white support if it maintains its dominant anti-government ideology.Once fissures have appeared in the conservative belief system, it will become increasingly difficult to maintain hegemony \u2013 or, to mix metaphors, you cannot unscramble a scrambled egg.Conservatism, as currently construed, faces the risk of irrelevance if it fails to address the consequences of globalization and automation, two of the most powerful forces driving the hollowing-out of the middle-class job market.Pethokoukis points out that the Cruz-Lee-Meese manifesto fails to acknowledge that \u201cglobalization and automation are playing a role. Going forward, some economists fear a permanently bifurcated labor force with rising pay for a slice of tech-savvy workers, and stagnant wages for everyone else. It\u2019s not all about Obama\u2019s economy.\u201dIn fact, few developments could prove more beneficial to the public at large than for the left and right to compete over proposed strategies to deal with globalization and automation. Liberals so far have been stymied while conservatives have neglected these issues.This is a sharp decline from March 2010, when 48 percent agreed and 3 percent disagreed, but still a substantial roadblock for those seeking to shift the direction of the party.These hurdles leave reformers in a difficult position: To prove their case, they need their party to fail. A Democratic victory in 2016 would open the door for Republican insurgents and provide the kind of credibility essential in politics. But conservative mutineers cannot afford to be seen or heard rooting for defeat, even if that\u2019s where their hearts lie.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Remember the Problems With Mortgage Defaults? They\u2019re Coming Back With Student Loans", "Date": "2014-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerverse IncentivesStudent loans, along with mortgages and car loans, have become one of the three largest sources of credit, exceeding credit-card debt. This growth in student debt appears to have caught regulators unprepared. Compared with mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, student loans are loosely regulated, and that regulatory weakness is particularly threatening to consumers because they can\u2019t discharge their debts through bankruptcy and escape lenders who are causing them harm.Borrowers \u2014 and the economy at large \u2014 are suffering as a result. Every borrower in default has a damaged credit record, which increases the cost of buying a home or car and can result in lost job opportunities. Many landlords won\u2019t rent to someone with a bad credit record.The parallels with the mortgage crisis are striking. In both cases, the companies managing the loans have been slow to devise loan forgiveness plans for borrowers who run into trouble, hurting both the borrowers and the broader economy. In both cases, it often isn\u2019t clear who even owns the underlying loans, further slowing efforts to restructure them.This is unsurprising. Student loan servicers have little incentive to prevent borrowers from defaulting, because the servicers either don\u2019t own the underlying loans or, if they do, face few costs if a borrower defaults. Restructuring a borrower\u2019s payments and preventing default requires effort, and the beneficiary of this effort is the government and the student \u2014 not the servicer.The problem is particularly obvious in the Direct Loan program, in which the federal government owns the student loans and pays servicers a fee to interact with borrowers. Here we have a classic \u201cprincipal-agent\u201d problem, with the agent (the servicers) having little incentive to act in the best interests of the principal (the federal government). Carefully written contracts are required to make such relationships work well; an entire field of economics, mechanism design, is devoted to studying these contracts. If the principal can\u2019t get the incentives right, in some cases she should just do the job herself. In this case, that would mean the federal government collecting payments on the loans it makes. Taxpayers would most likely come out better in that situation.Consumer protection is particularly important in the context of student loans, because borrowers have few ways to escape an unhelpful servicer. Borrowers don\u2019t choose their servicers; they are assigned by the owner of the loan, whether that\u2019s the federal government or a private bank.Even bankruptcy doesn\u2019t sever the tie between a borrower and a lender, since student loans survive bankruptcy. Legally, federal student loans have long been presumed to do so. Since 2005, even private loans (which, unlike federal loans, typically require a co-signer) are presumed to survive bankruptcy. Student lenders and servicers therefore have a captive customer.Most students can repay their loans without running into major problems. But the number who do struggle is significant, and the struggles can come to dominate their financial lives. As with mortgages, credit cards and auto loans, students loans keep our economy ticking. They make it possible for millions of students to invest in education. But when they don\u2019t work well, they create major problems for borrowers and for the economy at large.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Banks Balk at Cheap Loans, Worried About Strings Attached", "Date": "2014-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 It sounds like an offer too good to refuse: nearly unlimited loans at an annual interest rate of only 0.25 percent.Borrow $1 million for four years, and the interest per year would be barely a rounding error: $2,500.That is effectively the offer the European Central Bank, as part of its ambitious new effort to revive the euro zone\u2019s economies, has just made to commercial banks. Yet it is by no means certain that banks will want that cheap money, and that could defeat the purpose of the program.The central bank, which considers tight credit one of the euro zone\u2019s biggest problems, wants banks to funnel loans to hard-pressed countries like Italy and Portugal. But if the banks say no and lending remains stuck at its current low levels, the euro zone recovery could continue to only limp along.Why would banks refuse to take money that would come at practically no cost? Because low-cost is not the same as risk-free.The central bank is requiring that the money be lent to businesses and other private customers. But lending to companies, many of which might not be able to repay the loans, is how many of the euro zone\u2019s problem banks got into trouble during the financial crisis. Banks in countries like Italy are still trying to work through staggering amounts of bad loans.\u201cThis financial fragility of nonfinancial firms is an issue,\u201d said Giovanni Sabatini, director general of the Italian Bankers Association. \u201cThe demand for credit is not good-quality demand.\u201dThe fragility of the euro zone recovery has been underscored by new data this week. On Tuesday, a closely watched barometer of business confidence in Germany slipped because managers were worried about turmoil in Ukraine and Iraq. The day before, a separate survey of purchasing managers by Markit Economics indicated that euro zone growth had been slowing.The central bank has forecast that it will lend 400 billion euros, or nearly $544 billion, through the so-called targeted loan program. But even Mario Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, made no promises that this lending would be a magic elixir for the economy.The loans will not be available until September and could take as long as a year to translate to economic growth, Mr. Draghi has said.It is hardly the first time that the European Central Bank has flooded banks with cheap cash. But the terms of this round of funding are the most generous yet. Banks will be able to take out almost unlimited four-year loans, compared with a previous maximum of three years.And the interest rate will be fixed over the life of the loan at the benchmark interest rate plus a fee of 0.10 percentage point. At the current official rate, that adds up to 0.25 percent. The loans would be even cheaper if the central bank cut its benchmark rate again.But Mr. Draghi has learned from experience that if he wants a voice in how the money is used, he must attach strings. In contrast to past programs, banks this time cannot use the cheap cash to buy government bonds paying, for instance, 5 percent interest, and pocket the difference. Banks have to lend the money to businesses, which will require doing the hard work of assessing which ones are creditworthy.And in the countries that need the money most, separating the good borrowers from the bad is particularly tricky. The five countries hit hardest by the euro zone debt crisis \u2014 Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland \u2014 have all suffered steep increases in loans in or near default.In Greece, loans classified as nonperforming, or unlikely to be repaid, had soared to 31 percent of all loans at the end of last year, from 7 percent in 2009. In Italy, nonperforming loans rose to 15 percent of the total at the end of last year, from 9 percent in 2009, according to World Bank data.And the number has continued to rise at many banks. At Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the world\u2019s oldest bank, nonperforming loans totaled 17 percent of all loans at the end of March, an increase of 17 percent from a year earlier.The surge in problem loans is part of a vicious circle. In southern Europe, recession caused many people to lose their jobs, which meant they had trouble repaying their loans. As the jobless \u2014 or people worried about losing their jobs \u2014 spent less money, the businesses they patronized lost sales. Many of these business then had trouble repaying their loans.To cover growing losses, banks raised interest rates on new loans. Credit became even more expensive, acting as a further drag on the economy and creating a deeper recession.The European Central Bank hopes to break this so-called doom loop by making the cheap money available and requiring banks to use it for lending, especially to small businesses. In doing so, the central bank is copying a similar program used by the Bank of England. But unlike its British counterpart, the E.C.B. is not allowing banks to use the money for mortgages, to avoid creating a real estate bubble in countries like Germany.Even if commercial banks do take the money, enforcing the restrictions could be tricky. And the punishment would not be severe. Banks that failed to meet benchmarks for new lending, which will vary from bank to bank, would have to repay the money after two years instead of four. The central bank is still working out details of the lending program, but so far has not suggested there would be any other financial penalties.Some bankers question whether businesses in troubled countries are even interested in taking out loans to finance expansion \u2014 the kind of borrowing that creates jobs.Mr. Sabatini of the Italian Bankers Association said that much of the demand for loans in Italy was still from businesses trying to refinance short-term debt at lower interest rates, rather than manufacturers wanting to increase production or retailers wanting to add floor space and sales staff.\u201cDemand for new investment is close to zero,\u201d Mr. Sabatini said, though he applauded the central bank\u2019s actions as a show of its willingness to do everything it could to help the euro zone economy.Martin Blessing, chief executive of Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said the problem in much of southern Europe was not really the lack of credit. The trouble, he said, is that there are still too many hurdles to entrepreneurship.\u201cHow long does it take to set up a business? How long does it take to get a telephone? What are the insolvency laws?\u201d Mr. Blessing said at a business gathering in Frankfurt this month. \u201cI\u2019m not sure more liquidity will solve the problems we have there.\u201dEven if the central bank cash is unlikely to be transformational, though, some analysts think it has a chance of helping. The money will become available shortly before the bank completes a review of bank assets to determine which lenders need greater capital buffers. If successful, the so-called asset quality review will have a cathartic effect, exposing the weak banks and removing doubts about the healthy ones.In that case, the central bank cash could arrive just when the mood is shifting and contribute to a faster turnaround, said Brian J. Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management.Mr. Jacobsen said he had even begun investing selectively in Italian banks. He is optimistic, he said, that efforts by the Italian government to improve the economy will begin to pay off and that banks have made progress cleaning up their problems.\u201cEuro zone banks could go from being a drag on growth to being a contributor,\u201d Mr. Jacobsen said. An additional \u20ac400 billion in credit, he said, \u201cis nothing to scoff at.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Interest Rate Increase Is Not Seen as Imminent", "Date": "2014-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve can reasonably wait to raise interest rates until mid-2015 without risking an undesirable rise in inflation, an influential Fed policy maker said on Tuesday.\u201cWe think we can get the unemployment rate considerably lower and still not have an inflation problem,\u201d said William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \u201cWe also don\u2019t have inflation at a level consistent with price stability.\u201dIn May, the unemployment rate stood at 6.3 percent, the lowest level since the end of 2008 and unchanged from April. Inflation has been running below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent goal, although some recent readings have been firmer.\u201cThe market expectations are that the Federal Reserve will start to raise short-term interest rates around the middle of 2015 \u2014 that sounds to me like a reasonable forecast,\u201d Mr. Dudley told a Puerto Rico accounting group. \u201cBut, you know, forecasts often go astray.\u201dMr. Dudley, who as chief of the New York Fed holds a permanent vote on the central bank\u2019s policy-making panel, speaks from experience: In the last several years the Fed has been frequently overly optimistic about economic growth prospects, and officials have had to repeatedly lower their forecasts.At the same time, the Fed has underestimated how quickly unemployment will drop; it now sees the jobless rate as approaching near normal levels this year.Mr. Dudley\u2019s comments, which often reflect dominant sentiment at the Fed, suggest the central bank is in no hurry to raise rates from their current near-zero level once it winds down its bond-buying stimulus this year.Traders of short-term interest rate futures currently peg June 2015 as the likely start of an expected gradual run of interest rate increases by the United States central bank.Speaking at a separate event, Charles I. Plosser, the hawkish president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said he had \u201cgrowing concerns that we may have to adjust our communications in the not-too-distant future. Specifically, I believe the forward guidance in the statement may be too passive.\u201dMr. Plosser\u2019s comments reflect concern among a minority at the Fed that the central bank may wait too long before raising rates, allowing inflation to spiral upward and out of control. Mr. Dudley made it clear on Tuesday that he did not share those concerns.\u201cIn the current environment, it is still very, very appropriate to continue to follow a very accommodative monetary policy because we\u2019re making progress toward our objectives but we have not yet reached our objectives,\u201d Mr. Dudley said.

Turns out, even the people whose job it is to decide aren\u2019t sure. And their reasoning shows why the economic situation seems so perilous in Europe, even though its economy isn\u2019t clearly shrinking. In fact, part of their hesitation to call the end of the recession stems from their fear that policy makers may not be sufficiently concerned about the state of the economy.In other words, if the European economy keeps growing and eventually accelerates, then it will turn out that the first quarter of 2013 was the trough of a recession that began in the third quarter of 2011. However, if there\u2019s a renewed dip, then the committee will interpret it as just one giant, prolonged recession.Recessions are unfortunate, but at least they end.

{"Headline": "Scots Are Divided Over Independence, and Its Economic Costs", "Date": "2014-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEITH, Scotland \u2014 The case for tearing apart the United Kingdom was made on a recent evening at a community center in this small town near Glasgow. More than 200 people were packed into folding chairs and standing along walls lined with posters promoting an independent Scotland, like the one with the word \u201cAye\u201d emblazoned on a Scottish flag. A disco ball hung overhead.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s deputy first minister, spoke from a lectern covered with a tartan drape.\u201cAs a country, we\u2019ve spent an awful long number of years being told we\u2019re too wee, too poor and probably a bit too stupid to be independent,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we were too small and too poor and too stupid, if we were the economic basket case, if we were the subsidy junkies that some of our opponents try to imply that we are, then don\u2019t you think Westminster might have offloaded us by now?\u201dAfter the applause died down, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the downside?\u201dPlenty, in the minds of many business leaders and economists, who are concerned that an independent Scotland will not have the financial strength to prosper alone. The economy would lean heavily on revenue from North Sea oil, which has been falling, and its per capita government spending outpaces the rest of Britain.The official campaign period kicked off Friday for the referendum that will determine whether Scotland will remain in Britain. If successful, the vote, which will be in September, would fundamentally reshape America\u2019s closest ally, redrawing the borders of a union that has existed for more than 300 years.The movement goes beyond the nationalistic pride that has fed previous calls for a split. For Scottish nationalists, much of the discontent comes down to clashing politics. They believe that the British government is far too conservative and has pushed austerity on a Scottish government that never wanted it.9 Photos\u201cWe again take a different view about the macroeconomic choices available for the country,\u201d John Swinney, Scotland\u2019s finance minister, said in challenging the British approach.Nationalists envision a fully independent Scotland as a petro-power. But oil revenue has fallen sharply, by 38 percent from 2010 to 2013. Last year, Scotland paid less into Westminster\u2019s coffers than it took out. Total revenue, including its geographic share of North Sea oil, was about $89 billion, against spending of roughly $109 billion. Another recent analysis by the University of Glasgow\u2019s Center for Public Policy for Regions projects that Scotland will be \u201csignificantly worse off than the U.K.\u201d for several years to come, with a higher deficit of almost $1,700 a person in the fiscal year ending in 2016.Then there is the debt. The cost of servicing Scotland\u2019s proportional share of Britain\u2019s debt \u201cwould be worth twice as much as North Sea oil,\u201d said John McLaren, a professor at the University of Glasgow.Scotland is threatening to walk away from any share of its debt should it be kept out of a currency union.

{"Headline": "Euro Zone Edges Closer to Dreaded Deflation", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Consumer prices in the euro zone ticked ever closer to outright deflation, official data showed Tuesday, making it almost certain that the European Central Bank will move to ease monetary policy this week.The weak price pressures were pronounced even in Germany, now the strongest economy in the euro zone. Consumer prices there rose at just a 0.9 percent rate in May, down from 1.3 percent in April, and the lowest in four years.Many economists say that inflation is already well below the danger zone for tipping into deflation, and some analysts have taken to calling the condition \u201clowflation.\u201dDeflation, spurred by falling wages and depressed consumer demand, hits borrowers by raising the real value of loans, and has the potential to weaken Europe\u2019s fragile financial sector.The Governing Council of the European Central Bank, which meets Thursday, targets an inflation rate of just below 2 percent, a level that it has been undershooting for months.Gilles Mo\u00ebc, the chief Europe economist for Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note before the reports on Tuesday that the central bank would very likely move on Thursday to ease monetary policy further, perhaps by cutting its main interest rates and extending more long-term loans to financial institutions. It may even institute a negative deposit rate \u2014 a tax, in effect, on lenders\u2019 holdings kept at the central bank \u2014 to encourage more lending.But he said that investors might be surprised to find that the scale of the central bank\u2019s actions would probably be significantly smaller than those taken by other central banks, including the Federal Reserve in the United States.Financial markets reacted calmly to the reports. The euro was almost unchanged at $1.3604, while the Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue chips slipped about 0.1 percent.\u201cEverything that could possibly be done by the E.C.B. is already priced into the market,\u201d said \u200bDerek Halpenny, the Europe head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see the euro falling much further.\u201dSix years after the excesses of the American subprime lending boom sent the global financial system into a tailspin, the European economy is barely growing and the labor market remains in a deep funk.Eurostat estimates that 25.4 million people in the European Union are without work, out of a potential labor force of more than 243 million.While the small improvement in the unemployment rate offered a glimmer of hope for the job market, the size of the improvement \u2014 the number of unemployed fell by just 151,000 across the European Union \u2014 is probably too small to affect the central bank\u2019s thinking for now.Once again, Austria, at 4.9 percent, and Germany, at 5.2 percent, had the lowest jobless rates in the euro zone, thanks in part to work-share programs that keep people employed, but in jobs that are less than full-time.The rates in Greece and Spain, at more than 25 percent, remain consistent with levels seen in economic depressions.The job market has been hammered by the euro zone debt crisis, which ushered in an era of fiscal austerity and, some economists argue, an insufficiently loose monetary policy by the European Central Bank.The inflation rate in the euro zone has been consistently falling from a recent peak of just over 3 percent in 2011.The preliminary rate in the zone for May was even lower than the 0.6 percent consensus of predictions from a Bloomberg survey of economists.The so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the more volatile food and energy prices, came in at 0.7 percent, below the consensus for an 0.8 percent rate, and down from 1 percent in April.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ethiopia\u2019s Condom Dilemma", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia \u2014 I was confused the first time I saw a giant billboard in Addis Ababa advertising Members Only and stressing how \u201cmembership has its pleasures,\u201d accompanied by a stark silhouette of a leggy female figure. It reminded me of advertisements in New York for so-called gentlemen\u2019s clubs \u2014 not the sort of places you tend to find in Ethiopia\u2019s capital, where levels of disposable income and where that money goes differ markedly.Although gross domestic product growth has averaged 10 percent a year since 2007, World Bank data from 2011 indicated that nearly 30 percent of Ethiopians still lived in poverty, subsisting on less than $2 a day. Rapid economic growth and grinding poverty exist side by side in Ethiopia, complicating the issue of how best to supply condoms.DKT is counting on that growing economy as it experiments with a move from a largely subsidized model to a commercially self-sustainable one. It has chosen not to subsidize the Members Only brand in an attempt to get a clear picture of what consumers might be willing to pay for condoms.This effort, however, is being undercut by the relentless supply of free condoms pouring into the country through organizations like U.S.A.I.D. The result is three condom types in Ethiopia: relatively expensive, full market-rate condoms; subsidized condoms (like most of those that DKT supplies); and free condoms.So which is the better approach: to price condoms just like any other product, or to treat them as potential lifesavers that should be available to anyone, anywhere, free at any time? It\u2019s a quandary for donors and agencies like DKT, which currently has about 40 million condoms stacked in its main Addis Ababa warehouse. \u201cEthiopia is still very popular with donors, and there is still a lot of aid money flowing in,\u201d said Andrew Piller, the manager of DKT\u2019s condom distribution network in Ethiopia. Sometimes, donors struggle with how to spend their funds \u2014 and giveaway contraceptives are easy to provide and seem like a good idea. But as a result of free condoms, DKT has seen its market share slide from about 70 percent in 2009 to 30 percent today, making the goal of achieving a sustainable business, and a sustainable condom supply for Ethiopia, that much harder.\u201cWe support market segmentation, but there is a limit to what we can expect people to pay for, given the financial situation,\u201d said Keith Hummel, a commodities and logistics adviser for U.S.A.I.D. in Ethiopia. According to the agency, targeted distribution of free condoms combined with health promotions can actually create demand for the purchase of condoms.Ethiopia\u2019s condom situation seems emblematic of the wider policy debate about aid in Ethiopia and Africa: the merits \u2014 or otherwise \u2014 of a giveaway-aid culture as opposed to capacity building. Decades of foreign aid, which still flows in, have undoubtedly played a part in shaping a mind-set of soliciting money from strangers, as numerous Ethiopians have told me. Foreigners and their organizations continue to be perceived as having access to unlimited wealth (somewhat understandable), which they are obliged to provide on request (less understandable or justifiable).Giving away free condoms arguably contributes to this trend, especially if there is no end in sight \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear if or when the influx of free condoms might stop. Since Ethiopia has avoided the alarming rates of H.I.V. infection seen in much of southern and eastern Africa, the efficacy of the two types of condom-distribution systems running in parallel appears vindicated.This is recognized by those like Mr. Piller who don\u2019t want to move immediately to a full free-market system and see the supply of free condoms ended; they argue instead for better coordination among the differing supply systems and the organizations involved. So, by all means, keep supplying free condoms to those Ethiopians who live on less than $2 a day, but why not let the Ethiopian government shoulder the financial burden?With one of the fastest growing economies in Africa, Ethiopia should be able to find the funds to take over administering the free condom-distribution networks and programs already in place. And if the government builds on the groundwork already laid by agencies like U.S.A.I.D., it should have little difficulty targeting the people who really need free condoms.Free condoms distributed mainly for family planning purposes are already channeled through the public health system, via government health centers and health workers in more remote areas. Free condoms targeting H.I.V. prevention also reach those in need through various organizations that work with the government\u2019s H.I.V./AIDS Prevention and Control Office, and by direct outreach to sex workers.For the government to assume full financial responsibility for the condom programs doesn\u2019t mean that foreign money should disappear overnight. Far from it: The West should remain financially involved in Ethiopia and East Africa, for the good of all parties. But this should be done by stimulating trade, entrepreneurship and joint ventures. The longer the West gives things away free, condoms included, the harder that will be to achieve. James Jeffrey is a British journalist based in Ethiopia. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Debt Vultures' Fell Swoop", "Date": "2014-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Last week, the United States Supreme Court decided not to review a ruling in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals whose effect is that Argentina must pay \u201choldout\u201d creditors who refused to participate in debt restructuring agreements that Argentina reached with the majority of bondholders following the 2001 default on its sovereign debt. Argentina\u2019s lawyers warned that the court\u2019s decision created \u201ca serious and imminent risk\u201d that the country would again be forced to default. But the ruling also has profound and disturbing implications for the functioning of the international financial system, and even the United States would most likely be adversely affected.The appellate court ruled that if Argentina was paying the holders of restructured bonds, it must also pay the holdout or vulture fund creditors in full \u2014 and its decision implies that the punishment for an attempted default could be never-ending. This raises the question of how many decades a people should be forced to suffer for the mistakes or transgressions of earlier leaders \u2014 whether elected or, as is often the case, unelected. (Much of the Argentine debt, in fact, was incurred by a dictatorship.)Another key implication of the ruling is that governments that are bankrupt would now find it difficult or impossible to negotiate a settlement with their creditors. Who will take a haircut on their bonds if they can refuse the terms and sue for the full value?In the United States, and most other countries, there are bankruptcy laws designed to allow for companies and individuals facing unpayable debt to make a new start. There is no such legal mechanism for countries, so these restructuring agreements are an important way of resolving problems of unpayable sovereign debt.The court\u2019s decision would make it difficult to issue the new bonds needed for restructuring, as well as further debt in the future. Just one holdout bondholder or vulture fund creditor could torpedo the process.Argentina may find a way around the court\u2019s decision, by issuing new bonds and making payments that are outside of the court\u2019s jurisdiction. But this ruling in favor of the vulture funds will do continuing damage to ordinary people around the world that will show up in future debt crises.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pros and Cons of Sharing", "Date": "2014-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From AmericaThere\u2019s more to being a chauffeur for the popular ride-sharing service Lyft than fastening a pink mustache to the front grill of your car.Drivers are told that they\u2019re not employees, that they\u2019re ineligible for worker benefits and that they merely belong to a \u201cpeer-to-peer transportation platform,\u201d not a taxi or limousine company. But it\u2019s the new kind of wink-wink peer-to-peer platform where you\u2019re basically a nonemployee-employee, and you had better follow the company rules.Lyft\u2019s online guidelines instruct drivers to develop their cars as \u201cinherently social spaces, with great conversation guaranteed.\u201d Cars should be vacuumed weekly. Music should be playing when passengers enter. Drivers can swap phone numbers with passengers, but can\u2019t initiate: \u201cWe\u2019re a rideshare community, not a dating service.\u201dLyft, like many attention-grabbing firms today, is a company somewhat in denial about being, well, a company. It calls itself a community, a platform. It is one of a raft of businesses that cast themselves as glorified phone directories, simply helping people to locate and contract with one another to drive (Uber), do odd jobs (TaskRabbit) or rent space (Airbnb).To some, the phonebook posture is spin, pure and simple, and unconvincing spin at that. After all, the companies are happy to behave like old-fashioned companies when it comes to raising coffers of money, massaging brands and lobbying governments about policy.But at a moment when libertarian ideas are ascendant in Washington and Silicon Valley, firms like Lyft and Airbnb take on added significance. Love these services or loathe them, use them or don\u2019t, they are raising interesting questions about the ballet of markets and the state. Consider three.The first, raised by Airbnb in a recent ad campaign featuring down-on-their-luck homeowners who support themselves by renting out space in their homes, concerns the less fortunate. Companies like Airbnb are forcing us to ask whether the little guy actually needs more access to the market as producers and sellers of services rather than more protection from it as consumers. What is the tradeoff between encouraging someone with a car to make some money shuttling others to where they need to go and allowing him to carry passengers without enough insurance to provide full coverage in case of an accident?Another question is whether consumers should be free to choose less-regulated options that bypass traditional distribution channels. Should consumers be allowed to buy unpasteurized milk, knowing the risks? Should they be able to buy Tesla\u2019s electric cars directly, without the middleman (and perhaps protection) of dealers? Should they be able to import medicine from abroad via the Internet, even if those drugs haven\u2019t been approved for Americans?What the new sharing-economy companies argue, self-interestedly, is that internal mechanisms can achieve the same quality control as governmental regulation. \u201cWhat makes these platforms work is the feedback loop between providers, hosts, and the platform in the form of reviews, identity verification, and social proof,\u201d Leigh Drogen, the founder of a company called Estimize, wrote in a much-discussed LinkedIn blog post this month.Third, these sharing services make us ask: What is the threshold for something to be considered a business in this digitized new economy? If I introduce you to my friend Bob, and Bob is willing to drive you to the airport, and you pay Bob $20 for his trouble, no one is going to call that a business and demand to regulate it. If I do that weekly, does that make it a business? Daily? Where does the unregulated informal economy that every society possesses end and formal commerce begin?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keeping Britain in the E.U.", "Date": "2014-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyIt is not just Britain that would be hurt if it quit the European Union. So would the rest of the bloc. Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s nomination on Friday as president of the European Commission, the Union\u2019s executive branch, increases the chance of Brexit \u2014 Britain\u2019s exit from the group. Leaders from all countries now need to work to cut the risk.David Cameron, the British prime minister, went out on a limb to block Mr. Juncker and failed. Mr. Cameron badly mishandled the diplomacy, including allowing it to seem that he was threatening to pull out of the Union if Mr. Juncker, a former Luxembourg prime minister, got the job. The chances of Britain quitting the Union in the next five years are probably about 20 percent. That is made up of, say, a 50 percent chance of Mr. Cameron winning the general election next year and a 40 percent chance of the British people voting to quit in a referendum he has promised to hold by 2017.The opposition Labour Party won\u2019t hold a plebiscite if it wins the general election. But that doesn\u2019t mean the question will go away, as Conservative euro-skeptics and the U.K. Independence Party will not give up \u2014 meaning there could be a referendum after 2020.Some continental Europeans may say \u201cgood riddance\u201d if Britain quits the bloc, on the grounds that it has long been an awkward member and, without it, the Union will be able to run its affairs more smoothly. But there are five strong reasons for keeping Britain inside the tent.The first is precisely because Britain is often prepared to be awkward, calling a spade a spade \u2014 for example, when it raised doubts about the common-currency project. Second, Britain has a track record of pushing for free-market reforms \u2014 both to open up the Union\u2019s market and cut trade deals with other economic blocs. Without the British voice, the European Union might become more protectionist, and that would be bad for its economy.Third, Britain accounts for 15 percent of the Union\u2019s gross domestic product. It now has the third-largest economy, after Germany and France. In 30 years, it could have the largest. If Britain cuts itself off even partially from this single market, it will be badly hurt, but the rest will also suffer.Fourth, a Brexit would upset the bloc\u2019s internal dynamics. Many other countries would fear that the Union would become even more German-dominated. Berlin, meanwhile, would worry that southern states would find it easier to gang up against it.Finally, the Union\u2019s foreign and security policy would suffer a severe setback. It is easy to mock the current approach, which has little to show for itself. But one only has to look at the Union\u2019s unstable neighborhood \u2014 Ukraine and Russia to the East, North Africa and the Middle East to the south \u2014 to appreciate that it is going to need to get serious in the next decade or so. Without Britain, the bloc would have less clout.So how can European leaders cut the risk of Brexit? For a start, Mr. Cameron needs to play the European Union diplomacy game better. That means quickly making peace with Mr. Juncker. Why not invite him to Downing Street? The prime minister should also propose a heavy hitter as Britain\u2019s own European Union commissioner \u2014 somebody like William Hague or Michael Howard, both former leaders of his party.Meanwhile, Mr. Cameron needs to build more alliances. He made the error of relying too much on Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Britain also needs allies in Italy, France, Spain, Poland and other nations.The other Union leaders offered Britain a couple of concessions at the summit meeting last week. They said they would review the system of nominating future commission presidents. This is important because the way in which Mr. Juncker was chosen amounted to a power grab by the European Parliament. The leaders should make clear that this will not set a precedent. The summit meeting also interpreted the phrase in the European Union treaty calling for ever closer union among the peoples of Europe as \u201crespecting the wish of those who do not want to deepen\u201d integration any further. That formulation will not satisfy British euro-skeptics, for whom the phrase is a bugbear. But with a few tweaks. this olive twig could become a full olive branch.If Mr. Cameron does propose a heavy-hitter as Britain\u2019s commissioner, other leaders should respond by offering that person a top job. They should also sharpen up the work program they have sketched for the next five years. The core of this should be: a renewed drive to complete the single market; free trade deals with the United States and Japan; a revamped energy policy; building up nonbank finance so it can take up the slack as banks shrink; and cutting regulations.A plan like this would not just be good for growth and jobs in the bloc, it would help those Britons who want to stay in the Union make the case for doing so in any future referendum.

{"Headline": "Economy in First Quarter Was Worse Than Everybody Thought", "Date": "2014-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Recovery in Need of a RecoveryThe beginning of the year was not just bad for the United States economy; it was \u2014 on paper at least \u2014 the worst quarter since the last recession ended five years ago.What makes the sharply negative number all the more stunning is that it did not feel like an economic contraction at all in the first quarter. Employers kept adding jobs at a reasonably healthy pace. Many measures of business activity and consumer confidence were stable.The saving grace of the weak report is that G.D.P., while the broadest measure of economic activity, is also among the most backward-looking. After all, the period covered by this report ended nearly three months ago. More contemporaneous measures of the economy have looked healthier, particularly job creation. Markets were hardly fazed by the negative report, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index up half a percent Wednesday.Still, though 2014 is only around halfway over, the brutal math of G.D.P. means that the nation now looks consigned to another year of sluggish growth at best \u2014 and that\u2019s true even if there is a pickup over the remainder of the year. For example, if the economy were to grow at a 4 percent pace each of the three final quarters of 2014 \u2014 a level only attained twice in the last five years, and never in consecutive quarters \u2014 the overall growth rate for 2014 would still work out to only a tepid 2.2 percent.\u201cThe economy now must attempt to dig itself out from an even larger hole than previously expected,\u201d Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist of Sterne Agee, said in a research note.The sharp contraction was driven by an unlikely combination of negative forces that conspired to turn what had once seemed set to be another quarter of so-so growth into a considerably gloomier experience. Economists had expected the revised number to show a 1.8 percent annual rate of contraction, and were caught off-guard by the far more negative result. The key thing they missed: consumer spending, the mainstay of economic activity, was far weaker than either government numbers or private analysts had previously thought, particularly spending on health care.Previous G.D.P. numbers, released in late May, showed that health care spending contributed 1 percentage point to economic growth. The new report now finds that health care spending actually subtracted 0.16 of a percentage point from the growth rate. The health care spending data in G.D.P. are a measure of how much President Obama\u2019s sweeping health law is reshaping health care spending patterns, and it is now showing opposite results from those reported two months ago, when the first-quarter data was initially released.On one hand, the health reform effort aims to increase the number of Americans with health care coverage, which would tend to increase reported spending. On the other hand, it also aims to reduce costs, which could depress the sector\u2019s contribution to economic growth (even if desirable over the longer-term).Analysts expect the contribution of health care to the overall G.D.P. to be bumpy and unpredictable in the quarters ahead because of uncertainty about the law.\u201cLooking forward, the volatility in the measurement of health care services represents a risk to our G.D.P. forecasts,\u201d Doug Handler, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note. \u201cSince this volatility is not business-cycle related, its impact should be heavily discounted in assessing the general health of the economy.\u201dOther causes of the first-quarter contraction were already well known. Businesses pulled back on their inventories, which subtracted 1.7 percentage points from growth (an earlier estimate had been a loss of 1.6 percentage points). The good news is that the negative inventory swing, if underlying demand stays solid, may encourage companies to rebuild their stocks of goods in the future.And the rough winter weather did not help many categories of business activity. It slowed home-building activity (residential investment subtracted 0.13 of a percentage point) and commercial building work (which subtracted 0.22 of a percentage point).But the fact that the economy as a whole could show such a sharply negative result thanks to a few idiosyncratic factors is also a reflection of the underlying weakness in the economy.When growth is strong, even some bad weather and an unexpected inventory swing do not cause a contraction in the economy, or at least not a contraction on the scale reported for the first quarter of 2014. But because the pattern of growth has been roughly in the 2 percent range or a bit below for years now, the economy is more vulnerable to shocks that leave activity in negative territory.The Upshot presents news, analysis\nand graphics about politics\nand policy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "JetBlue Adds Flat-Bed Seats", "Date": "2014-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 For the well-heeled traveler flying between New York and Los Angeles, for whom onboard Wi-Fi, roomy leather seats, a Zagat-approved meal and a piping hot washcloth are not enough, airlines have an announcement.Attention, passengers: Your bed is ready.As inches have been shaved off the seat cushions for coach travelers and surcharges have padded to their bills in an effort to please shareholders, major carriers are turning their attention to the latest must-have on a cross-country flight, a seat that folds out into a flat bed.JetBlue, the airline whose egalitarian, all-coach seating promised to bring the humanity back to flying, became the latest to offer such pampering with the debut of its Mint service last week. It now offers 16 of the lie-flat seats \u2014 four of which are closed off as a private suite \u2014 on some of its New York-to-Los Angeles flights, with service to San Francisco scheduled to begin in late October.JetBlue joins what has become an accelerating race to the top in domestic air travel. Delta announced last week that all eight of its daily nonstops between New York and Los Angeles are being equipped with the beds, which have been de rigueur for the discerning international traveler for at least a decade. American, United and Virgin America have all been aggressively expanding their lie-flat offerings.For JetBlue, the shift to first class is a striking change in strategy, and in some ways in its culture. Since it started service in 2000, JetBlue distinguished itself just as much by what it offered \u2014 satellite TV and radio on every seat back, leather seats, the most legroom of any carrier and blue potato chips \u2014 as what it did not \u2014 a first-class or business-class section.But in recent years its profit margins began to shrink as fuel costs rose and other airlines turned their attention to the front of the cabin. It has left JetBlue, analysts and executives say, with no choice but to chase the high-end market.\u201cNew York and L.A. are the richest markets out there and there\u2019s just a lot of people willing to pay for this,\u201d said Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst. \u201cSo you either claim your fair share of those people or you leave it on the table for others to take, and airlines can\u2019t afford to leave that kind of money on the table for others to steal.\u201dDavid Barger, JetBlue\u2019s chief executive, agreed, saying that with an improved economy, he was afraid of losing loyal customers who wanted a more pampered experience for cross-country flights.\u201cIt forced us to get in the game or get out,\u201d said Mr. Barger, who added that he also saw a market niche. \u201cFirst-class and business fares are rude. There\u2019s no reason to have to pay $3,000 for a lie-flat experience.\u201dMint service begins at $599, far below the $1,500 to $1,800 that major carriers charge for one-way, first-class tickets between New York and Los Angeles. But the introductory fares will rise once JetBlue gets a better handle on the market, Mr. Barger said. By early next year, Mr. Barger said, JetBlue should have 11 of the new Airbus A321 aircraft in operation, giving it 276 premium seats to sell.This is no small move. Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst, said each new seat could cost $50,000 and up, depending on what an airline orders.Mr. Harteveldt said the Mint service was a significant step in the evolution of JetBlue away from being a discount airline committed to the coach traveler.\u201cThis is the most tangible form of showing that the Jet Blue that\u2019s flying now is a very different one from the airline that started almost 15 years ago,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. \u201cThis move shows a desire to compete with a product that matters, but in a very focused way. This is not going to show up on a flight from New York to Buffalo or Boston to San Juan. It\u2019s a smart move.\u201dMr. Barger said JetBlue was targeting small-business owners and executives, not necessarily the high-end corporate traveler. Specifically, someone like Mary Alice Foote, a marketing executive who returned home on Thursday from a trip to New York in a Mint class seat.By the time Ms. Foote landed, she had texted her boss, raving about the experience, which included scrambled eggs, French toast and watermelon salad for breakfast, watching a movie on a 15-inch video screen, and being handed a parting gift \u2014 skin care products from Birchbox.\u201cIt was great,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t go back. It was like first class.\u201dBut a sampling of passengers awaiting a flight from Los Angeles to Kennedy International Airport illustrated the tricky balance JetBlue faces as it tries to improve its bottom line while holding onto its identity.Lesley Palmer, who was traveling to visit her daughter in Brooklyn, said she flew JetBlue because it had the cheapest fare, but her savings were gobbled up after she paid an additional $160 for extra legroom to accommodate her large frame.Diana Vachier, of Long Beach, N.Y., said JetBlue was not what it once was.\u201cThey had a great plan,\u201d Ms. Vachier said of the low prices and customer comforts. \u201cBut then they start to squeeze you. Little by little, the price creeps up. They\u2019re charging now for more legroom. It makes you resentful.\u201dSuch sentiments about JetBlue are not uncommon, Mr. Mann said.\u201cThat airline has become like everybody else in every way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer low fare, it\u2019s no longer simple pricing, and if you look at some of the customer comments, it\u2019s no longer a breath of fresh air.\u201dAnd Ms. Vachier isn\u2019t imagining being squeezed. To make room for the beds, JetBlue reduced the coach seat spacing to 33 inches from 34 inches, though the airline says that is still two to six inches more than other airlines have.Mr. Barger acknowledges that such complaints are inevitable. He also points out much has changed since the airline was founded, like oil prices, which are about four times what they were back then. Still, he says his airline remains committed to what he calls its \u201ccore experience\u201d \u2014 refusing to refer to the cabin as coach.The new planes with Mint class have \u201cnew seats, new colors, new lighting and full broadband Wi-Fi,\u201d Mr. Barger said. \u201cThat product is what I\u2019m equally excited about. It\u2019s not just about what\u2019s behind the curtain.\u201dIn the coming months, JetBlue and other airlines will be analyzing the popularity and the profitability of the lie-flat experience. They will examine if there is a market in Boston and Seattle, and how robust the one in San Francisco is, searching out places where the customers may be lying flat, but the profit margins are not.An article on the Itineraries page on Tuesday about JetBlue\u2019s addition of first-class seats that convert to flat beds gave an outdated title for Dave Barger. He is the company\u2019s chief executive, no longer its president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breaking the Law to Go Online in Iran", "Date": "2014-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 WHEN Anthony Bourdain posted a cryptic message on Facebook at the end of May that he and his television crew would be off the social media grid for the next 10 days because they were \u201ctruly going to #PartsUnknown,\u201d his fans around the world were intrigued. Was he shooting his CNN show (titled \u201cParts Unknown\u201d) in a remote desert or on top of a snowy Himalayan peak? Ten days later, Mr. Bourdain posted a picture of himself sitting with a small glass of tea at a traditional Iranian teahouse in Isfahan, and it was immediately clear why the famous chef and TV show host had had no other option but to maintain radio silence. In Iran, the government officially blocks access to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and almost all other social media platforms. Any attempt to bypass this block by using a virtual private network (VPN) connection or other software solutions is illegal. Numerous reports indicate that Iranian authorities restrict access to thousands of American and European websites, particularly those of international news sources, and even throttle down Internet connections to limit the ability of Iranians to surf the rest of the Web.This suppressive approach, zealously pursued by hard-liners and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, was ridiculed two weeks ago by none other than the minister of culture, Ali Jannati. Addressing members of Iran\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Jannati criticized the practice of blocking websites, social media and popular messaging apps. \u201cIn social media and the virtual world, we still do not know if we are supposed to block Viber and WhatsApp or not,\u201d Mr. Jannati said, according to the news site Al-Monitor. \u201cThere was a time we had problems with video. There was even a time we had issue with the fax machine,\u201d he said.\u201cApparently we have to confront every new phenomenon and after time has passed, then accept it,\u201d Mr. Jannati continued. \u201cWe always want to have a 20-year distance with the world. Let\u2019s at least move along with the world.\u201dMeanwhile, several top Iranian officials enjoy what they deny to their citizens: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, President Hassan Rouhani and the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, apparently have accounts on Facebook or Twitter, with Mr. Zarif attracting nearly 900,000 Facebook followers to his page in Farsi.Mr. Rouhani has staked his reputation on the success of Iran\u2019s talks with the so-called P5-plus-1 countries \u2014 the permanent United Nations Security Council members Russia, China, Britain, France and the United States, plus Germany \u2014 on a possible nuclear deal before July 20. A deal would ease international sanctions on Iran and allow Western companies to return, giving the struggling Iranian economy a long-needed boost. The reintegration of Iran into the world economy would also require allowing unfiltered access to the Internet and international satellite television broadcasts.The Iranian authorities admit, reluctantly, that it is almost impossible to rein in Iranians who are eager to know about the outside world and know how to use alternative means to gain access to the web. \u201cFour million Iranians are on Facebook, and we have restricted it,\u201d Mr. Jannati said in a speech in March in Tehran. \u201cThe preservation of Islamic values cannot be used as an excuse to stop the growth of something in the country.\u201dMr. Jannati also cited the 71 percent of Tehran residents who have satellite dishes and watch foreign television, which is also illegal. \u201cThis means that millions in the capital are committing a crime every evening,\u201d he said. The feedback we get from viewers, listeners and website visitors also confirms strong interest from Iranians to know what is really happening in the country they have been taught to call the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d \u2014 whether we report on President Obama\u2019s speech at West Point, or a recent visit by American Catholic bishops to Qom to start an interfaith dialogue with top Iranian ayatollahs on the need to restrict nuclear weapons, or Goldman Sachs\u2019s predictions for the Iranian national soccer team at the World Cup.We have to tweak our web content to accommodate low download speeds in Tehran, Mashhad or Shiraz, and we look for ways to help Iranian students win a cat-and-mouse game with authorities over the use of VPNs and other anti-filtering tools. Our experience confirms what \u201cThe Iran Primer\u201d finds: Despite the Iranian authorities\u2019 efforts to shield them from Western influences, \u201cIran\u2019s young are better educated and more worldly than any previous generation\u201d and \u201cmost are exposed to global media, ideas and culture through satellite television and the Internet.\u201dBefore leaving Iran, Mr. Bourdain tweeted: \u201cNever would have guessed that of all countries in world, my crew and I would be treated so well everywhere, by total strangers in #Iran.\u201d It\u2019s a pity that Iranians weren\u2019t able to read these kind words about their own hospitality on Twitter without breaking their country\u2019s law.Setareh Derakhshesh is the director of the Voice of America Persian Service.

{"Headline": "Agricultural Output Climbed in 2013, Recovering From Drought", "Date": "2014-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsAGRICULTURE is a small part of the United States economy, but last year it was the best part.The output of the agriculture sector grew 16.4 percent after inflation last year, the fastest rise for the sector since at least 1998 and far faster than any other part of the economy. The nation\u2019s gross domestic product grew just 1.8 percent, while the second-fastest growing sector, the information industry, rose 3.2 percent.Last week, the government released its estimates of state economic growth in 2013. North Dakota led the pack with a growth rate of 9.7 percent. Alaska was the only state whose economy declined, shrinking by 2.1 percent, largely because of declining oil production.The economy of the District of Columbia also declined, but that was because of cuts in government spending. North Dakota benefited from its rising production of shale oil, but it was also helped by the fact that its agriculture sector amounts to 12.9 percent of the state\u2019s economy, more than that of any other state except South Dakota.By contrast, agriculture accounted for just 1.6 percent of the country\u2019s overall output in 2013. But that was the largest share in recent years, up from a recent low of 0.9 percent in 2006. The agriculture sector includes forestry, fishing and hunting as well as farming, but farming is much larger than the other categories.Last year, the government changed the way it calculated G.D.P. figures, including counting research and development spending as investments rather than as consumption. It revised historical figures only back to 1997, so earlier years\u2019 output and growth figures for agriculture are not comparable.Mitch Morehart, an economist with the Agriculture Department, said the strong growth in agriculture reflected a recovery in production for some crops after a drought in 2012, as well as strong production and rising prices for livestock. This year, he said, it appears that agriculture is not doing nearly as well.Over all, the economies of the 10 states that are most dependent on agriculture grew at an average annual rate of 3.4 percent in 2013, while the 10 states that are least dependent on the farm economy grew at an average rate of 1.3 percent.California is by far the largest agricultural producer, accounting for $46.7 billion, or 17 percent, of the total national agricultural output of $269.1 billion. But the state is so large that agriculture makes up only 2.1 percent of its output, less than 16 other states. Iowa, which ranks second in dollar value at $16.1 billion, depends on agriculture for almost 10 percent of its total economic output.The 2013 surge in agriculture ended a string of three years in which that sector did not do as well as the overall United States economy. But since 1998, agriculture outperformed the rest of the economy in nine of the 15 years. During that stretch, agriculture grew at an annual rate of 4 percent, double the 2 percent average for the national economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "217,000 Jobs Added, Nudging Payrolls to Levels Before the Crisis ", "Date": "2014-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a series of peaks and valleys that confounded optimists and pessimists alike this year, the American economy seems to have settled into a healthy, if not spectacular, pace of job creation.\u201cThis is a solid report,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. For the fourth consecutive month, he noted, employers added more than 200,000 positions, the first time that has happened in 14 years.As good as that might sound, surpassing the previous high-water mark in terms of payroll employment is cold comfort for recent graduates and other new entrants into the work force, as well as for the legions of Americans who lost their jobs in the Great Recession. While payrolls may be back to where they were before the downturn, the working age population has risen by roughly 15 million over the same period.That seeming paradox \u2014 a steadily improving economy with faster job growth even as millions of potential workers remain stuck on the sidelines \u2014 is among the biggest challenges now facing politicians in Washington and policy makers at the Federal Reserve. The latest numbers highlight the problem. The unemployment rate remained flat last month at 6.3 percent, the lowest since September of 2008. But the portion of the population in the work force did not budge either, remaining stuck at 62.8 percent, a depressed level last seen in the late 1970s. Although retiring baby boomers are responsible for some of the decline in participation in recent years, most experts say they believe a substantial amount is because people are giving up the search for a job entirely and dropping out of the work force. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten the unemployment rate down,\u201d said Byron Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners and a Wall Street strategist for decades. \u201cBut are we really creating enough jobs to bring people back into the work force? We\u2019re not and we need to create more. We\u2019re still a long way from where we need to be.\u201dThe varying fates of workers in the recovery was also evident from the data on joblessness by educational level. While unemployment among college graduates dropped by 0.1 percent, to 3.2 percent in May, it increased by 0.2 percent, to 9.1 percent for high school dropouts, and by 0.2 percent, to 6.5 percent for workers with only a high school diploma. Still, experts said that the report was strong enough to keep the Fed on its current trajectory of gradually reducing monthly bond purchases aimed at stimulating the economy, while avoiding the danger that an improving labor market will create upward pressure on inflation, always a worry for central bankers. For example, average hourly earnings rose by 5 cents, to $24.38, in May, the Labor Department said, and are up 2.1 percent in the last 12 months, not much more than underlying rate of inflation. \u201cThis is a Goldilocks report,\u201d said Scott G. Clemons, chief investment strategist for private banking at Brown Brothers Harriman, referring to the not-too-hot, not-too-cold balance between faster growth on the one hand, and the risk of inflation on the other. \u201cThere\u2019s been some latent concern about whether we are seeing real strength or just a recovery from the winter, but I think this is for real.\u201d Wall Street was also enthusiastic Friday. Investors were pleased by the uptick in hiring and the lack of the kind of wage inflation that might prompt the Fed to raise short-term interest rates sooner than the current expectation of mid-2015. As has been the recent pattern, stocks surged again on Friday, lifting both the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average to new nominal highs. The S.&P. 500 has gained 5.5 percent so far in 2014, and is up just over 20 percent from where it was a year ago. Despite a boom in corporate profit and the surging stock market, many big companies are only now beginning to gingerly increase the size of their work force; generally, they had preferred to pay existing staff for more hours if demand materialized rather than add new positions. That is one reason the length of the workweek for nonsupervisory manufacturing workers hit 42.1 hours in May, the longest since World War II, even as the typical workweek for all workers was unchanged. \u201cWe would rather have employees work an extra half-day or a few more hours than incur the costs of adding a new worker,\u201d said James S. Metcalf, chief executive of USG, which makes building materials like the Sheetrock brand of drywall. \u201cDemand is increasing, but it is still very choppy.\u201dThe pace of hiring at USG\u2019s 39 plants in the United States is beginning to tick up, though. The company hired 25 workers in May, and plans to add several hundred more to its domestic work force of approximately 7,400 by the end of the year. Three out of four of the new hires this year have been for hourly production positions, with the rest in salaried jobs in engineering, logistics and research. Some parts of the country are much busier than others, Mr. Metcalf added, with Texas and the Southwest doing the best, while the Midwest grows much more slowly. Nationally, he said, \u201cit\u2019s nothing you\u2019d strike up the band for but this is a slow, steady recovery. We still have to be convinced that the higher demand we\u2019re seeing is sustainable.\u201d Even as private employers have gradually increased hiring in the recovery, the work force at government agencies and the Postal Service has shrunk considerably. Total government employment is still down by more than one million from where it was four years ago.That pattern largely continued in May, with the public sector adding just 1,000 positions, while private employers hired 216,000 new employees. Sectors with the most robust hiring included professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and education and health care. As Michelle Meyer, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, noted, that is down from a peak of 17.2 percent but still high by historical standards. Similarly, while the median duration of unemployment dipped to 14.6 weeks in May from 16 weeks in April, that is more than double the prerecession average of 7.1 weeks.\u201cThe decline in the unemployment rate this year has exceeded our expectations,\u201d Ms. Meyer explained. \u201cThat said, there is still a great deal of underutilization in the labor market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let North Korea Collapse", "Date": "2014-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW YORK \u2014 North Korea is a threat that keeps on threatening. Satellite imagery recently revealed increased activity at the Punggye-ri nuclear site. The government in Pyongyang appears to have completed preliminary steps for a fourth nuclear test. Its ballistic missile program continues to advance. And the man with his finger on the button is the 31-year-old Kim Jong-un, who seems even more erratic than his notorious predecessors.So far, the United States, South Korea, Japan and China \u2014 the main countries with a stake in stability on the Korean Peninsula \u2014 have responded by adopting a policy of soft containment. Even as they have tried to curb Pyongyang\u2019s excesses, they have allowed the regime to stay in place: They fear that its demise would be too destabilizing and that the peninsula\u2019s reunification would mean crippling economic and social costs for South Korea.But this is a blinkered view, because the long-term benefits of North Korea\u2019s collapse, both strategic and economic, far outweigh the short-term costs.The fall of the Kim government would generate significant problems at first, most immediately how to secure North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons, demobilize its vast army, provide basic public services to its people and manage refugee flows. But the advantages would emerge very soon, especially in terms of security.Some 25 million North Koreans, including 80,000 to 120,000 prisoners in slave-labor camps, would be released from the grip of one of the world\u2019s most repressive regimes. The states that Pyongyang threatens would also be relieved: South Korea, which today is at risk of commando or conventional military operations from the North; Japan, which is within range of missile strikes; the United States, which worries that it will get dragged into a conventional war on the peninsula, or that Pyongyang may sell off nuclear material.Even China, a putative ally of the Kim regime, would benefit from its fall: Beijing would no longer have to supply the North with fuel, food and other goods, and pay the diplomatic cost of supporting a pariah state.Even more significant would be the economic opportunities for South Korea. The total bill for rebuilding North Korea and integrating it with the South could reach $2 trillion \u2014 more even than the cost of Germany\u2019s reunification after the Cold War, estimated at $1.9 trillion. But some of that expense would be offset by immediate savings on South Korea\u2019s defense budget, some $32 billion this year alone.Reunification would bring a demographic jolt. South Korea\u2019s population is aging fast, thanks to an average life expectancy of 81 years and a birth rate of only 1.2 children per woman. If current trends continue, the number of South Koreans aged between 15 and 64 will start to decline in 2017, and by 2030, so will the population overall.The population of North Korea is younger and more fertile. The median age in the North is 33.4 years, compared with 40.2 years in the South. With unification, North Korea would bring more than 17 million potential workers to the 36 million in the South.There would be other economic gains, too. South Korea currently imports nearly all of its energy and mineral needs. North Korea has vast deposits of coal, uranium, magnesite and rare-earth metals \u2014 together reportedly valued at $6 trillion \u2014 which it cannot currently exploit. Technology from the South could unlock these resources, boosting the economy of the entire peninsula.Over time, a unified Korea could emerge as a regional consumer and industrial powerhouse \u2014 much like Germany, which today is the strongest economy in Europe despite having had to manage the costs and upheaval of merging West and East a quarter century ago. Goldman Sachs predicted in 2009 that if the Korean Peninsula were reunified, within 30 to 40 years it could overtake France, Germany and even Japan in terms of G.D.P., and become \u201cthe Germany of Asia.\u201dConsidering all these benefits, the United States and its allies must revise their approach to North Korea. Rather than continue to prop up a government they worry might topple over on its own, they should pursue a tougher version of containment, knowing that that may accelerate the collapse of the Kim regime.This harder policy would entail trying to cut off all the regime\u2019s illicit sources of revenues, including drug smuggling, currency counterfeiting and exports of military equipment, while expanding sanctions to freeze all of Pyongyang\u2019s overseas bank accounts. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved legislation along these lines on May 29; that proposal deserves to become law. The United States government should also do more to undermine Pyongyang\u2019s hold on its population by increasing broadcasting by Radio Free Asia and Voice of America.All this may seem like a hard sell with the other states that are strategically invested in the region, especially China. But Washington could give assurances to Beijing that following unification, no American troops would be stationed north of the current demilitarized zone \u2014 or anywhere on the peninsula, if that\u2019s what it takes to win China\u2019s support. Nationalistic South Koreans, once relieved of the threat from the North, might insist on this anyway.The fall of the Kim government may be an unnerving prospect, but it is a necessary step toward the reunification of the Korean Peninsula, a very worthy goal. Thus the United States, South Korea, Japan and China must abandon their soft-containment policy, which has artificially prolonged the regime\u2019s existence. They should not be careful what they wish for.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Growth Has Been Good for Decades. So Why Hasn\u2019t Poverty Declined?", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncome InequalityThe surest way to fight poverty is to achieve stronger economic growth. That, anyway, is a view embedded in the thinking of a lot of politicians and economists.In Kennedy\u2019s era, that had the benefit of being true. From 1959 to 1973, the nation\u2019s economy per person grew 82 percent, and that was enough to drive the proportion of the poor population from 22 percent to 11 percent.But over the last generation in the United States, that simply hasn\u2019t happened. Growth has been pretty good, up 147 percent per capita. But rather than decline further, the poverty rate has bounced around in the 12 to 15 percent range \u2014 higher than it was even in the early 1970s. The mystery of why \u2014 and how to change that \u2014 is one of the most fundamental challenges in the nation\u2019s fight against poverty.\u201cIt used to be that as G.D.P. per capita grew, poverty declined in lock step,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at E.P.I. and an author of the study. \u201cThere was a very tight relationship between overall growth and fewer and fewer Americans living in poverty. Starting in the \u203270s, that link broke.\u201dNow, one shouldn\u2019t interpret that too literally. The 1959 to 1973 period might be an unfair benchmark. The Great Society social safety net programs were being put in place, and they may have had a poverty-lowering effect separate from that of the overall economic trends. In other words, it may be simply that during that time, strong growth and a falling poverty rate happened to take place simultaneously for unrelated reasons. And there presumably is some level of poverty below which the official poverty rate will never fall, driven by people whose problems run much deeper than economics.But the facts still cast doubt on the notion that growth alone will solve America\u2019s poverty problem.If you are committed to the idea that poor families need to work to earn a living, this has been a great three decades. For households in the bottom 20 percent of earnings in the United States \u2014 in 2012, that meant less than $14,687 a year \u2014 the share of income from wages, benefits and tax credits has risen from 57.5 percent of their total income in 1979 to 69.7 percent in 2010.The percentage of their income from public benefits, including Medicaid, food stamps, Social Security and unemployment insurance, has fallen in that time.The fact that more of poor families\u2019 income is coming from wages doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re getting paid more, though. In fact, based on the E.P.I.'s analysis of data from the Census Bureau, it appears that what income gains they are seeing are coming from working more hours, not from higher hourly pay.Indeed, if you adjust for the higher number of hours worked, over the 1979 to 2007 period (selected to avoid the effects of the steep recession that began in 2008), hourly pay for the bottom 20 percent of households rose only 3.2 percent. Total, not per year. In other words, in nearly three decades, these lower-income workers saw no meaningful gain in what they were paid for an hour of labor. Their overall inflation-adjusted income rose a bit, but mainly because they put in more hours of work.The researchers at E.P.I. also looked at demographic factors that contribute to poverty, including race, education levels and changes in family structure (such as the number of one-parent versus two-parent households). This look at the data also shows rising inequality as the biggest factor in contributing to the poverty rate, dwarfing those other shifts.Debates over what kind of social welfare system the United States ought to have are always polarizing, from the creation of the Great Society in the 1960s to the Clinton welfare reforms of the 1990s to the Paul Ryan budgets of this era. Conservatives tend to attribute the persistence of poverty, even amid economic growth, to the perverse incentives that a welfare state creates against working.But the reality is that low-income workers are putting in more hours on the job than they did a generation ago \u2014 and the financial rewards for doing so just haven\u2019t increased.That\u2019s the real lesson of the data: If you want to address poverty in the United States, it\u2019s not enough to say that you need to create better incentives for lower-income people to work. You also have to devise strategies that make the benefits of a stronger economy show up in the wages of the people on the edge of poverty, who need it most desperately.The Upshot presents news, analysis and graphics about politics and policy.\nnytimes.com/upshot Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Staying True to Native Grapes", "Date": "2014-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesOf all the historical wine-producing countries, Portugal is the most overlooked.Other countries mostly unrecognized for their wines 25 years ago have been welcomed to the globalized wine economy: Greece, Austria, a re-energized Hungary. France and Italy have always held attention, but little-known regions within both countries have emerged, to acclaim. Same with Spain.But Portugal? Port will always have its niche, and so will Madeira, but when it comes to nonfortified wine, Portugal continues to be largely ignored, and often unfairly.This is partly because the Portuguese, to their great credit, have largely refused to emphasize popular international grapes like cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, merlot and sauvignon blanc at the expense of their myriad indigenous offerings.Such internationalization, sadly, was once a proven formula for gaining worldwide attention. But the focus has shifted to what is distinctively local, and thankfully, American wine drinkers may have gotten past the point of being drawn in by some 100-point cabernet from Portugal.It may also be that the Portuguese language poses something of an obstacle for Americans, who may intuitively understand that, say, Italy\u2019s bianco and Spain\u2019s blanco are white wines, but may not make the same linguistic leap when confronted with branco, the Portuguese term for white. Frequently, the response when confronted with such unfamiliar terms is to move on to something more recognizable.I had heard a few other recent rhapsodies upon the quality of Portuguese whites, and concluded that they were well worth investigating. So the panel gathered to sample 20 from recent vintages, hoping for a few of our own bolts of enlightenment.I can\u2019t say that any of us felt the thrill of a discovery, though I found the wines pleasing and intriguing. As is often the case with Portuguese reds, all the whites were made from indigenous Portuguese grapes, yet none struck us as especially distinctive in the way that carricante seems unique to Mount Etna or furmint to Hungary. Quite a few of the wines were made in the modern fashion, fermented in steel tanks and bottled young to preserve freshness and aromas.Our No. 1 bottle, the 2012 Lu\u00eds Pato from the Beira Atl\u00e2ntico region, was in this style. It was made primarily of the Maria Gomes grape, Portugal\u2019s most common white grape, also known as fern\u00e3o pires. It was tangy and delicious, spicy, herbal and intended for early drinking. At just $13, it was our best value. You could go through a lot of this wine in the summer.Other wines saw time in barrels and were more capable of aging, like our No. 3 bottle, the 2012 branco from Quinta de Foz de Arouce, which happened to be the wine that caught Mr. Kramer\u2019s imagination, though it was the 2010, with a couple more years of age, that moved him to the Burgundy comparison.The \u201912, made entirely from the cerceal grape (not related to sercial, a constituent in Madeira), was lively with complex fruit and herbal flavors and the sort of inviting texture that comes from barrel aging \u2014 mostly old barrels, which did not impart flavors. I look forward to drinking this wine in a few years. It was also one of the more expensive in the tasting at $37.Other noteworthy wines included the No. 2 bottle, the rich, fleshy 2012 Quinta do Sagrado from the Douro, a blend of four grapes fermented in steel tanks; the No. 4 2012 Vadio from Bairrada in the Atlantic midsection, a somewhat rustic, pleasantly bitter wine; and the No. 5, a refreshing 2012 Casa de Mouraz from the D\u00e3o, inland from Bairrada, made entirely of the encruzado grape.I would not presume to offer definitive conclusions after this tasting, other than these wines absolutely bear further research. I have no doubt they will reward deeper dives, particularly into the more promising regions for whites, which seem to be the coastal areas of Bairrada and Beira Atl\u00e2ntico, and the Douro.I can say that if you like mainstream Italian whites, many of the less expensive bottles in this tasting will offer a similar sense of dry, fruity refreshment. If you like more-complex sorts of wine, like, dare I say, white Burgundy, then a barrel-aged bottle like the Foz de Arouce may prove intriguing.It\u2019s fair to say that the Portuguese wine industry is well along in its transition to focusing on wines that can be marketed around the world. What that means for its white wines is still in the process of shaking out.Tasting ReportWhat the stars mean: Ratings, up to four stars, reflect the panel\u2019s reaction to the wines, which were tasted with names and vintages concealed. The wines represent a selection generally available in good retail shops and restaurants and on the Internet. Prices are those paid in the New York region.Tasting coordinator: Bernard KirschAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Historical Blinders", "Date": "2014-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAt a time when constructive relations between Japan and South Korea are more important than ever to Asian security, the two countries, allies of the United States, have been unable to put a difficult history behind them. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely to change soon given the release on Friday of a Japanese report on World War II sex slaves. Many historians outside of Japan agree that the Japanese military forced women to work in brothels, yet Japanese nationalists continue to insist the women were prostitutes and were not forced into servitude by the authorities. Japanese nationalists will undoubtedly use the report to push the government to retract the apology. It\u2019s time Mr. Abe made it clear to his country and to the world that the \u201cdeniers\u201d are wrong. His continued willingness to play to that political fringe is interfering with Japan\u2019s ability to carry on its leading role in the region. Any reasonable American strategy for managing China\u2019s increasingly aggressive actions in Asia depends heavily on cooperation with Japan and South Korea. This is also an especially awkward time for Japan to leave any doubts about the issue of its wartime sex slaves. There has been increasing and proper attention focused by the international community on sexual violence in armed conflict; governments and human rights groups have demanded that offenders be prosecuted and victims cared for. At a conference on that issue in London this month, the head of the Japanese delegation, Nobuo Kishi, Mr. Abe\u2019s brother, said: \u201cSexual violence is a crime. It is important to eliminate the culture of impunity against the perpetrators and to change our mind-sets.\u201d As a democracy and the world\u2019s third-largest economy, Japan cannot be seen as trying to rewrite its past.

{"Headline": "Obama on Obama on Climate", "Date": "2014-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWHEN it comes to dealing with the world\u2019s climate and energy challenges I have a simple rule: change America, change the world.If America raises its clean energy standards, not only will others follow \u2014 others who have hid behind our inaction \u2014 we\u2019ll also stimulate our industry to invent more of the clean air, clean power and energy efficiency systems, and move them down the cost curve faster, so U.S. companies will be leaders in this next great global industry and American consumers will be the first to benefit. That is why the new Environmental Protection Agency rules President Obama proposed last week to curb carbon emissions from power plants are so pivotal. You can\u2019t make power systems greener without making them smarter \u2014 smarter materials, software or design. One new ruling will not change the world \u2014 and we have to be careful that this one doesn\u2019t replace our addiction to coal with an addiction to natural gas alone. But coming at a time when clean energy technologies are becoming more competitive, and when awareness of climate change is becoming more pervasive, this E.P.A. ruling should give a real boost to clean power and efficiency innovation and make our country more resilient, healthy, secure \u2014 and respected.For starters, Obama is aware that we can\u2019t just keep burning oil, coal and gas until they run out. As the International Energy Agency warned, \u201cno more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050\u201d \u2014 unless carbon capture and storage technology is widely deployed \u2014 otherwise we\u2019ll bust through the limit of a 2 degree Celsius rise in average temperature that climate scientists believe will unleash truly disruptive ice melt, sea level rise and weather extremes. The rest has to stay in the ground, and we need to steadily find cleaner alternatives and more energy efficiency. I asked Obama if he agreed with that analysis.\u201cScience is science,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is no doubt that if we burned all the fossil fuel that\u2019s in the ground right now that the planet\u2019s going to get too hot and the consequences could be dire.\u201dSo we can\u2019t burn it all?\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to burn it all. Over the course of the next several decades, we\u2019re going to have to build a ramp from how we currently use energy to where we need to use energy. And we\u2019re not going to suddenly turn off a switch and suddenly we\u2019re no longer using fossil fuels, but we have to use this time wisely, so that you have a tapering off of fossil fuels replaced by clean energy sources that are not releasing carbon. ... But I very much believe in keeping that 2 [degree] Celsius target as a goal.\u201dIf that is so, your environmental supporters wonder why you keep touting how much we\u2019re still exploring for oil, coal and natural gas?\u201cWe have got to meet folks where they are,\u201d said Obama. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through, obviously, in the last five years, a tough economic crisis. ... I don\u2019t always lead with the climate change issue because if you right now are worried about whether you\u2019ve got a job or if you can pay the bills, the first thing you want to hear is how do I meet the immediate problem? One of the hardest things in politics is getting a democracy to deal with something now where the payoff is long term or the price of inaction is decades away. What we\u2019ve tried to do is continually find ways in which we can make progress, recognizing that we\u2019re not immediately going to get people to abandon the old gas-guzzler\u201d [because] \u201cthey can\u2019t afford an electric car.\u201dEvery morning you get a security briefing from the intelligence community on global threats; do you now also get the same on environmental threats?\u201cI do,\u201d said Obama. Science adviser \u201cJohn Holdren typically makes presentations when there are new findings,\u201d and his reports show that environmental stresses are now impacting both foreign and domestic policy. For instance, wildfires are now \u201cconsuming a larger and larger portion of the Department of Interior budget. And if we continue to fund fighting fires the same way we\u2019ve done in the past, all the money for everything else \u2014 for conservation, for maintenance of forests \u2014 all that money gets used up.\u201dBut the area he\u2019s just as worried about, said Obama, \u201cis how climate change could end up having profound national security implications in poorer countries. We\u2019re obviously concerned about drought in California or hurricanes and floods along our coastlines and the possibility of more powerful storms or more severe droughts. All of those things are bread-and-butter issues that touch on American families. But when you start seeing how these shifts can displace people \u2014 entire countries can be finding themselves unable to feed themselves and the potential incidence of conflict that arises out of that \u2014 that gets your attention. There\u2019s a reason why the quadrennial defense review \u2014 [which] the secretary of defense and the Joints Chiefs of Staff work on \u2014 identified climate change as one of our most significant national security problems. It\u2019s not just the actual disasters that might arise, it is the accumulating stresses that are placed on a lot of different countries and the possibility of war, conflict, refugees, displacement that arise from a changing climate.\u201dSyria couldn\u2019t manage a four-year drought when it had a government, and that drought helped fuel the uprising there, because the government did nothing for the people. Imagine what will happen if they have another prolonged drought and they\u2019ve destroyed half their country?\u201cWhich gives you a sense of what happens in a lot of these countries that are just barely hanging on,\u201d said Obama. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of margin for error, and that has national security implications. When people are hungry, when people are displaced, when there are a lot of young people, particularly young men, who are drifting without prospects for the future, the fertility of the soil for terrorism ends up being significant. And it can have an impact on us.\u201dWhat is the one thing you would still like to see us do to address climate change? Said Obama: put a price on carbon.The way we\u2019ve solved previous problems, like acid rain, he noted, \u201cwas that we said: \u2018We\u2019re going to charge you if you\u2019re releasing this stuff into the atmosphere, but we\u2019re going to let you figure out \u2014 with the marketplace and with the technology\u2019 \u201d how best to mitigate it. But \u201cyou can\u2019t keep dumping it out in the atmosphere and making everybody else pay for it. So if there\u2019s one thing I would like to see, it\u2019d be for us to be able to price the cost of carbon emissions. ... We\u2019ve obviously seen resistance from the Republican side of the aisle on that. And out of fairness, there\u2019s some Democrats who\u2019ve been concerned about it as well, because regionally they\u2019re very reliant on heavy industry and old-power plants. ... I still believe, though, that the more we can show the price of inaction \u2014 that billions and potentially trillions of dollars are going to be lost because we do not do something about it \u2014 ultimately leads us to be able to say, \u2018Let\u2019s go ahead and help the marketplace discourage this kind of activity.\u2019 \u201dWhere does natural gas fit in?After all, it can be a blessing and a curse. Natural gas emits only half the carbon dioxide of coal when burned, but if methane leaks when oil companies extract it from the ground in a sloppy manner \u2014 methane is far more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide \u2014 it can wipe out all the advantages of natural gas over coal.Natural gas, the president said, \u201cis a useful bridge\u201d to span \u201cwhere we are right now and where we hope to be \u2014 where we\u2019ve got entirely clean energy economies based around the world.\u201d Environmentalists, he added, \u201care right, though, to be concerned if it\u2019s done badly, then you end up having methane gas emitted. And we know how to do it properly. But right now what we\u2019ve got to do is make sure that there are industry standards that everybody is observing.\u201d That doesn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily mean that it has to be a national law,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could have a series of states working together \u2014 and, hopefully, industry working together \u2014 to make sure that the extraction of natural gas is done safely.\u201dDo you ever want to just go off on the climate deniers in Congress?\u201cYeah, absolutely,\u201d the president said with a laugh. \u201cLook, it\u2019s frustrating when the science is in front of us. ... We can argue about how. But let\u2019s not argue about what\u2019s going on. The science is compelling. ... The baseline fact of climate change is not something we can afford to deny. And if you profess leadership in this country at this moment in our history, then you\u2019ve got to recognize this is going to be one of the most significant long-term challenges, if not the most significant long-term challenge, that this country faces and that the planet faces. The good news is that the public may get out ahead of some of their politicians\u201d \u2014 as people start to see the cost of cleaning up for hurricanes like Sandy or the drought in California \u2014 and when \u201cthose start multiplying, then people start thinking, \u2018You know what? We\u2019re going to reward politicians who talk to us honestly and seriously about this problem.\u2019 \u201dThe president added: \u201cThe person who I consider to be the greatest president of all time, Abraham Lincoln, was pretty consistent in saying, \u2018With public opinion there\u2019s nothing I cannot do, and without public opinion there\u2019s nothing I can get done,\u2019 and so part of my job over these next two and a half years and beyond is trying to shift public opinion. And the way to shift public opinion is to really focus in on the fact that if we do nothing our kids are going to be worse off.\u201dThe trick, I argued, is to find that fine line between making people feel the problem is urgent, but not insoluble so they just say: If the end is nigh, let\u2019s party.\u201cThe most important thing is to guard against cynicism,\u201d responded the president. \u201cI want to make sure that everybody who\u2019s been watching this program or listening to this interview doesn\u2019t start concluding that, well, we\u2019re all doomed, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. There\u2019s a lot we can do about it. It\u2019s not going to happen as fast or as smoothly or as elegantly as we like, but, if we are persistent, we will make progress.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Key to Success: A Belief in a Future", "Date": "2014-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneCHICAGO \u2014 Tim Jackson\u2019s job is to convince young people that they have a stake in the future.The boys in his care at Harper High School, in one of the meanest neighborhoods on Chicago\u2019s South Side, all have harsh stories. One bouncy 15-year-old freshman tells me about his older brother, a high school dropout who smokes weed and does little else. Another teenager, still a sophomore at 17, knows what it\u2019s like to have had a gun pointed at his head in fourth grade.Almost half the students who enroll at Harper drop out within five years, one of the highest rates in the city. The school is in a part of town where a dispute over a stolen bicycle or a Facebook fight between two girls over a boy might end up with a dead teenager.Mr. Jackson\u2019s task, as a counselor for the Becoming a Man program at Harper, is to help prevent such tragedies. To do that, he trains the boys to avoid the ingrained, automatic responses: throwing a punch to avoid appearing like a punk or pulling a gun in a fistfight, which might land them in a bad place.And that requires providing these teenagers with an objective in life \u2014 a \u201cvisionary goal\u201d \u2014 worth saving themselves for.By stimulating the imaginations of the boys under his wing, Mr. Jackson may do more than keep them out of trouble. Sowing the aspirations of children in Chicago\u2019s most distressed neighborhoods could provide their best shot at moving up the ladder of opportunity.The income gap has surged past the peak reached in the Roaring Twenties, raising doubts over whether the engine of economic opportunity has been choked off for all except the most fortunate or talented, perpetuating vast inequalities.We have only a vague idea, however, of how the process may work. Economists identified what Alan B. Krueger, President Obama\u2019s former chief economic adviser, called \u201cThe Great Gatsby Curve.\u201d Economic mobility is weaker in countries (and states) with bigger income gaps. But nobody has explained convincingly how inequality today might gum up the cogs of opportunity for the next generation.Recent research by Melissa S. Kearney of the University of Maryland and Phillip B. Levine of Wellesley College provide what might be the missing link: Inequality may perpetuate itself down the generations by messing up the decisions of underprivileged youth.They challenge their results in many ways, but find nothing that could explain away inequality\u2019s effect. The dropout gap is not because of differences in school spending or differences in incarceration rates. Measures of segregation by income or race don\u2019t account for the difference. Nor, interestingly, does the spectacular acceleration of inequality between the richest and the rest.They suggest a similar explanation for both results: If a poor child perceives the middle class as out of reach, prohibitively far from his or her own station, the child will have little incentive to make the investments needed to get there, like finishing high school or avoiding becoming pregnant. This they call \u201ceconomic despair.\u201d\u201cThere are different ways to think about perceptions,\u201d Professor Kearney says. \u201cMaybe they are discouraged. Maybe it\u2019s an identity story: \u2018I\u2019m not one of these people.\u2019 Their peer group norms are different.\u201dThe work of Professors Levine and Kearney provides valuable new insight into inequality\u2019s impact on American society. It helps reconcile the fact that high school graduation rates among the poor have been stuck for decades even as the wage gap between graduates and dropouts has steadily widened, which should have provided an extra incentive to complete school.Importantly, their model of \u201ceconomic despair\u201d provides a decisive blow to the nation\u2019s mythical identity as the land of opportunity: for many children at the bottom, it suggests, opportunity is not just out of reach. It is inconceivable.The research by Professors Kearney and Levine could portend a bleak future in which the diminished expectations of young Americans in disadvantaged families lead to poor choices that deepen their disadvantage as adults, and lead them to produce children with even lower expectations than their own.As Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University, told me: \u201cThe decisions that you make in your teens are going to determine in some sense how the rest of your life is going to be.\u201dBut it is not hopeless. \u201cThe kinds of interventions we need are those that shape the opportunity sets and the perception of opportunity of these kids,\u201d Ms. Kearney said.Among the boys in the Becoming a Man program at Harper High, that does not seem to be an insurmountable task. Mr. Jackson started a recent session with a little tale:He recounted how he was rear-ended by three drunken, angry men while sitting in his car at a stoplight just a few nights before. Should he confront them? Argue? He crossed the street and called the cops. He offered the students in the circle the method with which he figured out the answer: He should remember his stake in the future.Among the boys I talked to, one hopes to be a commercial artist, another a music producer, another a police officer, another a game designer. They might not all succeed. But with Mr. Jackson\u2019s help, they all seemed to have developed a sense about how they might get there. Following that path increases the odds that they will avoid the really bad stuff.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

In 2012, Virgin America began offering nonstop flights from Kennedy Airport to the two-runway Wexler-designed Palm Springs International Airport.\u201cEvery few years, there\u2019s a magazine article: \u2018Palm Springs is back\u2019; \u2018It\u2019s hot again,\u2019 ha, ha,\u201d said Brad Dunning, an interior designer who began visiting the resort from Los Angeles in the early 1990s and moved there full time last year. \u201cBut now it actually feels like it is.\u201dIf Mr. DiCaprio\u2019s move has many locals reading the runes, it\u2019s probably because movie actors and moguls put Palm Springs on the map in the first place. In the late 1920s and early \u201930s, resorts like El Mirador and the Racquet Club catered to Hollywood players attracted to the sublime weather and studio-handy seclusion. Cary Grant, Jack Warner and Darryl Zanuck were among those who built Spanish-style estates in neighborhoods like Las Palmas and the Movie Colony. After World War II, the pioneering modernist architects drawn to the area created sexy glass-walled residences for clients such as Ms. Shore, Frank Sinatra and Kirk Douglas.But in the \u201990s, the area enjoyed a boomlet of interest as creative directors, advertising photographers and interior designers discovered its space-age relics. \u201cThis was a very specific sector who appreciated the architecture and design,\u201d said Catherine Meyler, a Los Angeles location scout who bought Richard Neutra\u2019s glass-and-steel Miller house in 2000 and has been restoring it ever since. \u201cNow the group has widened.\u201dFor years, the city\u2019s demographics have skewed \u201cgay and gray,\u201d but the community is diversifying. \u201cCoachella changed everything,\u201d said Keith Markovitz, a young real estate broker with TTK Represents/Christie\u2019s International. \u201cThey\u2019re coming out for the music, but guess where they\u2019re partying?\u201dFor the last five years, a good number of the bearded and tattooed have been partying at the Ace Hotel and Swim Club, a former Howard Johnson motel that seems to thrive inside a pair of giant, invisible quotation marks. There is a diner with rock walls and brown leather booths, a cavelike dive bar and a decorative trailer out by the pool. On a recent evening, a D.J. spun electro-lounge anthems outside, where a party of glassy-eyed 20-somethings kicked off a treasure hunt (sample checklist item: \u201cAnyone who knew Frank Sinatra or Bob Hope\u201d).The options for visitors are also growing. Josie and Doug Smith recently opened Sparrows Hotel, a 20-room complex at the south end of town that looks like a Western set and functions like a Zen retreat. Just down the street from Sparrows, the two-year-old Saguaro, a former Holiday Inn done over in a psychedelic color scheme inspired by desert flowers, wraps around a pool that is reputed to be the largest in Palm Springs and that, during the Dinah Pool Party II, was thronged with female guests sipping tropical drinks. Another south-end resort, the elegant William Cody-conceived Horizon, is being renovated by the designer Steve Hermann. And in the Uptown Design District, ground was recently broken for Arrive, a high-tech boutique hotel (guest rooms will open at the tap of a smartphone) bankrolled by Ezra Callahan, who made his riches as an early Facebook employee.Sprouting up around the north end of Palm Canyon Drive, the Uptown Design District has matured into a sleek shopping zone with scarcely a T-shirt shop or frozen yogurt chain in sight. Home to some of the city\u2019s best midcentury design stores (Modern Way, Flow Modern Design, A La Mod) and art galleries (Archangel Gallery, Jorge Mendez Gallery and Yares Art Projects, which is opening in October), it now has a number of equally worthy restaurants. The brunch crowd dons its most eye-popping Trina Turk and Wil Stiles and lines up outside Cheeky\u2019s for the restaurant\u2019s fresh-pressed juices and bacon bar. Workshop Kitchen & Bar offers locally sourced New American fare in a monastic, vaulted-ceilinged space inside the historic El Paseo complex. And in the inky depths of Bar, bands and D.J.s play for the beer-cocktail set.Bar also hosts \u201cArt Bar,\u201d a well-attended happy hour (or three) introducing underexposed local artists. \u201cWe\u2019re finally getting the young creative class in Palm Springs,\u201d said the event\u2019s organizer, Eric Nash, a painter who moved to the desert from Los Angeles four years ago. \u201cI wanted to provide a forum for fashion and art and music people to connect and cross-pollinate.\u201dA new shopping center going up in the middle of town, a slick mall anchored by a six-story Kimpton Hotel, represents a missed opportunity to residents who would prefer that the city support the \u201cadaptive reuse\u201d of historic buildings if it can\u2019t get behind more dynamic projects. \u201cDevelopers are working hard to demolish things that could add to the charm of the town, like the Town & Country Center,\u201d said Ms. Meyler, referring to a retail complex that was designed in the International Style by Paul Williams and A. Quincy Jones in 1948 and is threatened with destruction.More eagerly awaited, perhaps, is the architect and developer Chris Pardo\u2019s Hacienda Cantina and Beach Club, a sprawling day club and nightspot set to open in south Palm Springs at the end of the year. (Galas and benefit parties may take place every weekend during \u201cthe season\u201d here \u2014 October to May \u2014 but the city has long lacked a major social hub.) \u201cI think the Hacienda might be like what the Racquet Club used to be,\u201d said Stephen Collins, a style pundit from Britain who hosted a web series for Modernism Week. \u201cMaybe not sitting in a clubhouse in flannel trousers, but a kind of be-there experience.\u201dBut even Mr. Collins, who believes Mr. DiCaprio has \u201cmade it permissible to be an A-list movie star in Palm Springs again,\u201d suggested that the city\u2019s rebirth might best be a quiet one. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s always going to be a lovely place to just come and chill out by your pool,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I do think one of the charming things about Palm Springs is that it really doesn\u2019t matter what type of flip-flops you\u2019re wearing. In the Hamptons I suppose they\u2019d have to be Marc Jacobs.\u201d slide showAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Climate Domino", "Date": "2014-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor what it\u2019s worth, however, the attacks on the new rules mainly involve the three C\u2019s: conspiracy, cost and China. That is, right-wingers claim that there isn\u2019t any global warming, that it\u2019s all a hoax promulgated by thousands of scientists around the world; that taking action to limit greenhouse gas emissions would devastate the economy; and that, anyway, U.S. policy can\u2019t accomplish anything because China will just go on spewing stuff into the atmosphere.I don\u2019t want to say much about the conspiracy theorizing, except to point out that any attempt to make sense of current American politics must take into account this particular indicator of the Republican Party\u2019s descent into madness. There is, however, a lot to say about both the cost and China issues.On cost: It\u2019s reasonable to argue that new rules aimed at limiting emissions would have some negative effect on G.D.P. and family incomes. Even that isn\u2019t necessarily true, especially in a depressed economy, where regulations that require new investment could end up creating jobs. Still, the odds are that the E.P.A.\u2019s action, if it goes into effect, will hurt at least a little.Claims that the effects will be devastating are, however, not just wrong but inconsistent with what conservatives claim to believe. Ask right-wingers how the U.S. economy will cope with limited supplies of raw materials, land, and other resources, and they respond with great optimism: the magic of the marketplace will lead us to solutions. But they abruptly lose their faith in market magic when someone proposes limits on pollution \u2014 limits that would largely be imposed in market-friendly ways like cap-and-trade systems. Suddenly, they insist that businesses will be unable to adjust, that there are no alternatives to doing everything energy-related exactly the way we do it now.That, however, is precisely why we need the new policy. America can\u2019t expect other countries to take strong action against emissions while refusing to do anything itself, so the new rules are needed to get the game going. And it\u2019s fairly certain that action in the U.S. would lead to corresponding action in Europe and Japan.That leaves China, and there have been many cynical declarations over the past few days to the effect that China will just go ahead and burn any coal that we don\u2019t. And we certainly don\u2019t want to count on Chinese altruism.But we don\u2019t have to. China is enormously dependent on access to advanced-country markets \u2014 a lot of the coal it burns can be attributed, directly or indirectly, to its export business \u2014 and it knows that it would put this access at risk if it refused to play any role in protecting the planet.The new carbon policy, then, is supposed to be the beginning, not the end, a domino that, once pushed over, should start a chain reaction that leads, finally, to global steps to limit climate change. Do we know that it will work? Of course not. But it\u2019s vital that we try. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Nation\u2019s Economy, This Side of the Recession", "Date": "2014-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementAfter a long climb from the valley, the number of jobs has finally reached the previous peak of January 2008, with gains of more than 8.5 million jobs since early 2010. Still, the working-age population has grown substantially in the last six years, and the nation's economy, by reliable estimates, is at least seven million jobs below its potential. That has cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars in lost output.With the weak recovery from the recession, more than four million people are still considered among the long-term unemployed, out of work for at least half a year. They face considerably dimmer prospects of finding another job as their skills deteriorate and their contact with the world of work fades.And that does not count the more than six million who have opted out of the labor force altogether, even taking into account demographic factors like the aging of the population.Economists hope that many such people will be lured back to work as business improves and that wages will rise as the labor market tightens. But for now, the slack in the economy has served to hold down pay; wages for roughly four-fifths of American workers have declined since 2007, after adjusting for inflation.Unemployment rateBEFORENOW5.0%6.3%Recession\u201900\u201907\u201914Labor force participation rateBEFORENOW66.0%62.8%\u201900\u201907\u201914Share of unemployed out ofwork for six months or moreBEFORENOW17.4%34.4%\u201900\u201907\u201914Source: Bureau of Labor StatisticsThe downturn hit hard at industries that employ middle-wage workers, particularly those categories with large concentrations of men, and the subsequent recovery has done little to improve their position. More than 1.5 million construction jobs, paying wages of $55,120, on average, are still missing.The manufacturing sector, which pays an average of $51,480 a year, has regained several hundred thousand jobs in the last couple of years but now employs 1.7 million fewer workers than it did before the recession.By contrast, the health care sector has continued to thrive, expanding its role as a leading employer at all salary levels and emerging as the backbone of an evolving new middle class. Home services and outpatient centers grew the most, as the American population aged and health services shifted away from hospitals to less expensive ways of delivering care. And while the growth has slowed under pressure to keep costs down, health care services have added 1.5 million jobs and are expected to expand further.Over all, industries whose average salaries are in the middle of the  wage spectrum have shrunk by 2.5 million jobs.Industries paying middle wages3 million1 million500,000 jobsKEYHeath careindustries\u00a0Constructionindustries\u00a0Manufacturingindustries\u00a0+60%+40%+20%GROWNSHRUNK\u201320%\u201340%$17$26$35AVG.

But the most recent downturn was one of the worst, leaving the American economy with only about 12 million people working for manufacturing industries, 8.7 percent of the total number on payrolls.By contrast, after a steep two-year drop that began in 2008, the total value of what the country makes is now back to where it was in 2007. As a result, companies doing business in the United States are producing their cars, airplanes, computer chips, turbines, household appliances and most everything else at fewer factories with many fewer workers.That efficiency and high productivity provide many benefits. But because manufacturing jobs tend to pay better than those at retailers and restaurants \u2014 two sectors that have led the job expansion after the recession \u2014 the loss of so many factory positions is an important reason for the erosion of middle-wage jobs.Manufacturing has recaptured a bit of momentum recently, with lower energy prices, a recovering auto industry and the return of some overseas production lifting employment by 600,000 from the trough four years ago.While there will be bumps along the road, American industry will probably continue on the path of greater production of more valuable and sophisticated goods, relying on a shrinking share of the total work force.Manufacturing production indexBEFORENOW100.2101.0\u201990\u201900\u201907\u201914Manufacturing employmentIn millionsBEFORENOW13.712.1\u201990\u201900\u201907\u201914Sources: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis;Bureau of Labor StatisticsWhile the richest Americans have generally recouped their losses from the recession and gained considerable new wealth during the recovery, the situation is bleaker for the poor and for low-wage workers than it was in 2007.As work dried up and wages stagnated, tens of millions of Americans took jobs with lower pay and fewer hours, many of them turning to the federal government for additional support to help make ends meet.The number of people receiving food stamps under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program soared to 47.6 million in 2013 from 26.3 million in 2007. Incomes for the typical middle-income family have slipped, and the nation\u2019s poverty rate remains above its prerecession level.Food stamp recipientsBEFORENOW26.347.6In millions\u201913\u201990\u201900\u201907Poverty rateBEFORENOW12.5%15.0%\u201990\u201900\u201912Median household incomeBEFORENOW$55,627 $51,017\u201990\u201900\u201912Sources: U.S. Department of Agriculture;U.S. Census BureauThe collapse of the mortgage-fueled housing bubble was the central cause of the recession. Although housing\u2019s revival over the last couple of years has helped stabilize the economy, the sector will probably never again contribute as much to economic activity as it did during the boom years of the early 2000s.Moreover, after scraping along the bottom for so long, it\u2019s not clear what a normal housing industry would look like. Prices have rebounded, builders are breaking ground on new developments, foreclosures have dwindled and households are forming once more. But almost one in five homeowners with mortgages owe more than their homes are worth.Even after double-digit price increases, houses are still about 15 percent below their peak value, on average. The situation varies widely across the country, however, with energy-rich states like Texas and North Dakota surpassing their old peaks while those that were hit hardest, like Nevada and Florida, still far from their previous highs.Change from pre-recession peak home pricesTwo years agoOne year agoNowPEAKPEAKPEAK\u201360%\u201340%\u201320%\u201360%\u201340%\u201320%\u201360%\u201340%\u201320%Nev.N.C.U.S.Vt.Fla.Wis.Ark.Ariz.Va.Tenn.R.I.Mass.HawaiiW.Va.Mo.N.Y.Ill.Ga.Mont.Mich.UtahIowaN.J.OhioNeb.Conn.Wash.AlaskaMd.Ore.La.N.M.Miss.Okla.Pa.IdahoColo.Ind.Del.Tex.Kan.N.H.Wyo.Calif.S.C.S.D.Ala.Ky.N.D.Minn.Me.Source: CoreLogic Home Price Index, single-family combined series, as of April 2014Change from pre-recession peak home pricesTwo years agoOne year agoNowPEAK\u201360%\u201340%\u201320%Nev.Fla.Ariz.R.I.W.Va.Ill.Mich.N.J.Conn.Md.N.M.IdahoDel.N.H.Calif.Ala.Minn.U.S.Wis.Va.Mass.Mo.Ga.UtahOhioWash.Ore.Miss.Pa.Ind.Kan.S.C.Ky.Me.N.C.Vt.Ark.Tenn.HawaiiN.Y.Mont.IowaNeb.AlaskaLa.Okla.Colo.Tex.Wyo.S.D.N.D.Source: CoreLogic Home Price Index,single-family combined series, as of April 2014Change from pre-recession peak home pricesTwo years agoOne year agoNowPEAKPEAKPEAK\u201360%\u201340%\u201320%\u201360%\u201340%\u201320%\u201360%\u201340%\u201320%Nev.N.C.U.S.Vt.Fla.Wis.Ark.Ariz.Va.Tenn.R.I.Mass.HawaiiW.Va.Mo.N.Y.Ill.Ga.Mont.Mich.UtahIowaN.J.OhioNeb.Conn.Wash.AlaskaMd.Ore.La.N.M.Miss.Okla.Pa.IdahoColo.Ind.Del.Tex.Kan.N.H.Wyo.Calif.S.C.S.D.Ala.Ky.N.D.Minn.Me.Source: CoreLogic Home Price Index, single-family combined series, as of April 2014The middle of the country has been the prime beneficiary. Bolstered by hydraulic fracturing and other unconventional drilling methods, oil and natural gas output has surged, enriching traditional energy states like Texas as well as newer ones like North Dakota. (The effect can be seen in the map below, showing the change in all private employment by county.) Alternative energy sources like wind and solar have also gained.Since 2007, employment in the oil and gas drilling business has surged by 60,000, to nearly 210,000, the highest level since \u201cDallas\u201d was a hot television show in the 1980s and J.R.

Today, it is thriving.Social networking companies like Twitter and Facebook were just getting up and running in the years before the recession. Apple introduced its iPhone less than a year before the official start of the economic downturn in December 2007, setting off a wave of purchases of smartphones that have since come to dominate the market for mobile phones.These technology companies, along with hundreds of others, generally managed to power through the hard times and have since emerged as prime drivers of the economy, creating tremendous wealth for a number of individuals and adding many well-paying jobs.Silicon Valley, with its initial public offerings and billion-dollar acquisitions, isn\u2019t showing any signs of slowing down. And those high-tech companies that capitalize on social media, cloud computing and big data are so appealing that they have even been luring business school graduates away from high-paying Wall Street jobs.U.S. smartphone shipments136.6In millions20.1\u201907\u201913Industries of employmentamong U.S. M.B.A. graduates25%Products and services20%Finance and accounting Consulting 15%Technology 10%Nonprofits/governmentManufacturing Health care 5%Energy and utilities0%20082013Sources: International Data Corporation;GMAC Alumni Perspective SurveysNot all industries recovered equally over the past five years.

{"Headline": "Starting Out Behind", "Date": "2014-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialToday\u2019s young people, ages 18 to 24, should have been the lucky ones. They were preteens or teenagers when the recession hit in late 2007, with high school and college still ahead. Unlike those who had to enter the work force in the depths of the downturn, they had time, or so it seemed, to wait out the weak economy. But that\u2019s not how things have worked out. While the worst is over, economic conditions are still subpar, damaging the immediate job prospects and long-term living standards of young adults starting out now. In recent years, the economy has grown annually at 2 percent or so. That\u2019s too slow to make up the current shortfall of nearly seven million jobs, let alone to absorb new graduates or push up wages in jobs that do exist. For young people, these conditions will only deepen a long trend of increasing economic hardship. Census data that compares today\u2019s 18-to-24-year-olds with the same age group in 1970 and in 1990 show more poverty among young adults over time, as well as lower income and less independence. But young people today are appreciably worse off than those in previous generations. In 1970, for example, 13.9 percent of people ages 18 to 24 were in poverty. In 1990, 15.9 percent were poor; in 2012, the last year of available data, 20.4 percent were poor, or 6.1 million people. That data excludes students living in dorms, as well as most students who live with their parents or receive cash support from them. For young people who are on their own, either living alone or with housemates or spouses, median household income, recently $30,604, is nearly $4,600 less than in 1970 and virtually unchanged since 1990, adjusted for inflation. Lack of opportunity and lack of resources mean a smaller share of young high school and college graduates are relocating, traditionally a way up a career ladder. In 1970, nearly 40 percent of young people had moved in the prior year; in 1990, it was nearly 32 percent; in 2013, it was only 21.6 percent. Not surprisingly, the share of young adults living with their parents is 55.3 percent, compared with 47.3 percent in 1970 and 52.8 percent in 1990. Young people are clearly banking on a college education to improve their prospects \u2014 41 percent of 18-to-24-year-olds were recently enrolled in college, a higher share than in previous generations. But the unemployment rate of college graduates ages 21 to 24 remains high at an average of 8.5 percent over the past year. Underemployment \u2014 which includes those who are officially unemployed, those who want to work but haven\u2019t looked recently for a job and those stuck in part-time jobs \u2014 is 16.8 percent. Over the last six years, one of the economy\u2019s biggest problems has been faulty fiscal policy, with the federal government underestimating the need for economic aid or withholding and reducing help prematurely. Another drag has been lack of business investment, even as financial markets have prospered with the help of loose monetary policy.The result has been an economy where young people starting out are at risk of prolonged underachievement. It is possible to defuse that risk, but not without responsive policy and robust investment. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Debates Who Put Out the Lights in Mosquito Bay", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIEQUES, P.R. \u2014 Sitting on a small boat in Mosquito Bay, a tapestry of stars above him, Mark Martin, a field researcher, scooped water into a canister. He studied the liquid for some sign of why, suddenly and inexplicably, one of the world\u2019s most famous bioluminescent bays had dimmed.\u201cIt\u2019s all good tonight,\u201d Mr. Martin said, about the water\u2019s clarity, pH level, temperature and salinity \u2014 several factors that scientists hope may solve the puzzle of what ails the bay.For as long as people can remember, the bay on the southern end of this islet, 10 miles away from Puerto Rico\u2019s main island, has astonished first-timers who thrill to see the water radiate like a glow stick at night. But in January, the shimmering microscopic plankton known as dinoflagellates called off their show altogether. In recent weeks, they have brightened somewhat again, sporadically and halfheartedly, raising hopes that the popular bay may be regenerating.The abrupt blackout has alarmed government officials, scientists and Viequenses, the islanders who depend on tourism to fuel their lackluster economy; one tour operator has already shut down. The bay has gone dark before, but never for more than several days. For now, visits to the bay are limited to weekends until the bay heals itself.Most worrisome is that the dimming of the bay is a whodunit \u2014 a mystery that has stoked animus between locals and the business owners, nearly all of whom are originally from the mainland United States, who run tourist trips to the bay. Because bioluminescent bays are seldom studied over long periods, nobody knows what has prompted the dinoflagellates to either leave the bay or diminish their magical bluish-green glow.And nobody knows if and when the bay\u2019s shimmer will come back to full strength. Some bioluminescent bays in the Caribbean and beyond, including Laguna Grande in Fajardo, P.R., have gone dark temporarily and then resumed full strength (sometimes big storms are to blame for the blackouts). Others come back with more erratic glows. A few have turned off altogether.Saving Mosquito Bay is critical, scientists and government officials said. Only a handful of prized bioluminescent bays exist in the Caribbean, and a few more lie in the Pacific. Their numbers fluctuate as some die out and others take their place, and many only offer a seasonal glow. For the dinoflagellate to thrive, conditions must be just right. Mosquito Bay is optimal: warm and shallow with stable winds and ringed by red mangroves, which feed the plankton.\u201cThey are a very rare and a unique ecosystem, and without proactive management, they just won\u2019t stick around,\u201d said Michael Latz, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied bioluminescent bays since 2010. \u201cThe question is how resilient are the dinoflagellates and does bioluminescence come back. You cross your fingers and hope it will.\u201dFor now, natural causes, including a wind shift, rank high among prevailing theories. But other culprits are also being studied, among them sediment from the long rutted dirt road that leads vehicles to the bay and the effects of too many people kayaking in the bay.In Puerto Rico, government officials are scrambling to preserve the bay\u2019s glow for environmental and economic reasons. Mosquito Bay is the most popular and lucrative tourist attraction in Vieques, an impoverished island of 9,000 residents with few businesses but an abundance of crystalline beaches.Concerned by the prospect of a long-term blackout, Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of Natural Resources has formed a task force to study and monitor the bay. And for the first time, it has curtailed use of the bay.Until at least the end of June, and perhaps beyond, only licensed operators can bring kayakers to the bay, and only Friday through Sunday. This will give the bay breathing room and allow scientists to study it undisturbed, government officials said.Other strict measures are also being put in place. Park rangers are now counting the number of people who visit the small bay and are keeping a close watch of it at night to ensure that rules \u2014 for example, no swimming, as of several years ago \u2014 are being followed. And the government is improving the dirt road.\u201cWe know the bay is not behaving consistently, and for that we need to study and investigate,\u201d said Carmen Guerrero P\u00e9rez, secretary of the Department of Natural Resources.While no conclusions have yet been drawn, Dr. Latz said one reason for the loss of bioluminescence may be a shift in wind direction to the north last winter. Strong winds from that direction would push the dinoflagellates (which cannot swim against the current) out of the bay\u2019s narrow mouth back into the Caribbean Sea. These strong winds in January and March also made the bay extremely turbid, which interferes with bioluminescence.Ms. Guerrero said she was skeptical that the daily visitors, numbering in the hundreds, were the cause. \u201cWe would have seen it before if it were directly tied to that,\u201d she said.On this island, which for 50 years was home to a highly contentious Navy bombing range, the finger-pointing over the dimming of the bay has also become a proxy battle between business owners and locals, who are historically wary of outside involvement here.Carlos Prieto, a lifelong fisherman who studied biology, said he blamed an increase in the number of government permits to tour operators and the lack of oversight for the dimming. Viequenses, he said, are also upset because they can only visit the bay now if they pay a tour operator.\u201cAll of this increases turbidity and brings changes to the bay, but they continue to give them permission for tourists to come,\u201d he said. \u201cThese decisions are all made from far away.\u201dBusiness owners said they, too, were caretakers of the bay, and they expressed frustration at the lack of answers and the blame shifting. Business has suffered greatly since the dimming and the moratorium, said Bryan Jahnke, the owner of Black Beard Sports, which is allowed to take 20 kayakers a day out to the bay.\u201cIt\u2019s become an us-versus-them issue,\u201d he said. \u201cAction or inaction, we are stuck in the middle of this. But the mandate should be that we find out what the problem is to prevent it from happening in the future.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the bioluminescent bays in Vieques, P.R., referred imprecisely to the business owners that are at odds with island residents. While all of the business owners and locals are American, most of the business owners are originally from the mainland United States, not from Puerto Rico. In addition, the article misstated the length of time that the marine biologist Michael Latz has studied bioluminescent bays. He has done so since 2010, not for three decades, though he has been studying bioluminescence for 30 years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "South Africa\u2019s World Cup Illusions", "Date": "2014-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the soccer off-season in South Africa these days. Cape Town\u2019s huge Green Point Stadium \u2014 purpose-built for the 2010 FIFA World Cup \u2014 sits dormant, an imposing but vacant sentry blotting the sweeping ocean views once enjoyed by the area\u2019s wealthy residents. The $600 million, 55,000-seat behemoth was, for the past three seasons, home turf for Ajax Cape Town, the city\u2019s only representative in South Africa\u2019s premier soccer league. But that status hasn\u2019t earned the club any freebies. The City of Cape Town, which owns the stadium, allowed Ajax to use the stadium under a fixed-term rental contract that expires this year, returning the club for the moment to its training ground and spiritual home 12 miles away, in the working-class suburb of Parow.South Africa\u2019s experience four years after hosting a successful World Cup is a cautionary tale for Brazil, which has also spent heavily on building brand-new stadiums, often in remote areas, that may rarely be used again.Before 2010, many people, including some government officials, wanted to upgrade a stadium in Athlone, a working-class neighborhood of mostly \u201ccolored,\u201d or mixed-race, residents. They believed the investments in transport, security and economic infrastructure that would come from hosting World Cup matches in Athlone would reduce inequality.But international soccer\u2019s governing body was appalled that the South African government might consider subjecting World Cup revelers to Athlone\u2019s low-cost housing and other signs of poverty. Under FIFA\u2019s strict instructions, local authorities capitulated and a new stadium was built in Green Point. That stadium stands today, a hollow nod to the South African government\u2019s hope that hosting the World Cup would create public spaces where people would gather to transgress the apartheid-era boundaries that still divide them.Cape Town\u2019s stadium symbolizes the worst of FIFA\u2019s legacy in South Africa. It is a superfluous megastructure unwanted by the wealthier, mostly white residents nearby, and it is far away from the areas where soccer fans, who are mostly black and colored, live. The stadium has also become a strain on the public purse, costing the city at least $32 million since 2010. These funds could be better spent on the city\u2019s more urgent priorities, such as providing sanitation and houses for the poor. The lack of such services continues to be the spark that periodically ignites protests.The city government says it wants the stadium to become a mixed-use venue, with a few long-term tenants to keep the crowds and revenue coming in during lean times when concerts and festivals are in short supply. However, except for Ajax, no other long-term tenants have been secured. And Cape Town\u2019s major rugby teams appear wedded to their historical home in Newlands, another well-to-do suburb.Cape Town is not alone in this predicament. Other World Cup stadiums, particularly the ones built for the event, and the cities in which they are located, are experiencing similar difficulties in turning the venues into self-sustaining public spaces that serve some social good.The fact that genuine public discussions about who should foot the bill and whether the costs were reasonable is happening belatedly is a testament to how successful FIFA is at using the near-universal love for soccer and the World Cup to draw people and their governments into agreements in which the fine print reads that FIFA pockets the profits and the host nations pick up the cost.And now the same thing is happening in Brazil. For their part, Brazilians have responded to FIFA\u2019s poisoned chalice in a more organized fashion than South Africans ever managed before, during or after the event. After seeing how the FIFA World Cup sausage is made, you might think that the protests in Brazil would make uncomfortable viewing for us in South Africa, but you\u2019d be wrong. For some South Africans it\u2019s about pragmatism. Take Ajax, for example. The club is happy to move to Green Point stadium because it allows them to offer fans more than soccer; it can offer safer facilities within walking distance of nightlife, restaurants and other forms of entertainment that are absent in the suburbs, where the majority of the club\u2019s fan base lives. They can also raise ticket prices and potentially attract richer fans. But for the most part, the memory of hosting an outwardly perfect global event still evokes a hallowed glow of national pride, even though, inwardly, the event failed to deliver the promised boost to our economy.South Africans showed in 2010, and are showing again now by remaining glued to our screens in wonderment, that we are willing to hold whatever discontent we may feel about FIFA and the World Cup\u2019s legacy in abeyance for the love of the game and for national pride. One can only hope that \u2014 win or lose \u2014 the Brazilians will be tougher and demand more of their leaders. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lew Unveils Small Steps to Augment Loan Modification Program", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Obama administration will take further steps to ease foreclosures, rising rents and scarce mortgages, Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said on Thursday at a conference observing the fifth anniversary of Making Home Affordable, a suite of federal programs aimed at helping homeowners after the financial crisis.Of the $46 billion in federal bailout money reserved for homeowners after the crisis, about $38 billion has been obligated but only $12.4 billion has been paid out.The administration has defended its cornerstone program, a loan modification program known as HAMP, which has resulted in more than 1.3 million loan restructurings.The program helped far fewer people than anticipated, but officials say that it pushed lenders to behave better in general.\u201cAs we know, our initiatives have not been a silver bullet,\u201d Mr. Lew said. \u201cBut HAMP and our other programs cannot be judged only on what they have done directly for homeowners. Treasury\u2019s housing assistance programs have become a model for the broader housing sector.\u201dThe new measures announced by Mr. Lew were incremental.Housing advocates applauded the extension, mainly because there is nothing yet to replace it.Despite a host of new regulations governing mortgage lending, neither regulators nor the industry has come up with a model for loan modifications, advocates said. While the industry may have used HAMP as a model, borrowers with HAMP modifications do better than those with less generous bank-governed modifications.\u201cWe hope policy makers will also use this opportunity to ensure that sustainable modifications are a permanent part of the mortgage landscape, and not just a stopgap measure during a time of crisis,\u201d said Alys Cohen, a housing expert at the National Consumer Law Center.For tenants, the help announced Thursday was less direct, coming in the form of subsidized loans to apartment builders for affordable housing. New loans would come from the Federal Financing Bank, which is under Treasury\u2019s direction. The program could more than double the volume of multifamily loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration each year, officials said. The first project to be financed under the new plan will be an affordable rental building in the Rockaways, Queens, that was damaged by Hurricane Sandy.Mr. Lew said the new financing was a result of President Obama\u2019s instructions that the administration should do as much as it could in the absence of action from Congress.Still, Mr. Lew urged Congress to extend the Mortgage Debt Relief Act, so that homeowners who conduct short sales in lieu of foreclosure do not face a hefty tax bill, and to reform the nation\u2019s housing finance system, now dominated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He said nothing about principal reduction, which has been banned by Fannie and Freddie on the mortgages they back, and which a growing body of evidence suggests is the most effective way to help homeowners and the broader economy.The Treasury had promised that Mr. Lew would address the expansion of credit to potential home buyers, millions of whom are unable to get a mortgage with today\u2019s tight standards. No new programs were offered, though Mr. Lew said the Treasury was working to jump-start the all-but-vanished market for private mortgage-backed securities, which would help lenders grow more confident and make more loans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Battle Over Fracking Poses Threat to Colorado Democrats", "Date": "2014-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 An impassioned national debate over the oil-production technique known as fracking is edging toward the ballot box in Colorado, opening an election-year rift between moderate, energy-friendly Democrats and environmentalists who want to rein in drilling or give local communities the power to outlaw it altogether.If they make the ballot in November, an array of proposals will be among the first in the nation to ask a state\u2019s voters to sharply limit energy development. Some measures would keep drilling as far as a half-mile from Colorado homes. Others would give individual communities the right to ban fracking.The ballot measures reflect the anxieties that have accompanied a drilling boom across the West. As drilling sites are built closer to playgrounds and suburban homes in communities along Colorado\u2019s northern plains, residents and environmental groups have called for more regulation and have pushed for moratoriums on drilling. But in a bellwether state like Colorado, where views on drilling vary as much as the geography, the measures could ignite an all-out battle involving oil companies, business groups and conservationists that pulls in millions in outside money, sets off a rush of campaign ads and spawns lawsuits for years to come. That is why Gov. John W. Hickenlooper and other Democratic leaders are working feverishly on a compromise that would give communities more control of energy development in their backyards while keeping the fracking issue off the ballot.Political strategists say that an election-year fracking fight has the potential to hurt vulnerable Democrats, forcing them to take a stance that could either anger environmental voters or draw fire from the oil and gas industry.\u201cThis is a fight within the Democratic Party,\u201d said Floyd Ciruli, an independent political analyst in Denver. For prominent Democrats, he said, \u201cthis is dangerous. It might turn off environmental forces. It will create a tremendous amount of noise between the Democratic establishment and its rank and file.\u201dLate last week, Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s office announced it had reached a compromise with two major oil-and-gas companies and Representative Jared Polis, a millionaire Democrat who has been a strong supporter of the ballot measures.For now, it is uncertain whether Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s deal will become a reality. For weeks, Representative Cory Gardner, a Republican, has criticized the Democratic incumbent, Mark Udall, for not disavowing the proposed ballot measures, saying they would kill jobs and cripple an energy boom that has financed schools and aided local economies.Despite his support for renewable energy, Mr. Udall has said he believes that fracking \u2014 the underground injection of millions of gallons of water and sand to release oil and gas in the earth \u2014 can be done safely. But he has avoided taking a position on the proposed ballot measures. A spokesman said that Mr. Udall hoped the two sides could reach some legislative deal that would avoid a ballot fight.The politics of fracking have yet to be tested across a state that cherishes its mountain streams and aspen forests, but where the oil and gas industry claims to support more than 50,000 jobs and $29.6 billion in economic activity. Putting fracking to a vote, Mr. Hickenlooper said, would unleash an \u201carmed conflict\u201d on the airwaves and could result in \u201ceconomic chaos\u201d for the energy industry and even the state as a whole. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a surgery, and all you\u2019ve got is a pair of scissors and a hacksaw,\u201d Mr. Hickenlooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blunt response to what\u2019s a complex issue.\u201dAs a former oil geologist who supports energy development in Colorado \u2014 he once drank fracking fluid \u2014 Mr. Hickenlooper has long had a touchy relationship with some environmental advocates. He passed strict rules on gas leaks from well sites and storage tanks, but he has also been publicly heckled by those who oppose fracking.He said he was trying to find some thin strip of common ground between environmentalists and homeowners in Colorado\u2019s energy belt, and the companies that own the rights to stores of minerals buried thousands of feet underground.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to respect private property we\u2019re going to have to respect the rights of mineral leaseholders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have rights, too, and how do we balance their rights against the rights of people living in their homes?\u201dA draft of the proposed compromise would give local governments the power to regulate noise from oil and gas development and impose bigger setbacks from homes than the 500-foot buffers currently required. It would also let communities write their own, stricter health, safety and environmental standards. The local rules could not prevent energy companies from reaching the minerals underground.Across Colorado, leading Democrats hope to avoid finding out how the public\u2019s views translate at the ballot box. Senator Michael Bennet has been urging a compromise, and a litany of officials including former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, a former Denver mayor and a former Democratic governor have spoken out against a statewide fracking vote.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about putting something like this in the Constitution,\u201d a former Democratic governor, Bill Ritter, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to ever change. If it\u2019s a ban or a moratorium, you wind up doing great harm to your local economy. It\u2019s a lose-lose situation if it goes to the ballot.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The final reading of the HSBC index is scheduled for release Tuesday.\u201cThe upside surprise was led by the new-orders index, which rose to a six-month high, reflecting the government\u2019s continued effort since mid-March to boost investment and construction activities,\u201d Jian Chang and Serena Zhou, economists at Barclays, said in a note, referring to China\u2019s official index.A subindex for new orders, a measure of foreign and domestic demand, edged up to 52.3 in May from 51.2 in April, marking the highest level since November.Beijing has stepped up policy fine-tuning in recent weeks and has unveiled a series of measures this year to shore up the economy, which dipped to an 18-month low in the first quarter and which analysts expect to post its weakest annual showing in 24 years.China\u2019s cabinet, the State Council, announced new measures on Friday to help lower funding costs and reduce operating burdens for companies as a way to bolster the economy, much like previous efforts to hasten the construction of railways and public housing.Signals were mixed from other HSBC indexes for manufacturing in Asia, which like the China index are compiled by the research firm Markit.In South Korea, a manufacturing and export powerhouse, the gauge slid to a seasonally adjusted 49.5 in May from 50.2 in April. Trade data for May showed that the nation\u2019s exports fell 0.9 percent compared with the same month last year, below analysts\u2019 estimate for growth of 1.2 percent.

Entire states in the Southeast and the Corn Belt may lose much of their agriculture as farming shifts northward in a warming world. Heat and humidity will probably grow so intense that spending time outside will become physically dangerous, throwing industries like construction and tourism into turmoil.The former Treasury secretaries \u2014 including Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Republican who served under President George W. Bush, and Robert E. Rubin, a Democrat in the Clinton administration \u2014 promised to help sound the alarm. All endorse putting a price on greenhouse gases, most likely by taxing emissions.\u201cI actually do believe that we\u2019re at a tipping point with the planet,\u201d Mr. Paulson said in an interview at his home in Chicago. \u201cA lot of things are going to happen that none of us are going to like to see.\u201dSpeaking Tuesday morning at a news conference in New York, Mr. Rubin urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to take a tougher stance in requiring that publicly held companies disclose the climate-related risks they may face. While many companies have started issuing such warnings to investors, the disclosures are often vague and inadequate, he said.\u201cI have come to believe that climate change is the existential issue of our age,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cI believe that investors should insist that companies disclose their risks, including the value of assets that could be stranded.\u201dMr. Houser called the analysis \u201cthe most detailed modeling ever done on the impact of climate change on specific sectors of the U.S. economy.\u201dStill, it is unclear whether the new report, or the voices of the former Treasury secretaries, will have an effect on companies or investors, given that many decisions on Wall Street are driven by short-term considerations of profit and loss.The report said the economic effects would vary substantially by region. Some colder states may actually benefit from higher temperatures in significant ways, including longer growing seasons.Under the likeliest projections, Mr. Houser said, the American economy will keep growing throughout this century despite the increasing economic drag from climate change. So people in the future will probably be wealthier than those of today.But the warming will nonetheless impose huge costs, the report said. Coastal counties, home to 40 percent of the nation\u2019s population, will take especially large hits from the rise of the sea, which could swallow more than $370 billion worth of property in Florida and Louisiana alone by the end of the century.If greenhouse gas emissions continue at a rapid pace, the report said, the global sea level could increase roughly a foot by 2050, and double or triple that by century\u2019s end. A rise of as much as six or eight feet cannot be entirely ruled out, but that is more likely in the next century.Given that land is sinking in Louisiana even faster than the sea is rising, 4.1 percent to 5.5 percent of all insurable property in that state will be below mean sea level by 2050, the report predicted. By 2100, that figure could reach 15 percent to 20 percent. In Florida, 1 percent to 5 percent of all properties could fall below sea level by 2100, the report said.But long before homes and businesses along the coast are entirely inundated, the researchers said, owners will face escalating damages from flooding. That poses substantial risks to taxpayers, who subsidize the National Flood Insurance Program, which has already been put more than $20 billion in the red by storms of recent years. Coastal property owners have fought attempts by Congress to charge premiums reflecting the true hazard.The study projected complex effects on American agriculture. It is possible that farm output will continue rising, the report found, as it has done for many decades \u2014 but that increase may require huge shifts in where crops are grown.With current agricultural practices, the losses could be substantial in the Southeast and the Corn Belt, as high temperatures and water stress take a toll on crops. That would have to be made up by an agricultural shift to the northern rim of the country, with states like North Dakota and Minnesota potentially being net winners.But in parts of the country, farmers and other outdoor laborers will face routinely dangerous working conditions as summers grow longer and hotter, the report found.If emissions continue apace, the combination of heat and humidity projected for some regions, particularly the Southeast, at century\u2019s end means that anyone working outside at certain times will face a high risk of life-threatening heat stroke. And in the 22nd century, much of the eastern half of the country could face these conditions for weeks on end, the researchers predicted.While the economic consequences would probably be substantial, Mr. Houser\u2019s group essentially gave up on trying to attach hard numbers to that particular hazard.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be thinking about that risk in economic terms,\u201d Mr. Houser said. \u201cThat\u2019s just: What kind of world do we want to live in?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Battle Over European Commission Heats Up", "Date": "2014-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropePARIS \u2014 Observing the buildup to this week\u2019s European Union summit meeting, which is expected to nominate the next president of the European Commission and draw up a policy agenda for the next five years, is like watching a slow-motion train wreck.Two trains are rumbling toward each other \u2014 one driven by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, with most of the leaders of the union\u2019s member states aboard; the other is driven by the British prime minister, David Cameron, with his few passengers trying discreetly to jump off.Unless one of the locomotives veers onto another track at the last minute, they are headed for a collision \u2014 not over the policy agenda but over the choice of Jean-Claude Juncker, a veteran deal-broker for the union and a former prime minister of Luxembourg, for the bloc\u2019s most powerful job.Neither side shows any sign of changing course, but there is still an outside chance that someone may pull the emergency brake and postpone the showdown.A crash at the summit meeting \u2014 which opens symbolically in Ypres, Belgium, by commemorating the millions who died in the trenches of World War I nearly a century ago \u2014 would have lasting consequences for the future of European integration.Failure to derail Mr. Juncker could push Britain \u2014 the union\u2019s third-biggest economy after Germany and France, and, along with France, a key military and diplomatic power \u2014 closer to the bloc\u2019s exit door.Mr. Cameron has promised to negotiate far-reaching reforms of the union before giving British voters a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in 2017 if he is re-elected next year.The U.K. Independence Party, which is anti-European Union, as well as skeptics in Mr. Cameron\u2019s own Conservative Party, are bound to argue that if he cannot even block an \u201cold guard\u201d federalist like Mr. Juncker as commission chief, he stands no chance of clawing back significant powers from Brussels.Mr. Cameron\u2019s authority at home and abroad would be weakened, even if European leaders gave Britain consolation prizes on business-friendly policies and a key commission post, like the internal market portfolio.Appointing Mr. Juncker would be a victory for the European Parliament, which sought more power by having the main political groups put forward presidential candidates known as Spitzenkandidaten in last month\u2019s parliamentary elections.Mr. Cameron says European leaders should stand up for the principle that national governments are the prime source of democratic legitimacy in Europe, and not let Parliament usurp the power of nomination given them by the union\u2019s governing Lisbon Treaty.The treaty says only that national leaders should take into account the election result in choosing their nominee, who has to be approved by a majority in Parliament.But that train has already left the station. Mr. Cameron would have had to sign up allies a year ago who were known to have misgivings, like Ms. Merkel, before the Spitzenkandidaten system was created.In the end, Ms. Merkel and other national leaders went along with the choice of leading candidates by their own party families, attending the congresses that selected them. They cannot go back on their word to voters now without causing a storm at home, as Ms. Merkel did when she tried to assuage Mr. Cameron by edging away from Mr. Juncker two days after the vote.While the chancellor has stressed the importance she attaches to keeping Britain in the union, she is eager to limit the political damage and avoid a conflict between Europe\u2019s institutions that could fester for months.\u201cEvery time since the election that Merkel has tried to help Cameron, he went out the next day and lit an even bigger fire,\u201d an exasperated diplomat involved in summit preparations said.European Union diplomats sympathetic to London\u2019s constitutional arguments are perplexed by Mr. Cameron\u2019s tactics, such as a gloating tweet he sent when the opposition Labour Party backed his rejection of Mr. Juncker. \u201cHe has lost a lot of friends and good will by being so bullish,\u201d a longtime Brussels insider said. The Dutch and Swedish prime ministers have tiptoed away from the British camp, leaving Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, something of an authoritarian pariah in the union, as Mr. Cameron\u2019s only firm ally.If he is outvoted, as the union\u2019s governing treaty permits although European Council decisions are normally made by consensus, it will be \u201can index of Cameron\u2019s prestige and Britain\u2019s influence,\u201d the veteran diplomat said. The outcome may also tilt the balance of power among European institutions, giving Parliament more influence and the big member states somewhat less sway over the commission than they wielded executive in the past decade. Lawmakers would miss no opportunity to remind Mr. Juncker who made him king.Yet such a shift is unlikely to be dramatic because national governments hold most of the union\u2019s power and financial resources.Mr. Juncker, 59, a pillar of such summit meetings for a quarter-century and a crucial mediator between Germany and France on monetary union, knows better than anyone that Europe cannot be governed against the big member states.British officials brand him an old-style federalist. But as the former Belgian prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt \u2014 himself blackballed by Britain for the top job a decade ago \u2014 jokes, arguing that the commission\u2019s president should not be a federalist is like saying that the next pope should not be a Roman Catholic.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "India\u2019s Underground Economy", "Date": "2014-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From IndiaNEW DELHI \u2014 Generations of Indians have grown up imagining a bank with high ceilings and chandeliers in Switzerland, where shadowy Indians go to leave a lot of illicit cash in the care of practical white men. In popular lore, the \u201cSwiss bank account\u201d is an essential part of Indian villainy, even though illicit money is a common household possession.So, last week, when a news agency quoted a Swiss official as saying that Switzerland was willing to share with the Indian authorities information about Indians of dubious nature who hold bank accounts in that country, the Indian government appeared to give the news considerable importance. Considering the infamy of the Swiss bank account in the Indian imagination, data released last week by Switzerland\u2019s central bank, the Swiss National Bank, contained a surprise.Indians, not all of them shady, held about $2.3 billion in Swiss banks last year. That\u2019s 40 percent more than in 2012, but just a third of what they had parked in 2006. Indian accounts represented just 0.15 percent of the total holdings by foreigners in Swiss banks in 2013.When Indians talk about their country\u2019s illicit money, which is chiefly tax-evaded funds and income by illegal means, there is, of course, righteous contempt. But there is also a swagger over the sheer size of this shadow economy, because, after all, it is Indian. So a mere $2.3 billion was not what most Indians would have expected their rich and corrupt to have stashed in their Swiss nests.It is possible that Indian money has fled to safer havens over the years, or has returned to India disguised as respectable investments.Nobody knows just how big India\u2019s illicit economy is, but in recent years Indians have come to accept that it is very big. From the range of numbers that claim to measure the shadow economy, Indians tend to believe in the highest.A popular notion is that $1.4 trillion of illicit Indian money has flown out of the country over the decades and is held in various parts of the world. The apparent source of this figure is an analysis in 2009 by the academic R. Vaidyanathan. He had extrapolated it from a report released by Global Financial Integrity, a think tank in Washington; $1.4 trillion swiftly became a widely accepted estimate of Indian illicit money held abroad.Dev Kar, a co-author of that report, eventually dismissed the figure as an exaggeration. In a report he released in 2010, \u201cThe Drivers and Dynamics of Illicit Financial Flows from India: 1948-2008,\u201d he arrived at a more conservative estimate of about $500 billion as the value of illicit Indian money in foreign accounts. It was sexy enough.Mr. Kar\u2019s report hit India at a time when the middle class was convinced that it was disgusted by corruption. The $500 billion figure was picked up by politicians, reformers and officials, who quoted each other to support their claim.A study published in 2006 by Friedrich Schneider on the world\u2019s shadow economies dealt briefly with the \u201ctax morality\u201d of Germans. According to the study, two-thirds of the Germans surveyed regarded tax evasion as a \u201ctrivial offence,\u201d while only one-third judged stealing a newspaper this way. Indian tax morality is similar, but it makes a distinction between expatriate illicit money, which is viewed as a serious crime perpetrated by the very corrupt, and money held within India, which is perceived as a practical measure.Black money, as illicit money is called in India, is a significant part of Indian life. Most Indians of means, including many who protested on the streets against political corruption, deal in illicit money when they buy or sell real estate, or when they need foreign exchange to import goods. Huge amounts of cash travel across India during election seasons to bribe voters. Rich ladies prowl Delhi\u2019s malls with bricks of cash in their bags, or with attendants who carry the bricks for them. And, there is a network of quaint people much in demand for their ability to magically transmute rupees collected anywhere in India into dollars that can be made to appear almost anywhere else in the world.Advertisement"}

Most Americans Say Yes", "Date": "2014-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPulse of the PeopleThe Obama administration announced new regulations Monday meant to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.What do Americans believe about climate change, and how have those beliefs changed? Our overview follows.First, a majority of Americans say that global warming is indeed happening, and the numbers have held relatively steady since the mid-2000s.The number of Americans who believe in global warming has declined slightly since 2008, but there is reason to suspect that decline may soon reverse.Temperature trends, not economic trends, seem to drive changes in opinion.Rather, they found that opinion about global warming seemed to fluctuate with temperature changes. Although the beliefs of people who trust natural scientists remain steady over time, climate beliefs among the one-third of Americans who don\u2019t trust natural scientists are influenced by the prior year\u2019s average world temperature.\u201cFollowing record-high-temperature years, low-trust people are more likely to believe that the world has been warming,\u201d Mr. Krosnick said. \u201cExtreme weather events, however, have not had notable impact on public judgments of the existence or the seriousness of global warming.\u201dDemocrats trust scientists much more than Republicans do \u2014 and believe more in the existence of warming.While Americans believe global warming is happening, it\u2019s not one of their top concerns.But that\u2019s not to say that Americans aren\u2019t concerned at all.Most Americans say they are ready for their government to act.

But Israel has already denied permits for the three nominated ministers who live in the Gaza Strip, which has been under Hamas rule since 2007, to travel through its territory to attend Monday\u2019s ceremony in the West Bank, something a spokesman ascribed to \u201cissues of politics.\u201dSeparately, the Israeli Air Force struck two targets in Gaza early Monday morning, in what it called a response to two rockets fired from there in the past two days. There were no immediate reports of casualties.A senior Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of getting ahead of the decision-makers, said, \u201cWe\u2019re entering a new reality.\u201d\u201cThe question is what happens once the marriage is consummated \u2014 I think that\u2019s a new ballgame,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a situation that wasn\u2019t too good to begin with, it makes the ice that much thinner.\u201dAnd there may yet be disputes to resolve. Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, issued a statement early Monday morning warning that the faction does not \u201caccept the declaration of the government Monday\u201d if, as reported in the local news media, it would not include a ministry for prisoner affairs, transferring that responsibility to the P.L.O.Earlier on Sunday, Hamas officials had said that the ministers who had formed a shadow government in Gaza would immediately return to their posts within the political party or as university professors; Ismail Haniya, the Hamas prime minister, will be known simply as \u201cdeputy leader\u201d of the movement.The fate of more than 100,000 public-sector workers, generally two for every job, remains unclear. Similarly, uncertainty exists about the duplicate services, such as the two checkpoints \u2014 one run by Hamas and one by the Palestinian Authority \u2014 at the Erez crossing into Israel.Among the other critical questions is how the new government will be regarded by Washington and the West.Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, said Mr. Kerry had expressed concern to Mr. Abbas in their phone conversation Sunday about Hamas\u2019s role. \u201cThe secretary stated that the United States would monitor the situation closely and judge any government based on its composition, policies and actions,\u201d Ms. Psaki said.But Mr. Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday that Hamas \u201cis a terrorist organization that calls for the destruction of Israel, and the international community must not embrace it.\u201dThe senior Israeli official noted that the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia all considered Hamas a terrorist organization and that \u201cthere are legal implications\u201d as well as political ones \u201cfor passing money to a terrorist group.\u201dThough Israel has taken a hard line against the new government, it must strike a delicate balance, since the withdrawal of international aid could lead to a collapse of the Palestinian Authority. That would leave Israel responsible for the Palestinians\u2019 education, health care and economy.So far, the sanctions have been symbolic. Israel withheld some $6 million of the approximately $160 million in monthly taxes it collects on the Palestinians\u2019 behalf after the reconciliation pact was signed. It declared that Israeli officials would no longer meet their Palestinian counterparts, but such tasks were simply transferred from individual ministries to the Civil Administration, which handles relations with the West Bank, according to the agency\u2019s spokesman, Guy Inbar.\u201cNo project is delayed or canceled,\u201d said Mr. Inbar, noting that there had recently been joint meetings to discuss tourism and telecommunications.Fares Akram contributed reporting from Gaza, Said Ghazali from Jerusalem, and Michael R.

The goal is to push banks to lend the money to companies and individual borrowers.\u201cEurope is barely growing, inflation is low, and it cries out for more stimulus,\u201d said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Investments. \u201cThe question is, Will the E.C.B. do enough to satisfy investors?\u201dSpeculation over the E.C.B.\u2019s interest rate decision has sent foreign buyers into the American bond market in recent weeks. On Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 2.61 percent from 2.60 percent late Tuesday, while its price dipped 2/32, to 99 3/32. The 10-year yield fell as low as 2.45 percent last week, one of the lowest levels in almost a year.The main event this week for most investors will be the monthly jobs report from the Labor Department on Friday. Economists predict that employers added 220,000 jobs in May and that the unemployment rate remained steady at 6.3 percent.The payroll processor ADP said on Wednesday that businesses slowed their hiring last month, adding just 179,000 workers.

{"Headline": "Sales of Existing Homes Jumped Nearly 5% in May ", "Date": "2014-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sales of previously owned homes in the United States rose more than expected in May, and the stock of properties for sale was the highest in more than 18 months, suggesting that housing was pulling out of a recent slump.The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that existing-home sales increased 4.9 percent last month to an annual rate of 4.89 million units. It was the largest rise since August 2011.Economists had forecast that sales would rise 2.2 percent, for 4.73 million units annually.The housing recovery stalled in the second half of 2013 as interest rates increased and prices rose while the supply of properties for sale dwindled.Despite the second consecutive months of gains, sales were down 5 percent compared with May 2013. They remain down 9 percent from a peak of 5.38 million units, hit in July.Still, the increase in sales will be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which is closely watching the housing market as it contemplates the future course of monetary policy. The Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, has warned that a prolonged slump could undermine the economy.The sturdy housing report added to signs that economic activity had regained momentum after sliding in the first quarter.A separate report showed that manufacturing expanded strongly in June. The financial data firm Markit said its preliminary or \u201cflash\u201d manufacturing purchasing managers index for the United States rose to 57.5, the highest reading since May 2010.The index was 56.4 in May, and a reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity.While housing is showing tentative signs of recovery, progress will most likely be slow.First-time buyers, a necessary ingredient for a strong housing market, continue to hug the sidelines. Many have also been hampered by financial institutions\u2019 stringent lending practices.Last month, first-time buyers accounted for 27 percent of the transactions, hovering near their lowest level since the Realtors group started tracking the series.A market share of 40 to 45 percent for first-time buyers is considered ideal by economists and real estate professionals.The inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 6 percent from a year ago to 2.28 million in May. That was the highest level since August 2012.The month\u2019s supply of existing homes decreased to 5.6 months from 5.7 months in April. Six months\u2019 supply is normally considered a healthy balance between supply and demand.Still, the improved supply from March is helping to temper price increases. The median home price increased 5.1 percent from a year ago to $213,400. That was the smallest increase since March 2012. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Music, at Least While It Lasts", "Date": "2014-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Media EquationLate last Thursday, I stopped at the fruit stand and some big, vivid red grapes caught my eye. The vendor said a two-pound bunch would be $6, which seemed steep. I was about to tell him as much, and then came to my senses and gave him the money.I wondered why I hesitated when it came time to pony up and realized that, as just one more participant in the Something for Nothing economy, I\u2019d grown accustomed to getting all sorts of lusciousness for the price of zero. Throughout that day, I used a suite of services from Google \u2014 email, contacts, documents \u2014 for a price of nothing. I deployed a free app called HopStop to plot my subway route to Brooklyn to meet my daughter for dinner, then used free mapping built into my iPhone to navigate to the restaurant. Along the way, I listened to song after song on the free version of Spotify. There were some nominal charges for the data services, but in general, I was free-riding. The outbreak of free is being felt all over the economy, but music is an industry that has produced the soundtrack of contemporary American life. Artists are singing the blues about the crippling effects of streaming, and no one wants to be part of the day the music died. Music has been free for decades through the miracle of ad-supported radio, but streaming services feel different because I can listen to what I want, whenever I want. The implicit promise of radio has been that consumers will hear a song they love and buy it. But when I love something on Spotify, my response is to listen to it some more on Spotify. I could pay $10 a month for the premium version and have done so in the past, but for now, I\u2019m sticking with the free service and put up with an occasional commercial. With scarcity now gone, songs are in the air, a mist we move through like so much department store perfume. We are no longer collecting music; it is collecting us on various platforms. Many labels and the musicians and songwriters they work with say streaming outfits risk wiping them out by paying tiny royalties, but the people who make all that yummy music are actually being loved to death by fans who expect it to be free. And it\u2019s only going to become worse. Hand a music CD to a 10-year-old and ask her what it\u2019s for. Most will never see a song as something that was imprisoned on a disc or a download that you had to pay for. And it\u2019s not just tweens. A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale at our house and I was willing to part with only about half my books. But when I looked over my collection of CDs and thought about what I wanted to keep, my answer was, um, nothing. There were hundreds of them, carefully collected for more than a decade, some of them gifts, some of them even recorded by friends or bands I had written about, but they\u2019ve been idle for years. I priced them at a quarter each and then some guy offered $35 for the whole bunch and we caved. We even threw in the rack. Books have retained some value in an evolving personal media ecosystem, partly because the physical artifact is more attractive than the plastic CD case (which can be opened only with a crowbar). CD collections no longer signify cultural identity. (LPs, which are making a niche comeback, are a different matter.) Music\u2019s jailbreak began almost as soon as songs could be rendered in ones and zeros. When Steve Jobs of Apple decided that the price for a song was 99 cents, he \u201csaved\u201d a record industry besieged by piracy by burning about half of it down. People ceased buying albums and bought only the songs they wanted, a disaggregation that wiped out inefficiency \u2014 which is profit by another name. Between what I bought and what I burned, I ended up with about 7,000 songs. But guess what? I don\u2019t listen to those, either. Why would I when I can mindlessly push a single button? The acquisition also included the expensive Beats headphones \u2014 $300 and up in a variety of colors so they also serve as fashion accessory. People will still pay large money for devices, and this weekend, thousands of people will spend at least $250 for three-day access to the Governor\u2019s Ball Music Festival in New York. It\u2019s a curious disconnect: Fans will pay top dollar for a music accessory or a music event. They just won\u2019t pay for, oh yeah, music. On the bus ride home from dinner last week, I streamed most of the wonderful new album from Parquet Courts, courtesy of the Something for Nothing paradox. The $6 grapes were delicious, by the way, but I consumed them slowly and consciously, each one carrying not only lusciousness, but the knowledge that I had paid for them. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Voters Speak", "Date": "2014-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSouth Korea\u2019s ruling New Frontier Party barely held its own in local elections throughout the country last week. In 17 closely watched contests for nine provincial governors and mayors in eight major cities, South Korean President Park Geun-hye\u2019s conservatives won eight posts, while the opposition, left-of-center New Politics Alliance for Democracy won nine. A prominent ruling party candidate for mayor of Seoul, an important position, lost to the popular liberal incumbent, Park Won-soon. Overall, the results showed a roughly equal number of victories for both parties in their traditional local and regional strongholds. Political analysts believe that widespread popular discontent following April\u2019s ferry disaster helped account for the ruling party\u2019s so-so showing. And while the opposition did not do enough to exploit this unhappiness, the results nevertheless sent a strong warning to politicians across the spectrum that the government must do far more to tighten regulatory oversight and that values other than growth at any price will henceforth weigh heavily in voters\u2019 minds.After the election, Ms. Park said she would accelerate her three-year plan for economic innovation, including reforms in the public sector, to give the South Korean economy another boost. During the past couple of decades, South Korea has taken enormous economic strides. Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, expects South Korea to join the ranks of the advanced economies by 2018. But there are downsides to this growth that demand attention.South Korean men, for instance, work until the average age of 71.1 years, the second longest among O.E.C.D. countries. While the normal retirement age is 60, men work an extra 11 years because the social security system is woefully inadequate. A government survey found that the average income of those over 60 is $1,600 a month, and only 15 percent of this comes from social security. In addition, 42 percent of those over 60 saw themselves as poor. Women work until the average age of 69.8 years.There are, in short, distortions and flaws in the South Korean economic miracle. The elderly members of South Korea\u2019s rapidly aging society are especially in need of a more comfortable economic safety net and are deserving of more empathy from the government. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Can Skip the Fitting, Mom", "Date": "2014-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritical ShopperIN THE DECADE-PLUS since the psychologist Barry Schwartz published his oft-cited book \u201cThe Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less,\u201d the options available to the American bride have increased beyond measure. She can legally marry another woman in many states. She can skip the whole wedding racket entirely, in protest or preoccupation or boredom, and suffer no social stigma whatsoever. Or \u2014 and this is a hedge I have observed among many urban millennials \u2014 she can sort of back up slowly, shruggingly, consciously down the aisle: save the blood-diamond money for a down payment on a Clinton Hill condominium; hire friends to do the organic catering; and buy her frock, perhaps in electric-blue, from Etsy or similar.Indeed, given the current milieu, I\u2019d argue that a big, foofy Diana Spencer meringue of a dress is one of the more subversive outfits someone getting married can wear. Failing that unlikely purchase, there is Stone Fox Bride, the current wedding-wear darling of the jammin\u2019 and Instagrammin\u2019 set. This is not a place for purity ball enthusiasts (fathers formally guarding the virginity of their daughters, as chronicled by the Swedish photographer David Magnusson in a series of images making the rounds online). Jemima Kirke of \u201cGirls\u201d has posed for the lookbook, her pubic thatch seemingly visible through a long-sleeved, floor-length lace doily. Anatomically correct, if modestly sized, candles depicting the male member ($18) are among the curiosities offered. And as reading material, Stone Fox Tales, an offshoot of the store\u2019s main website, rivals Penthouse Forum.\u201cMy hubs and I met in Montauk at Surf Lodge,\u201d one of the tamer tales reads. He sent her a text. \u201cAnd then it was on.\u201d They make out for hours on a couch. \u201cAnd then it was really on.\u201d At the small but airy showroom, in an old-fashioned office building near Crate & Barrel with its Bridezillas brandishing scan guns, I encountered only one contradiction to the anything-goes house philosophy espoused by its co-founder, Molly Guy. \u201cYou can see the pasty,\u201d a salesclerk tsked to a blooming young brunette, referring to the minimal nipple cover. \u201cWe don\u2019t want pics with pasties staring at us.\u201d Certainly not.Colorful Moroccan carpets were flung down on the worn hardwood floors; hanging chad tinsel displays faintly recalled a 1970s variety show; and a mobile window sculpture by Dana Haim doubled as the ultimate fantasy cat toy. Volumes of erotica were arrayed tastefully with a Meret Oppenheim monograph and a copy of the Joan Didion novel \u201cPlay It As It Lays.\u201dThe young Ms. Didion, in fact, may well be the patron saint of this establishment, with her purposefully lank long hair, slender coffee-and-cigarettes frame and loner-bohemian California aura. Wreaths of dried flowers, or \u201ccrowns,\u201d are more prevalent here than veils.Since my own \u201chubs\u201d and I got hitched over a decade ago (we met at a birthday party in the East Village, and it was on), I enlisted a September 2014 bride of uncommon beauty and poise to peruse the thoughtfully wispy stock.She and another clerk, Nicole Alexander, spoke together in the 78 r.p.m. dialect that I have identified as \u201cmillennials facing an uncertain economy and too much Internet.\u201d Comprehending only intermittently, I sifted through a rack containing fragile vintage kimonos, boleros and a pair of palazzo pants with rhinestone-trimmed slash pockets ($1,400). One can also buy yoga pants that say across the bum, in more vulgar terms, Let\u2019s Call the Whole Thing Off.I tuned back in to find Ms. Alexander tying a glittery sash around the infinitesimal waist of my friend, who was clad in a piece of pleated cafe-colored chiffon from the 1930s ($675). It suited her very well. Then again, this is someone who could hop toward her groom in a potato sack and still elicit admiring sighs from their guests.She also tried the Lucinda, a bias-cut slip dress with a low back, fin and train made to order for $4,800 (less being more), plus a $1,000 rush fee, but $1,000 off in June and with one in a different color available off the rack for $3,500. (Wedding math can try even applied-mathematics majors.)\u201cWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\u201d the Pet Shop Boys wondered as Ms. Alexander helpfully wrote \u201cthe deets\u201d on a card, offered us nut brittle from a glass jar and then \u2014 a charming touch in a cold world \u2014 hugged us goodbye.I would venture that the sense of nose-thumbing that these gowns provide is factored into their cost. Since they don\u2019t look like much on the hanger, I recommend visitors psych themselves up by reading the evocative descriptions on the site. (Accessory recommendations include rubber Wellies and quaaludes.) The shop also offers centerpieces, wedding canopies and attire for flower gir \u2014 er, the Little Foxes.

{"Headline": "In the Shadow of Lebanon", "Date": "2014-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIraq is now peering into the abyss that Lebanon witnessed during the darkest days of its civil war, the first and longest sectarian conflict in the post-colonial Arab world. The conflict dragged on for 15 deadly years. The human costs, in a country smaller than Connecticut, were staggering: 150,000 killed and a million people \u2014 one-fourth of the population \u2014 displaced. The economy collapsed and destruction totaled $25 billion. Along the way, Lebanon\u2019s militias introduced tactics, most notably the suicide bomb, that have defined asymmetric warfare worldwide ever since.Over those years, from 1975 to 1990, the entire Middle East shook, as Lebanon\u2019s war ignited a rippling series of other conflicts, big and small, including an Israeli invasion in 1982 that turned into its own messy 18-year occupation. I lived through five years of Lebanon\u2019s multifaceted war. I spent plenty of time in basements-cum-bomb-shelters, waiting for incoming artillery or thunderous battles on the streets above to stop, debating with Lebanese about whether their little country could endure the venom consuming its 18 recognized Muslim, Christian, Druse and other sects.The civil war ended in 1990. The state barely survived. And nearly a quarter century later, the war\u2019s effects linger on, in political form, as Lebanon struggles to find a president amid sectarian turmoil. Hezbollah, a Shiite militia born during the war that later organized as a political party as well, is now powerful enough to say yea or nay to a president. Lebanon still offers many lessons for the region.Unfortunately, the scope of events over the past three weeks in Iraq, born of the same kinds of power-sharing disputes that ripped Lebanon apart, is bigger physically, politically, economically, militarily and regionally. Just for starters, Iraq is the size of California. The territory seized with astonishing speed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is the size of Indiana.Over all, Iraq is a geostrategic property of far greater value, not to mention the second-largest oil producer in OPEC. The weaponry on all sides is bigger and badder than in Lebanon. The hatreds may actually be deeper, the regional impact wider. The consequences \u2014 intended and unintended \u2014 could well have global import.The two countries have their own dynamics and flash points. But Iraq is more like Lebanon than Syria, where ISIS began its territorial sweep, because both Iraq and Lebanon are nascent democracies. The principle of power sharing is publicly embraced and politically enshrined, even if not adequately practiced. In contrast, Syria\u2019s three-year-old war has become intractable because President Bashar al-Assad clings to authoritarian power.The fractured communities in Lebanon and Iraq have been charting a course, albeit fitfully and bloodily, into a future quite different from the region\u2019s past. It\u2019s the struggle to move beyond primordial identities of clan, tribe, race and sect in the name of a wider national good. It\u2019s a challenge every democracy faces, including the United States in its own past Civil War and its current internal politicking. It\u2019s hard to get beyond self.Finding a new political formula that is equitable and just is the fundamental challenge across the Middle East, as activists and the huge population of young people demand a fairer share of power. This is the last bloc of countries to hold out against the democratic tide that has ended odious ideologies like apartheid and Communism over the past half century elsewhere. The stakes for the Middle East are historic.Iraqis from all sects and ethnicities will be stupidly self-destructive if they don\u2019t come to terms with one another quickly. They still have a chance to reverse course, reallocate power and repair political rifts in a way that Syria almost certainly cannot if Mr. Assad stays in power. They also have international interest in helping make it happen, as controversial as any form of outside diplomatic or military assistance may be.The alternative is the Lebanon situation, in which politics was hijacked by warlords, security forces were marginalized by law-defying militias, the economy survived off smuggling, and daily life was Darwinian. I once had to clean bits of body and car parts off my little balcony when a suicide bomber set himself off prematurely \u2014 one of many bizarre memories of life in Beirut. Fighting was never predictable. I had a chart on my wall of the constantly proliferating militias \u2014 four dozen or so by the time I left in 1985 \u2014 and their constantly shifting alliances and enmities. Allies one day could be trying to kill one another the next, even within sects, over issues that had digressed far from their common cause. It was not unusual to see Shiites fighting Shiites, Christians fighting Christians, and Sunnis fighting Sunnis. Iraq is already witnessing its own internecine clashes.The lessons of Lebanon apply to the United States as well. For all its wars elsewhere, one of the largest losses of American military life in a single incident since World War II was the loss of 241 peacekeepers in Beirut in 1983 \u2014 after Washington was seen to take sides in Lebanon\u2019s civil war.As Lebanon proved, the ultimate solution is political \u2014 and the solutions are often simple to the point of banality. Lebanon\u2019s war finally ended with only minor changes to the internal balance of power. The original formula at independence from France in 1943 \u2014 in an unwritten agreement, based on a dubious 1932 census \u2014 allocated six seats in the Parliament to Christians for every five seats given to Muslims. Under the peace accord in 1990, the ratio became parity. The presidency, reserved for a Christian, was weakened and the prime ministership, reserved for a Sunni, was strengthened. Shiites retained the post of parliamentary speaker. None of the positions were given to another sect. So little, for so many dead. Iraq beware.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Corporate Daddy", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor some time now, Republicans in Congress have given up the pretense of doing anything to improve the lot of most Americans. Raising the minimum wage? They won\u2019t even allow a vote to happen. Cleaner air for all? They may partially shut down the government in a coming fight on behalf of major polluters. Add to that the continuing obstruction of student loan relief efforts, and numerous attempts to defund health care, and you have a party actively working to make life miserable for millions.So, our nation turns to Starbucks. And Walmart. In the present moment, both of those global corporate monoliths are poised to do more to affect the huge chasm between the rich and everybody else than anything that\u2019s likely to come out of John Boehner\u2019s House of Representatives.As long as the Supreme Court says that corporations are citizens, they may as well act like them. Starbucks is trying to be dutiful \u2014 in its own prickly, often self-righteous, spin-heavy way \u2014 while Walmart is a net drain on taxpayers, forcing employees into public assistance with its poverty-wage structure.\u201cIn the last few years, we have seen the fracturing of the American dream,\u201d said the Starbucks chief executive, Howard Schultz, in announcing a company plan to reimburse the cost of college tuition for employees. \u201cThe question for all of us is, should we accept that, or should we try to do something about it?\u201dIt\u2019s a sad day when we have to look to corporations for education, health care and basic ways to boost the middle class. Most advanced nations do those things for their people. We used to \u2014 witness the G.I. Bill, which helped millions of returning soldiers get a lift to a better life. But you go to war against the income gap with the system you have, and ours is currently broken. By default, we have no choice but to lean on our corporate overlords.Walmart, the nation\u2019s top private employer and the world\u2019s largest public corporation, is a big part of the problem \u2014 and could be a big part of the solution. Their humiliating wages force thousands of employees to look to food stamps, Medicaid and other forms of welfare. A sign appearing at a Walmart in Ohio last year, asking people to donate food so that the company\u2019s employees \u201ccould enjoy Thanksgiving,\u201d was a perfect symbol of what\u2019s wrong with the nation\u2019s most despised retailer. Working at Walmart may not make you poor, but it certainly keeps you poor \u2014 at the expense of the rest of us.By one measure, done by House Democrats last year in looking at data from Wisconsin, the average Walmart superstore cost taxpayers $904,000 a year in various subsidies, or more than $5,000 per employee.Walmart disputes these figures, claiming the average full-time store worker makes at least $12 an hour, or enough to be just above the poverty level for a family of four. But these numbers are skewed by higher pay for management. The average \u201cassociate\u201d at Walmart makes $8.81 an hour \u2014 poverty wage \u2014 according to the market-research firm IBISWorld, as of 2011. Another independent source, Payscale, says the average is under $11 an hour. No matter the exact figure, there\u2019s no dispute that Walmart\u2019s business model forces thousands of hard-working people to look for outside help just to get by.And under that model, Walmart has made a fortune \u2014 $17 billion in profits last year, executive compensation for one man at the top in excess of $20 million a year, and a windfall making the six heirs of the founding Walton family worth at least $150 billion.What could change Walmart is growing public disdain for the company. A new poll by Lake Research Partners found that 28 percent of consumers surveyed have an unfavorable view of Walmart \u2014 almost five times the negative sentiment felt for Costco. Poor treatment of workers was cited most often as the reason not to shop there.At Starbucks, the work force is barely a tenth of Walmart\u2019s, 135,000 employees in the United States. But the company has long been a leader in providing decent wages, stock and retirement benefits, and health care \u2014 even for part-time employees. Now it\u2019s offering what it says is free college tuition for any employee.The fine print is less flashy. The college is online, at Arizona State University, and the tuition would be paid by way of reimbursement, after students have already spent thousands out of pocket.Walmart in 2010 pledged to spend $50 million over three years to offset some of the cost for a small percentage of employees who enrolled in a for-profit, online university. So far, it\u2019s been a bust \u2014 only about 400 have earned degrees. Why not follow the Starbucks model and offer free tuition to all employees?Sadly, this is the future. Congress could raise the minimum wage, make college more affordable, or even make it universally accessible for all qualified applicants. At the very least, it could reduce the student loan burden. These obvious remedies are anathema to Republicans.In the conservative view, the free market can take care of everything. But what you\u2019re hearing from bottom-line capitalists is that the system is in deep trouble. \u201cLabor and capital have to share in the rewards of a productive economy, and for the last 25 years labor has gotten the short end of the stick,\u201d said Bill Gross, the founder of the investment firm PIMCO, in a recent interview with Yahoo. Eventually, he said, \u201cit will be destabilizing.\u201dOne corporate titan says the American dream is shattered. Another captain of big money says we\u2019re reaching a breaking point.

{"Headline": "With New Palestinian Government Come Many Questions, and Some Answers", "Date": "2014-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat does Fatah and its leader, President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, hope to gain in the deal?Mr. Abbas is eager to regain control of the Gaza Strip and reunite it with the West Bank under his rule, to bolster his claim as leader of all the Palestinian people and show he can deliver Gaza for a peace deal with Israel. Reconciliation is also a prime concern for the Palestinian public, so it could boost his sagging popularity. Mr. Abbas, who is 79 and serving long past his term\u2019s 2009 expiration, is looking for a legacy and, many experts believe, an exit from the public stage, something elections could provide.What is in it for Hamas?Hamas, which grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, has been suffering politically and financially in recent years, particularly since last summer\u2019s ouster in Egypt of President Mohamed Morsi, a Brotherhood leader. Egypt\u2019s new military-backed government shut hundreds of smuggling tunnels that provided revenue to Hamas and critical materials for the Gaza economy, and it has also kept the Rafah crossing into Gaza closed. This has led to skyrocketing unemployment and fuel shortages in Gaza, and increased residents\u2019 sense of imprisonment. The new government promises to reopen the Rafah crossing, and relieve Hamas of the burden of providing for Gaza\u2019s day-to-day needs.Will this unite Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza?Travel between the West Bank and Gaza remains controlled by Israel, which might further restrict it as part of sanctions against the new government. But reconciliation certainly helps restore an emotional connection: already, people have welcomed the renewed circulation of newspapers from the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem across the territory. In the last several years, the separate governments have passed some separate laws that will need to be reconciled. Hamas has tried to impose Islamic mores on Gazan society, including dress codes at universities, and bans on women smoking water pipes or unwed couples walking on the beach; lifting them could lessen the alienation felt between residents.How will the new government change things on the ground?It remains unclear. The security forces in Gaza will remain in place, reporting to a new interior minister. Similarly, there is no plan yet on what to do about the 40,000 Gaza residents who have been working in the Hamas government and the 70,000 Fatah-affiliated employees of the Palestinian Authority who for years have been paid to sit idle.What might Israel do?In the past, Israel has withheld tax revenue it collects on the Palestinians\u2019 behalf, canceled permits that ease travel across the West Bank and Jerusalem, and closed the commercial crossing it controls into Gaza.

{"Headline": "A Crown Spurs Fashion in Spain", "Date": "2014-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn The RunwayThe coronation of Crown Prince Felipe de Borb\u00f3n as the new Spanish king and his wife, Letizia, as queen consort on Thursday is generally being greeted, anti-monarchists aside, as a new start for Spain; a smart move on the part of Felipe\u2019s father, King Juan Carlos; and the introduction of a new royal \u201cfashion icon\u201d \u2014 this last even though the event itself is billed as an austere affair, without the usual pomp and elaborate gowns a coronation implies.Nevertheless, comparisons between Letizia and the last young attractive royal to make fashion news, the Duchess of Cambridge, have been rife. Hello magazines everywhere have begun salivating about the cover possibilities. She is elegant! She is reed-like! She wears jewel tones!All of which is fair, and true, enough. But what all the breathless coverage thus far has missed is that the real significance of Letizia has less to do with the fact that she takes the sort of picture that feeds the celebrity maw, and more to do with the fact she embodies an opportunity for the Spanish fashion industry that comes along \u2014 well, once in a royal handover. She is a living, breathing marketing bonanza for both the mass market and the high-end apparel sector. And in this context, her importance, especially for a country whose economy has not entirely recovered from the recession, should not be underestimated.All that is about to change, however, in part because Letizia and her husband are expected to begin a royal tour following the coronation. Representing their country, they will also represent its industry. And that in turn represents a chance for Spanish fashion to raise its profile and, with it, its profits \u2014 in particular Spanish fashion beyond Zara and Mango, which arguably have enough profiles and profits (though Letizia has been known to wear both, in the high-low, Mrs. Obama-Duchess of Cambridge mode that has become par for the course in post-crisis democracies).After all, as much as anything the job of first spouse, even if just symbolic \u2014 especially because it is symbolic \u2014 has historically and currently involved acting as a billboard for the local fashion industry, no matter what the country. It\u2019s the reason Jacqueline Kennedy had to switch allegiance from Hubert de Givenchy to Oleg Cassini when her husband became president; why the Duchess of Cambridge favors Alexander McQueen and Jenny Packham; why Peng Liyuan wears Ma Ke; and why Mrs. Obama has been so deliberate about promoting new American designers like Jason Wu, Isabel Toledo and Thom Browne (though Mrs. Obama has also broken out of purely patriotic strictures and worn non-American designers such as Azzedine Ala\u00efa, Moschino and Junya Watanabe). Madrid Fashion Week has long been the neglected sibling of the European ready-to-wear industry \u2014 it does not draw anywhere near the same global attention as the big three of Milan, Paris and London (possibly because it inexplicably takes place this fall from Sept. 12 to 16, the same time as London Fashion Week) \u2014 so you can see why Letizia may represent a trend-changer.Certainly, when it comes to Spain, the high-street behemoths aside, most people outside the borders would be hard pressed to name the major homegrown designers \u2014 at least the ones who could influence global trends, are still working in Spain and are not owned by foreign groups. Which is to say: not Manolo Blahnik, who is based in London; not Fortuny, which has transmogrified into an Italian textile manufacturer; not Balenciaga, which is based in Paris, owned by the French conglomerate Kering and designed by the Asian-American Alexander Wang; and not Loewe, which is owned by LVMH and designed by Jonathan Anderson, a Brit. Not even Paco Rabanne, which is owned by the Puig Group, the Barcelona-based beauty conglomerate, but is shown at Paris Fashion Week, nor the up-and-coming label Delpozo, which left Spain to show at New York Fashion Week to build buzz, following in the footsteps of the street-style label Custo Barcelona.Rather, think Felipe Varela, Lorenzo Caprile and Ailanto. Er ... ? Exactly.Yet these designers, who have been part of Madrid Fashion Week, are also the designers most worn by Letizia over the last 10 years. She chose Felipe Varela, for example, in 2012 for an official visit to Portugal (black and white lace off-the-shoulder cocktail number) and for the 2009 state visit of Nicolas Sarkozy, then the French president, and his wife, Carla Bruni (a raspberry bandage dress that was widely said to trump the French first lady\u2019s Dior), and donned Caprile for a 2011 dinner with Prince Charles, to name a few of the events that have been suddenly resurrected by Get the Look! sites around the Internet. With her husband\u2019s coronation, Letizia doesn\u2019t just become queen, she becomes the equivalent of a global brand communication superhighway. In her role, and her wardrobe, lies the power to change a designer\u2019s name recognition globally, which in turn changes retailers\u2019 desire to stock said designer, which changes the designer\u2019s business. It effectively takes the obsession with how a first lady looks and what she wears, that much-derided international pastime, and turns it into a tool for national economic growth.

{"Headline": "Belgians Share Their Land With War\u2019s Reminders", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Great WarYPRES, Belgium \u2014 The padlocked cage beside the driveway on the Butaye family farm near this town in western Belgium is almost full of rusting bombs again. Since January, Stijn Butaye has collected 46 mortar shells on his family\u2019s 100 acres, World War I munitions he found among the sugar beet and potato fields, sometimes with the help of his metal detector.Mr. Butaye\u2019s father, Luc, won\u2019t even plow two of his fields for fear of what the blades might hit. Not long ago, a neighbor riding his tractor ruptured an aging shell, and the explosion sent shrapnel through his windshield, tearing off a chunk of his ear.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what could happen,\u201d said Stijn Butaye, 26, who has built a small museum beside the barn with hundreds of items \u2014 including shoes and eyeglasses and razors and a perfectly preserved gas mask \u2014 that he has found on his family\u2019s property. \u201cWe just use that land for grazing the cows.\u201dIt has been 100 years since World War I erupted in these parts. The men who survived the thousands of miles of muddy trenches that surrounded this strategically important region are long gone and buried. But the earth, in its own way, has become the last witness, coughing up constant reminders of a bloody and relentless war that would demolish empires, leave at least 8.5 million soldiers and seven million civilians dead, and produce legacies that continue to play out today.Around Ypres, the Allies and the Germans fought for nearly four years in a marathon slugfest that produced some of the war\u2019s most famous and deadly battles. It was here that the Germans first used chlorine and mustard gas on Allied troops. Yet neither side ever made much headway despite artillery barrages so fierce and long that they wiped away roads and villages, leaving miles in which not a building or a tree or a blade of grass was left.The area became a battlefield when German forces wheeled north after being stymied in their initial drive on Paris in the war\u2019s opening months in 1914. After that, the conflict shifted toward Belgium as the Germans tried a flanking maneuver and the Allies raced to protect their control of the vital French seaports of Calais and Boulogne. There, along a front stretching southward from the Belgian coast, the opposing armies settled in, turning fertile farmlands into nightmarish killing fields.The padlocked cage beside the driveway on the Butaye family farm near Ypres, a town in western Belgium, is almost full of rusting bombs again. Since January, Stijn Butaye has collected 46 mortar shells on his family\u2019s 100 acres, World War I munitions he found among the sugar beet and potato fields, sometimes with the help of his metal detector.Experts say that in one particularly intense three-month campaign in 1917, known as the Third Battle of Ypres, or the Battle of Passchendaele, the British alone fired more than four million shells. In the end, more than 500,000 men had been killed or wounded, and the constant shelling had turned the landscape into a lifeless swamp. Up to 30 percent of the artillery shells fired never went off, experts say. Some were duds, but many simply slid deep into the mud without exploding.The land here still holds so many explosives that almost every construction project poses a danger. Every turned spade has the potential to unearth not just munitions but bones, some carefully laid to rest in full uniform, others blown apart. A local highway stands half finished; work ended abruptly because the bulldozers began uncovering graves, and the British government quickly objected to the project.It is impossible to live around Ypres without feeling the weight of living atop a former battlefield where young men from Germany, France, Britain, Belgium, Australia, Canada and North Africa died, some as young as 15.The archaeologists also unearthed a stretch of trench that has been partly restored for tourists. Aurel Sercu, one of the Diggers, walked the site recently, explaining how tunnels had led away from the trenches to an underground pump room, a changing area, a workroom and a stock of ammunition, all underwater now. If warm weather ever dries out the area, he said, the ground above might collapse, as has happened elsewhere.Much of what the Diggers found was either reburied with the soldiers or went to museums. But Mr. Sercu, a retired language teacher, has kept some of what was not wanted, including a broken crucifix, a harmonica and a pair of almost perfectly preserved wool socks found in the mud at the bottom of one of the tunnels.When an item, like a straight razor, had a name and number scratched on its side, Mr. Sercu tried to track down the soldier\u2019s family. Once, he actually succeeded, but the soldier\u2019s last living relative had just died. The woman\u2019s husband sent Mr. Sercu a picture of the soldier and said he should keep the razor. Mr. Sercu handles the photograph with care.\u201cThis man died here, and he must know we are looking at his photo,\u201d Mr. Sercu said. \u201cThere is so much history here. You can\u2019t help but become obsessed.\u201dThe war had barely ended when Belgian refugees began returning, hoping to farm the rich Flanders fields. Some committed suicide when they saw what had happened to their farms and villages. But others simply went to work rebuilding, relying heavily on German war reparations, which arrived by train in the form of fruit trees and cattle.The detritus of war was everywhere, and the simplest thing to do was to fill the trenches and rebuild. But the war could not be swept away so easily. Many markers remain. Cows graze next to German bunkers and drink from shell craters that are now watering holes. In aerial shots, the outlines of the trenches can still be seen because the vegetation grows greener depending on what lies below.Some experts say that it is time to do more to rid the land of the war\u2019s effects, particularly by detecting unexploded shells. Marc Van Meirvenne, a soil expert at Ghent University in Belgium who has studied the Ypres region, says it has unusually high levels of copper and lead, a consequence of the shells and the lead ball shrapnel inside many of them, though probably not sufficient to be a health hazard. However, he said, ground-penetrating radar could easily be used to spot shells.But many farmers are not interested, mostly because digging up the shells may change the soil composition, bringing up the blue clay that is several feet beneath the surface. Most of them, like Mr. Butaye, have a working knowledge of World War I munitions, easily identifying whether they came from German or Allied forces and how likely they are to explode. Both Belgium and France have specialists assigned to collect the shells. The Belgian unit near Ypres collects about 100 tons of munitions a year. A French unit working near Verdun collects about half as much. In recent years, the Belgian government has passed laws preventing amateurs from digging.Officials in Ypres say there is more interest in the war today than there was 20 years ago. Tens of thousands of British schoolchildren come here every year, as do thousands of the soldiers\u2019 family members and history buffs, contributing about 40 million euros a year to the local economy. Joseph Verschoore, the deputy mayor of Ypres, said that even Germans were beginning to show interest.\u201cI think before they were not always at ease,\u201d Mr. Verschoore said. \u201cThey were maybe afraid that the people here were still angry. But now there is more understanding that there was a regime there, and it was not very good for their people, either. Many of the German soldiers had no idea why they were here.\u201dBut some bitterness lingers. Stijn Butaye\u2019s grandfather, who bought the farm in 1960, was eager to rid it of any signs that the Germans had once camped there. He tried to blow up a bunker near the house, and objected to his grandson\u2019s hobby.\u201cWhenever he takes a picture of the house, he cuts the bunker out,\u201d Mr. Butaye said. \u201cHe hates that it was a German bunker.\u201dChristopher F. Schuetze contributed\nreporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": " Met Opera Tax Filing Reveals Pay For Gelb ", "Date": "2014-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Metropolitan Opera, which is seeking concessions from its workers amid tough labor talks, reported in a tax filing on Monday that its general manager, Peter Gelb, had earned a total of $1.8 million in pay and benefits in 2012 \u2014 but said that he had since taken a pay cut.The disclosure, in a tax return nonprofits are required to make each year, comes at a delicate time for the Met, which is seeking to cut the pay and benefits of its workers to deal with what the company recently told its unions was \u201cone of the biggest financial challenges in its 131-year history.\u201d The Met said that Mr. Gelb\u2019s 2012 compensation reflected a raise he had received that year, and that this April he had voluntarily taken a 10 percent pay cut, bringing his base pay to $1.395 million a year.The Met, which had an annual budget of $327 million for the 2012-13 season, is a complex organization that employs 1,600 full-time and seasonal workers and another 1,800 part-time workers; puts on more than 200 opera performances a year; and reaches millions of people through its broadcasts of operas to movie theaters, which Mr. Gelb began.The company said in a statement that Mr. Gelb was prepared to cut his pay further \u201cto match the percentage of cuts taken by the Met\u2019s union employees\u201d in contract talks. Contracts for the opera house\u2019s unions expire on July 31, and the opening talks have been contentious. The tax filing also reflected the high pay of some members of the Met\u2019s unionized work force. Three of the company\u2019s five highest-paid workers, according to the filing, were members of Local 1 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, whose total pay and benefits were each more than $450,000 that year. The highest-paid member of the orchestra, a concertmaster, earned $394,652 in pay and benefits that year, the filing said.The Met is seeking to cut its labor costs to deal with a number of serious challenges: box-office revenues have been declining; costs have been rising; and although the company has bridged that gap with record fund-raising, it has also drawn heavily on its endowment. The Met\u2019s endowment was valued at $253 million at the end of last year \u2014 less than its operating expenses that year, which were $327 million. The Met said that its proposals \u2014 which call for changing work rules that lead to a great deal of overtime and extra pay; altering health benefits; and capping pension benefits \u2014 would cut its labor costs by just over 16 percent a year. Unions said those changes would cut deeper. Some labor leaders questioned Mr. Gelb\u2019s pay, given the Met\u2019s struggles, and said it showed that the company could seek economies elsewhere.Alan S. Gordon, the executive director of the American Guild of Musical Artists, which represents the chorus, said it was \u201cobscene to pay him so much money when he\u2019s looking to destroy the lives of other people.\u201dTino Gagliardi, the president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, which represents the orchestra, said he did not begrudge Mr. Gelb\u2019s earnings, but wished he had more success attracting audiences.\u201cLocal 802 doesn\u2019t take any issue with the general manager of the Met earning a competitive salary,\u201d Mr. Gagliardi said. \u201cOur position is that the person needs to be effective in that position.\u201dD. Joseph Hartnett, the assistant department director of stagecraft at the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, a union with six locals at the Met, said the filing showed Mr. Gelb\u2019s total compensation rising even as that of the highest paid Local 1 members had dropped. He said it showed that \u201cthis is more than just a labor cost issue, this is a total spending issue.\u201dIn a recent statement summarizing financial data, which it had shared with its unions, the Met reported that the average full-time chorus member cost the company $300,000 in the 2012-13 season ($200,000 of that in pay, and another $100,000 in benefits), while the average full-time member of the orchestra cost the company $285,000 ($200,000 in pay, and $85,000 in benefits). Some choristers said that the Met performed many long, chorus-heavy operas that year. Mr. Gelb\u2019s record earnings in 2012 reflected a raise that he was given that March when he signed a new 10-year contract, which brought his base salary to $1.55 million, the Met said. They also reflected $177,000 in retirement and medical benefits, which included what the Met described as an unsolicited gift from a donor to create a supplemental retirement plan for him. Mr. Gelb previously took a pay cut at the end of 2008 to deal with the financial crisis. That year, the Met said, he and the company\u2019s senior management took 10 percent pay cuts, reducing his base pay to $1.215 million from $1.35 million. Those cuts were restored in several stages. The new pay cut in April brings his base pay to $1.395 million a year, the Met said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Group of 7 Backing, Obama Gives Russia One-Month Ukraine Deadline", "Date": "2014-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 With the backing of other world leaders, President Obama effectively set a one-month deadline for Moscow to reverse its intervention in Ukraine and help quash a pro-Russian separatist uprising or else he said it would face international sanctions far more severe than anything it had endured so far.Mr. Obama and other leaders of seven major democracies meeting here demanded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia recognize and negotiate directly with the newly elected leader of Ukraine, stop the flow of fighters and arms across the border and press separatists to disarm, relinquish seized public buildings and join talks with the central authorities in Kiev.\u201cRussia continues to have a responsibility to convince them to end their violence, lay down their weapons and enter into a dialogue with the Ukrainian government,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a news conference alongside Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain after a meeting of leaders of the Group of 7 industrial powers. \u201cOn the other hand, if Russia\u2019s provocations continue, it\u2019s clear from our discussions here that the G-7 nations are ready to impose additional costs on Russia.\u201dFor the first time, Mr. Obama laid out a time frame, saying that the process could not drag out.\u201cWe will have a chance to see what Mr. Putin does over the next two, three, four weeks,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cand if he remains on the current course, then we\u2019ve already indicated what kinds of actions that we\u2019re prepared to take.\u201dEuropean leaders have resisted such an escalation at least in part because their countries have much deeper economic ties to Russia than the United States does. Germany receives about one-third of its natural gas from Russia. Britain has extensive banking ties. France does a thriving arms business with Moscow.American and European officials are hoping that Mr. Putin\u2019s decision to pull some troops back from the border signals that he wants to defuse the confrontation, either because of the damage done so far to his own economy or because he did not find as much popular support for joining Russia in eastern Ukraine as he did in Crimea.The Group of 7\u2019s summit meeting was the first in two decades to exclude Russia, which began attending as a guest in 1993 and joined as a full-fledged member in 1998 but was suspended after annexing Crimea. Even so, Mr. Hollande, Mr. Cameron and Ms. Merkel all scheduled individual meetings with Mr. Putin for Thursday or Friday; Mr. Hollande, in fact, hosted him for a light supper just after dining with Mr. Obama.The issue of meeting with Mr. Putin generated a \u201cvery detailed discussion\u201d during the leaders\u2019 private session, said Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada, who, like Mr. Obama, opposed doing so. \u201cWe\u2019re all agreed on what the next steps would be should we not see appropriate change in Putin\u2019s behavior,\u201d Mr. Harper said afterward.Mr. Cameron defended meeting separately with Mr. Putin. \u201cIt\u2019s right to have this dialogue, particularly if you have a clear message and a clear point to make,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a world of difference between having a dialogue with President Putin and excluding someone\u201d from the summit meeting.Mr. Hollande likewise brushed off the dispute. \u201cThe important thing is, we have the same language, the same arguments on Ukraine all together,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe are seven.\u201d\u201cIt has an impact on the French economy; it has an impact on the European economy,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. But Mr. Obama said he had no control over the inquiry. \u201cThose are decisions that are made by an independent Department of Justice,\u201d he said.The careful choreography of diplomatic dinners extended to Berlin, where Ms. Merkel returned after Thursday\u2019s meetings to host Mr. Poroshenko for the second time in less than a month. Ms. Merkel was unusually effusive, stressing that \u201cGermany would like to be very helpful\u201d as he tackles the huge tasks of maintaining national unity, sovereignty and stability in a shaky economy.\u201cYour help is needed as never before,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko replied. \u201cUkraine is paying a heavy price\u201d for its turn toward Europe.In Brussels, Mr. Obama skated lightly over the disparate positions regarding Mr. Putin. \u201cDo I expect unanimity among the 28 E.U. members?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve now been president five and a half years, and I\u2019ve learned a thing or two about the European Union.\u201d There will be disagreements among members, he said, and \u201cwe take that for granted.\u201dMr. Obama used the occasion to pledge again to help the European Union combat attempts by Russia to use energy resources as a weapon. But he emphasized the need to bear some losses to defend shared values.\u201cEuropeans have to stand up for those ideals and principles even if it creates some economic inconvenience,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cif we have sectoral sanctions, I think it will inevitably hit Russia a lot worse than it hits Europe, which have much more diversified and resilient economies.\u201d James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels, Alison Smale from Berlin, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Lowers Gas Mileage on 6 Models, All 2013-14s", "Date": "2014-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the second time in less than a year, the Ford Motor Company is lowering the fuel-economy ratings for some of its vehicles.The automaker said on Thursday that it would reduce the mileage rating on six new models, most of them hybrids, and pay $125 to $1,050 to customers who own or lease about 200,000 of the cars in the United States.The vehicles include four versions of the 2014 Ford Fiesta, as well as the hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions of the 2013-14 C-Max and Ford Fusion and the hybrid version of the 2013-14 Lincoln MKZ. Most of the vehicles\u2019 combined city and highway rating will be lowered by one to five miles per gallon; the MKZ will be reduced the most, by seven miles per gallon, to 38 from 45.The announcement came during increasing federal scrutiny of automakers over safety and fuel-economy standards.Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at AutoTrader.com, said that Ford\u2019s actions came \u201cagainst two significant backdrops: G.M.\u2019s recall mess, which has prompted all automakers to address issues quickly so as not to be accused of dragging their feet, and automakers addressing fuel economy misstatements.\u201d\u201cWe apologize to our customers and will provide good-will payments to affected owners,\u201d Alan R. Mulally, Ford\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cWe also are taking steps to improve our processes and prevent issues like this from happening again.\u201dFord is not alone is overstating the fuel efficiency of its vehicles. In November 2012, after an E.P.A. investigation into consumer complaints that their cars were underperforming, Hyundai and Kia Motors said that they would begin to reimburse consumers and restate gas mileage estimates for about 900,000 vehicles sold in the United States.The automakers, which are both controlled by the Hyundai Motor Group, set aside about $400 million to settle consumer lawsuits and compensate drivers that were affected by the incorrect ratings.Christopher Grundler, director of the E.P.A.\u2019s office of transportation and air quality, said Ford notified the regulatory agency of the issue on March 28, after internal testing had revealed the error, and the agency began retesting vehicles with Ford.\u201cThe E.P.A.\u2019s investigation into this matter is ongoing,\u201d Mr. Grundler said. \u201cWe are interested and will continue to look for underlying causes of the error.\u201dMr. Grundler said that Ford, which was not fined, has agreed to apply stricter standards on fuel economy testing, which would, essentially, require the company to double-check its tests before manufacturing vehicles. Federal regulators are considering rules that would require all automakers to go through this process, he added.Jack R.

{"Headline": "Europe Struggles to Avoid Deflation\u2019s Grip", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA produce merchant at a food market. After a 5-year debt crisis, in a growing number of euro zone countries, businesses faced with slumping demand have been pressured to cut prices.ATHENS \u2014 In her upscale three-story beauty salon in a middle-class suburb of Athens, Doria Tsirigotis used to charge 30 euros for a haircut. But when a wrenching recession set in, her competitors started cutting their prices, first to 20 euros, then to 10 and even as low as 5 \u2014 or less than $7.Ms. Tsirigotis tried to resist discounting her prices. But as her clients lost jobs or had their wages cut, she eventually lowered her rates. Soon, revenues dwindled and her debts mounted, and she had to let go of all but two of her 13 employees. Last month, she downsized to a tiny salon across the street, renamed Cheap \u2018N\u2019 Chic \u2014 more fitting to the times.\u201cWhen prices fall so much, you can\u2019t not follow the trend,\u201d Ms. Tsirigotis said, gazing at the now-darkened beauty boutique she ran for 20 years. \u201cBut in such an environment, no one wins.\u201dWhile consumers welcome lower prices, economists are worried that an outbreak of ultralow inflation across the 18-nation euro zone is doing more harm than good to the bloc\u2019s economic recovery.The situation has grown so alarming that the central bank is expected on Thursday to take extraordinary measures to try to stimulate the economy. Not only is it expected to cut its main interest rate for the first time since November 2013, but analysts also anticipate it will start charging commercial banks to keep money in its vaults \u2014 the imposition of so-called negative interest rates \u2014 whose consequences might be hard to predict.The central bank\u2019s moves would be aimed at preventing low inflation from becoming outright deflation: a tailspin of falling prices and wages from which it can be difficult for economies to recover. In such an environment, consumers and companies may delay spending in anticipation that prices will fall further, which would only exacerbate the economic problems.That problem plagued Japan\u2019s moribund economy for two decades, and officials are only barely starting to halt the price declines.After years of a debt crisis, a number of countries in the euro zone are grappling with the effects of economic lethargy. At clothing stores, cellphone companies and factories making items as disparate as aluminum and tiles, owners faced with slumping demand have been pressured to cut their prices. In hard-hit countries, wages have also fallen sharply from precrisis levels.Especially in the most fragile economies, the dynamic is crimping growth and dampening government efforts to pay down debt, regain competitiveness and tackle unemployment.\u201cThe big picture is that with low inflation, it is more difficult for debt to come down and for economic growth to come back, so you could have a period of stagnation,\u201d said Reza Moghadam, the director of the European department at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He recently coined the term \u201clowflation\u201d to describe the euro zone\u2019s dilemma.Critics say the European Central Bank has delayed acting for so long that the euro zone economy already risks becoming stagnant like that of Japan \u2014 a charge that the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, has disputed. Instead, Mr. Draghi has said, the bank is waiting for further data to confirm that low inflation is widespread enough to warrant remedies.Already deflation has troubled four euro zone countries \u2014 Portugal, Cyprus, Slovakia and especially Greece, which has sustained an 18 percent plunge in wages since 2008, and where high unemployment has contributed to a decline in prices for more than a year. Elsewhere in the euro zone, inflation is worrisomely low.\u201cInflation is so low,\u201d said Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London, \u201cbecause wages have fallen sharply and consumer demand and investment have been depressed.\u201d In addition, banks have curbed lending, stifling thousands of small and midsize businesses, which create the majority of jobs across the euro zone.\u201cSo economies are not growing as much as they could,\u201d Mr. Tilford said. \u201cHuman and physical resources are not being employed and prices are pushed down further.\u201dHe is among economists who say the E.C.B. should be trying to push inflation much higher than its 2 percent target to lift prices and incomes. Doing so, they argue, would create a virtuous growth-and-investment cycle that would also help countries reduce their debt burdens.But that is easier said than done. The bank\u2019s benchmark interest rate is at 0.25 percent, already a record low for the euro zone. So plans to trim it slightly may produce only a modest stimulus. The bank is also expected to try prodding banks to lend, but how quickly that would lift deeply troubled countries is unclear. And in the near term, it will be difficult to stoke inflation, even in Germany, where the rate is nearly 1 percent.While the stimulus may help weak economies like those of Greece, Portugal, Italy and Cyprus, Germany is wary of allowing inflation to increase, which evokes dark memories of more unstable times in the days before World War II. Somewhat higher inflation in Germany would be useful to the other countries in the euro zone, say economists, by making workers in other countries more competitive. But if the bank\u2019s efforts fall short, economists say, the low inflation in euro zone countries could turn into a deflationary trend, similar to what has taken hold in Greece.\u201cGreece may be a front-runner in terms of telling us what may happen to other euro zone countries that are subject to lowflation and confronting deflationary futures,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economist who was a member of the European Commission\u2019s task force for Greece until this year.Greek inflation fell below zero more than a year ago. Deflation is endangering the country\u2019s ability to service its staggering \u20ac318 billion debt, as falling wages and slower economic activity reduce government tax revenue.The economy has shrunk about 25 percent in the last five years, raising Greece\u2019s debt as a percentage of economic output. Today, Greek debt has surged to 175 percent of gross domestic product, from 130 percent in 2010. While inflation would help reduce the interest Greece pays on the debt, deflation has made the interest burden larger.The ripple effects of deflation are being felt throughout the Greek economy.Lefteris Potamianos, a longtime real estate agent, was about to make a rare sale on an apartment in central Athens last month when the deal ground to a halt. Property values have fallen by 40 percent to 60 percent since 2008. The price of the apartment, once about \u20ac1 million, had dropped to \u20ac400,000. But the buyer held off to see if it would fall even more, a reflection of deflationary psychology.Not only did Mr. Potamianos lose a badly needed commission, but notaries and lawyers also lost business, as did renovators poised to refurbish the apartment. And the Greek government, he said, would not reap around \u20ac70,000 in taxes on the transaction.Across town, Nikolas Varelas, the owner of Varelas Home Design, has cut prices on the decorative tiles, designer faucets and other home furnishings in his showroom by 45 percent to 60 percent. Even with that deep discounting, \u201csales are still low,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause people don\u2019t have money.\u201dThat is partly because wages have slumped. To avoid having to dismiss anyone, Mr. Varelas cut salaries by 40 percent. Ms. Tsirigotis, the hair salon owner, also lowered wages and cut her own salary by two-thirds before eventually having to lay people off.Over all, average hourly labor costs in Greece fell last year to \u20ac13.60, from \u20ac17 in 2010.Such declines theoretically have a silver lining, by making Greek products more competitive for export. In reality, though, manufacturers say any savings has largely been negated by a raft of new taxes, including a 23 percent value-added tax and a 20 percent tax on energy costs, levied by the government to fill its coffers.\u201cThere has been such a high level of taxation on production that these increases have far outstripped any benefits made on the wage front,\u201d said Evangelos Mytilineos, vice chairman of the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises and the president of Mytilineos Holdings, one of Europe\u2019s largest aluminum producers.Mr. Mytilineos says he is hoping that the European Central Bank will help. \u201cWe are going through extraordinary circumstances in the periphery of Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe E.C.B. needs to act with extraordinary policies.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the reason that deflation in Greece endangers the country\u2019s ability to repay its debt. It is because government tax revenue is imperiled, not because of the declining value of the money being used to repay the debts.Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

To play Bassam Al Fayeed, a Middle Eastern dictator\u2019s son living incognito as a Beverly Hills pediatrician named Barry on FX\u2019s new \u201cTyrant,\u201d Adam Rayner traded the callow sexual maneuverings he optimized in British series like \u201cMistresses\u201d and \u201cAt Home With the Braithwaites\u201d for the gravitas befitting a family man.But whose family? When he is finally persuaded to attend his nephew\u2019s wedding, Barry defiantly opts for an economy-class seat on the empty airliner his father has bought out to fly him, his California-girl wife and two typically American teenagers to his native country for the first time in two decades. Once he arrives at his parents\u2019 palace, it becomes clear why he chose to abandon his former life. Something wicked this way comes, and the most evil force isn\u2019t necessarily the most obvious one. In a phone interview from Tel Aviv, where he is filming this series created by Gideon Raff, one of the forces behind Showtime\u2019s \u201cHomeland,\u201d Mr. Rayner, 37 \u2014 who was raised between a farm in England and Northern California, attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and appeared a couple years back on TNT\u2019s \u201cHawthorne\u201d \u2014 talked with Kathryn Shattuck about preparing for the role that could just be his big breakthrough. These are excerpts from their conversation.Q. So, are we to assume that Barry is the tyrant here?Were you in the market for a series?What normally happens with these kinds of big jobs is that they search like hell for a year or so to find someone, and when they\u2019re absolutely desperate and can\u2019t find anyone else, they come to me. My agent asked me to videotape an audition for a 40-year-old Arab family man. I said, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d Somehow I fit the bill. That\u2019s quite a palace your fictional family lives in. Where do you imagine \u201cTyrant\u201d is set?It\u2019s deliberately ambiguous. It\u2019s supposed to bring to mind Syria, Jordan, Egypt. Not so much the Gulf states. But Egypt would be a good example of what supposedly, up until recently, was a progressive regime. Syria is perhaps a better example of what happens when things go really wrong.How do you prepare to be a ruthless dictator?The main thing for me was an understanding of where he comes from. Being the son of the ruling family in the Middle East, he would have a grasp of the history and religion and politics, which I don\u2019t, so I read as much as I could to fill that gap. I read books on the Hussein family, the Assad family, the Arab Spring and Islam. Beyond that, Barry is a family man, and he\u2019s a doctor. But I didn\u2019t feel like it was necessary to learn how to perform surgery. I would imagine that many American women of a certain age remember you as Dominic, the dishy younger boyfriend of Siobhan on the BBC series \u201cMistresses.\u201d Was that a significant role for you or merely for us?Really? How did they even see it over here? It was my first kind of juicy TV role, three seasons working with fabulous actors and having loads of great fun. And it also brought me together with the director S. J. Clarkson, who brought me together with \u201cHunted\u201d [the BBC series on which he played an international man of mystery]. I owe a lot to her. You\u2019ve said you found the courage at Durham University, where you majored in English, to admit that you really wanted to act. I guess it wasn\u2019t such a bad decision after all.To be honest, unless you rocket straight to stardom as a gorgeous young vampire, you can spend a lot of time working behind a bar. I had some great high points and thought: \u201cThis is fantastic. I\u2019m going to be a huge star.\u201d Then something happens, and you can\u2019t get a job to save your life. Only in the last few years have I finally allowed myself to say, simply, \u201cI am an actor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But unless you\u2019re radically different from most of us, much of what you eat comes from corporations that process, market, deliver and sell \u201cfood,\u201d a majority of which is processed beyond recognition.The problem is that real food isn\u2019t real profitable. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to market fruit and vegetables without adding value,\u201d says Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. \u201cIf you turn a potato into a potato chip you not only make more money \u2014 you create a product with a long shelf life.\u201d Potatoes into chips and frozen fries; wheat into soft, \u201cenriched\u201d bread; soybeans into oil and meat; corn into meat and a staggering variety of junk.How do we break this cycle? You can\u2019t blame corporations for trying to profit by any means necessary, even immoral ones: It\u2019s their nature.Food companies are well aware of the health crisis their products cause, and recognize that the situation is unsustainable. But one theory has it that as long as even one of the big food companies remains cynical and uncaring about its market, they all must remain so.The food industry also wants us to ignore its use of that strategy to increase its market share and profits; and it wants to maintain legitimacy at a time when community groups and public health officials are, writes Ken, \u201cdemanding limits to their involvement\u201d in supplying food to children.Our efforts to demand limits on the sale of junk to children are a threat to Big Food. If we succeed, it fails, or at least suffers. But if industry succeeds, whether in selling blatant junk or re-engineered versions that are low in fat or sodium or gluten- or sugar-free or reduced-calorie or high fiber or whatever \u2014 companies can create any frankenfood they feel will sell \u2014 we will continue to suffer. (Nestle often says, \u201cA slightly-better-for-you junk food is still junk food.\u201d) Our health will decline further, the environment will be further degraded, and our health care system (and therefore economy) will spend an increasingly disproportionate amount of money on diet-generated chronic disease.If the most profitable scenario means that most food choices are essentially toxic \u2014 in the sense that overconsumption will cause illness \u2014 that\u2019s a failure of the market, not of individual choice. And government\u2019s rightful role is not to form partnerships with industry so that the latter can voluntarily \u201csolve\u201d the problem, but to oversee and regulate industry. Its mandate is to protect public health, and one good step toward fulfilling that right now would be to regulate the marketing of junk to children. Anything short of that is a failure.Maureen Dowd is off today. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sarajevo, Divisions That Drove an Assassin Have Only Begun to Heal", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Great WarBut for all the excited chatter among the tourists on the sidewalk where the 19-year-old Princip fired his Browning semiautomatic pistol, killing the 50-year-old heir to the Hapsburg throne and his pregnant consort, there is a pervasive ordinariness in the setting. Little about it conveys the enormity of the assassination and its aftermath: the major European powers and their allies \u2014 Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and the Hapsburg and Ottoman Empires \u2014 marching in lock step into war.In the centenary commemorations in Sarajevo, culminating on Saturday with a concert in the old city hall, peace is the official theme. But the ethnic and nationalist divisions that motivated Princip are anything but history in this part of the world, which was ravaged only two decades ago by bloody sectarian fighting and is even now the scene of dueling efforts to define Princip\u2019s legacy. As Europe diligently promotes an ideology of harmony, broad areas of the continent, the Middle East and elsewhere continue to struggle with versions of the destructive forces unleashed that day.\u201cTo me, what is happening across Bosnia today, and what is happening in many other parts of the world, is very much like the beginning of the 20th century,\u201d said Vera Katz, a scholar at the University of Sarajevo\u2019s History Institute. \u201cSeeing how some of our communities have made Princip into a mythical figure has made me think that we have hardly moved on at all.\u201dThe archducal couple were on their way to a civic reception in the yellow-and orange-banded city hall, an endowment of the Hapsburg era that borrowed from Moorish Spain, when the violence began, with a conspirator tossing a homemade bomb from a bridge over the Miljacka River. It bounced off the folded canopy of the archduke\u2019s car before exploding.What ensued stands as a monument to imperial folly and to the role of chance and mischance in history. Shortly before 11 a.m., the couple left the reception, deeply shaken by the bombing but determined to see the day\u2019s formalities through. With the archduke in a military tunic and helmet, and the duchess in a dress of white filigreed lace with a matching hat and parasol, they headed back along the lightly guarded Miljacka embankment \u2014 and, 500 yards on, to their fateful encounter with Princip.A mural at Andricgrad \u2014 a model village in Visegrad, Bosnia, based on old Serb traditions \u2014 depicts the archduke's assassin, Gavrilo Princip, and his fellow conspirators.The sepia photographs in glass cases at the museum show Princip as a slight, whispery-mustached man with staring eyes, otherwise forgettable in his homespun jacket and collarless shirt. Raised in a poor family in northwest Bosnia, he was one of a group of Serbian conspirators \u2014 members of a revolutionary nationalist group, Young Bosnia \u2014 lurking among the cheering crowds.He told the Sarajevo court empaneled hastily to try him and his fellow conspirators that he had lost hope of killing the couple and retreated into a corner delicatessen, now the museum. But then a wrong turn by the archduke\u2019s driver and the lack of a reverse gear forced security men to push the car out of the narrow street, presenting Princip his victims at close range.A century later, Bosnia\u2019s Serbs, Muslims and Croats remain deeply divided in their attitudes toward Princip. Many Serbs view him as a heroic fighter against Austro-Hungarian rule \u2014 on behalf of Serbs first, but also, they say, on behalf of Croats and Muslims \u2014 and thus as an early standard-bearer for the South Slav kingdom of Yugoslavia, which emerged from the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and disintegrated amid the resurgent nationalist and sectarian passions of the 1990s.Among the largely Catholic Croats and some Bosnian Muslims, many of whom looked to the authorities in Vienna at the time of the assassination for protection against Balkan domination by the mainly Orthodox Serbs, it is more common to condemn Princip as an anarchist or terrorist, as the Sarajevo court did when it sentenced him to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. He died of tuberculosis, proud and unrepentant, in a prison in Terezin, now part of the Czech Republic, in 1918.Inevitably, the ghost of Princip has been exhumed as part of the newly embittered debate. It has been only a few years since he found a peace of his own in St. Mark Cemetery in the heart of Sarajevo, where a mausoleum built for him and 10 of his fellow conspirators under Yugoslav rule was desecrated in the 1990s, then restored by the Serbian Orthodox keepers of the cemetery.The concert, which will be broadcast live in 40 countries, is the centerpiece of a two-week program of conferences, concerts, poetry readings, plays and sporting performances whose organizers are determined not to take sides in the Princip dispute.The commemorations \u2014 sponsored by France and Austria, along with other European governments and $2.5 million from the European Union \u2014 have involved an element of historical amnesia. In 1914, France was, with Russia, the closest ally of Serbia: the newly independent nation that Princip saw as the linchpin of a new order in the Balkans, one that would unite all Balkan Serbs in a \u201cgreater Serbia\u201d once the colonial hold of the Austro-Hungarians and the Ottomans had been broken.Modern-day Austria and Hungary, with their strong historical sympathies for the murdered couple, emerged from the breakup of the Hapsburg empire codified by the Treaty of Versailles, which reset the map of Europe and the Middle East after World War I.That accord, which ended the 1990s blood bath, gave Bosnia a multilayered political structure, with more than a dozen governmental and parliamentary bodies \u2014 all elected on sectarian lines, and all now tottering under the weight of endemic corruption and fierce personal rivalries.To a reporter returning to Sarajevo for the first time since the siege of the early 1990s, the evidence of a new beginning is palpable. Even in driving rain, bars and restaurants are packed past midnight, laughter seems contagious, and joy at the achievement of the Bosnian soccer team in reaching the World Cup in Brazil seems boundless \u2014 and not only among Muslims and Croats, whose communities account for a majority of the players. When shells and mortars were falling in the 1990s and Serb artillery batteries were targeting bread and water lines, hospitals and schools, it seemed chimerical to think the city would ever prosper again.Against this, there are the unresolved animosities among sectarian hard-liners, including some who are involved in the parallel centenary commemorations. Among them is the Sarajevo-born film director Emir Kusturica, 59, who is of Muslim descent but converted to Serbian Orthodoxy after the turmoil of the 1990s. He is the driving force behind ceremonies honoring Princip that will be held on a peninsula jutting into the Drina River at Visegrad, about 70 miles from Sarajevo on the border between Bosnia and Serbia.Visegrad, whose population was once two-thirds Muslim, is overwhelmingly Serb now. It suffered some of the worst Serb atrocities, including mass rapes and incinerations of whole families locked into burning homes, in the first months of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in eastern Bosnia in 1992. As part of a bid to regenerate the town, Mr. Kusturica has overseen the construction of a $20 million model village, Andricgrad, based on old Serb traditions. It is there that the most elaborate ceremonies for Princip will be held, in the presence of leaders from Serbia.Mr. Kusturica\u2019s case for Princip is that political assassinations have been common drivers of history, and that Westerners who condemn Princip but supported the hanging of Saddam Hussein or the mob killing of Muammar el-Qaddafi are hypocrites.\u201cGavrilo Princip was our national pride, a revolutionary who helped us to get rid of slavery,\u201d he told visitors from Sarajevo as some 200 workers hastened about under a mosaic of Princip and his fellow conspirators, putting the final touches on the village. \u201cBosnia and Herzegovina was the last European colony on Slav soil, and what he did on June 28, 1914, was a blow for our liberation.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the location of the prison in which Gavrilo Princip, who killed the archduke and his consort, Sophie, died. It was in Terezin, in what is now the Czech Republic, not in a \u201cHungarian prison.\u201dA map with an article on June 28 about conflicting interpretations of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo as the city marked the 100th anniversary of that event misrepresented the eastern boundary of Turkey in 1924. The map did not include boundary changes established in 1923 under the Treaty of Lausanne, which recognized the modern state of Turkey.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deep Cover: Alice Goffman\u2019s \u2018On the Run\u2019", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cOn the Run\u201d is, first and foremost, a remarkable feat of reporting. Its author, Alice Goffman, a young sociologist, had an ethnography assignment for an undergraduate class at the University of Pennsylvania, and she, the daughter of the renowned sociologist Erving Goffman (1922-82), didn\u2019t take it lightly. She hung out with an older African-American food service worker at the university, and one thing led to another. Before long, she had moved into an apartment in a poor, largely black neighborhood in Philadelphia, her housemate a young man whose family lived down the block. Goffman became such a part of the fabric of the community that she was harassed by the police, witnessed someone getting pistol-whipped, was even set up on a blind date. And all the while she was furiously taking notes, trying to make sense of what at first glance appeared to be utter chaos going on around her. But where others might see bedlam, Goffman finds patterns, even logic. When it becomes clear that many of the young men won\u2019t go to the public hospital for treatment \u2014 she recounts watching one of them prone on his kitchen table, having a bullet removed from his thigh by a neighbor who is a nurse\u2019s aide \u2014 Goffman begins to ask questions and learns that the police often loiter near the emergency room, scanning the visitors list, looking to arrest anyone who might have an outstanding warrant. This could be a metaphor for what Goffman comes to realize: The young men in this community feel hunted. Their mental energy is spent trying to elude the police, so much so that they impart words of advice to younger siblings, including this from a man Goffman calls Chuck, speaking to his 12-year-old brother: \u201cYou hear them coming, that\u2019s it, you gone. Period. \u2019Cause whoever they looking for, even if it\u2019s not you, nine times out of 10 they\u2019ll probably book you.\u201d Chuck\u2019s warnings, it becomes clear, have merit. In fact, Chuck\u2019s brother receives three years\u2019 probation when he\u2019s given a ride to school in what turns out to be a stolen car. Many of the men Goffman encounters have recently been released from prison and are on parole. And as she points out, our parole and probation system is set up for people to fail. She introduces us to Alex, whose parole stipulations forbid him to visit his old neighborhood or be out past curfew. It\u2019s as if the system is just waiting for his first misstep, ready to pounce.\u201cOn the Run\u201d serves as a kind of coda to our war on drugs, an effort whose very rhetoric suggested it was us against them. The criminal justice system became a kind of invading force, aimed mostly at young black men. There was, of course, the inexplicable sentencing disparity between those caught with powdered cocaine and those caught with crack cocaine. States were emboldened to be equally punitive.In Illinois, for instance, the Legislature passed a law that automatically transferred a juvenile to adult court if caught with drugs within 1,000 feet of a public housing complex \u2014 a law clearly directed at African-American teenagers. The war on drugs mangled, if not destroyed, any trust between residents of distressed urban communities and the authorities. And when we speak of the authorities, it\u2019s the police who on a day-to-day basis must contend with the rubble left behind from more than two decades of disturbingly misguided public policy. Goffman describes how \u201ca climate of fear and suspicion pervades everyday life,\u201d with the result that \u201ca new social fabric is emerging under the threat of confinement: one woven in suspicion, distrust and the paranoiac practices of secrecy, evasion and unpredictability.\u201d To her credit, she didn\u2019t set out with this notion; rather, it\u2019s where she landed after six years of up-close observation. Goffman spent her time in a Philadelphia community she calls 6th Street, which consists of a commercial strip and five residential blocks. There she came to know the locals intimately, not only the young men but also their girlfriends and families. She became so embedded in the community that she witnessed 24 police raids, including one in which she herself was handcuffed. Her guide is a man in his 20s she calls Mike (Goffman changed everyone\u2019s name), who introduces her to friends as his adopted sister. Mike has a low-paying warehouse job and supplements his income by selling crack, getting in and out of trouble with the law. Like the others we meet, he\u2019s neither hero nor villain. He\u2019s simply trying to get by. The level of detail in this book and Goffman\u2019s ability to understand her subjects\u2019 motivations are astonishing \u2014 and riveting. Indeed, it\u2019s a power of \u201cOn the Run\u201d that her insights and conclusions feel so honest to what she\u2019s seen and heard. She depicts a community where trust has evaporated, where young men like Mike often avoid girlfriends for fear that the women, for their own reasons, might turn their paramours in. And she describes an underground economy that has sprung up around what she calls the fugitive life, including entrepreneurs who sell their clean urine to those on parole. (One entrepreneur jokes that his trade encourages him to stay clean: \u201cIf you sell one dirty bag, you\u2019re done.\u201d) More than anything, Goffman helps us understand why residents of this neighborhood make the seemingly cockeyed choices they do, often for very rational reasons, often because they know well the repercussions of the alternative. She learns that many refuse to call the police not because of a cultural aversion to \u201csnitching,\u201d but because they fear it will only expose them, especially if they\u2019re on parole or have an outstanding warrant. You can\u2019t read this book without a growing sense of understanding as well as outrage. Still, Goffman is an ethnographer, not a storyteller, and it\u2019s challenging to keep track of the large cast of characters. I often wished that she had given us more to hold on to, that she had let us get to know some of her subjects in all their fullness and richness. Because she\u2019s so focused on their relationship to the law, we don\u2019t learn much else about them. Their interests. Their aspirations. Even just their quirks and idiosyncrasies. They undoubtedly have more dimensions than Goffman allows them in these pages.There\u2019s been a good deal of buzz about this book, in large part because of the reporting techniques, a kind of \u00fcber-version of immersion journalism. And it\u2019s these techniques that make \u201cOn the Run\u201d both exciting and troublesome. In a 50-page appendix titled \u201cA Methodological Note\u201d that is as compelling as the body of the book, Goffman lays out her reporting approach. It will leave many shaking their heads, both with admiration and uneasiness. As I mentioned, Goffman ended up living in the community, and her housemate, Mike, and his two friends who regularly crash at the house are the book\u2019s main characters. Goffman becomes so much a part of their lives that she starts to be a participant as well as an observer. She talks about cutting herself off from her previous friends, of restricting herself to only the media Mike\u2019s group indulged in, which was mostly hip-hop, R&B and gangster movies. \u201cAfter spending a few months with Mike and his friends,\u201d she writes, \u201cI moved even further away from their ideals of beauty or femininity, in part as a strategy to conduct the fieldwork, and in part because I was, as a participant observer, adopting their male attitudes, dress, habits and even language.\u201d This made me squirm. Something feels calculating here. I\u2019ve spent a good deal of time in similar communities (though unlike Goffman, I\u2019ve never moved in), and I\u2019ve always felt it was best to be myself, to acknowledge the differences. I have to admit I write this criticism with both awe and discomfort. Could she have had this same access if she remained true to who she is? Goffman may disagree, but I think she could have. There\u2019s something more disquieting, though. Goffman at times makes rather sweeping statements or offers up the occasional anecdote, mostly relating to law enforcement, without an indication of the source. At one point, she asserts that \u201cthe police typically take whatever cash they find\u201d during drug raids. On another occasion, she writes of an F.B.I. agent who, in an effort to track people with warrants, supposedly developed a computer program inspired by the Stasi, the East German secret police. Nowhere does she tell us where she got such information. But what I suspect will be most debated, especially among ethnographers and journalists, are ethical questions raised by Goffman\u2019s status as a participant observer. She witnesses a number of beatings and, by my count, two murders, one at the hands of a young man she was following, the other at the hands of a police officer. In a recent interview with Philly.com, Goffman mentions that she destroyed all her field notes so that they couldn\u2019t be subpoenaed. That seems to answer a practical question, but not the moral one. I should be the last to pass judgment, given incidents I\u2019ve seen and heard. I\u2019ll also concede that I\u2019ve never witnessed something as profoundly disturbing as a murder, and if I did, I suppose under certain circumstances, especially if I feared for my or my family\u2019s safety, I might be torn about coming forward. But I wish Goffman addressed this dilemma head-on, especially because enduring such regular acts of brutality undoubtedly weighs on the souls of those like Mike and his friends.Ultimately, what Goffman experienced living alongside these men is both revelatory and sobering. The question we now need to ask is clear: How do we emerge from the wreckage left by a public policy that posited young black men as the enemy? As a guard at a halfway house tells Goffman: \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy. It\u2019s a crime against God. Sometimes I think, in 50 years we are going to look back on this and, you know. . . . This was wrong.\u201d ON THE RUNFugitive Life in an American CityBy Alice Goffman277 pp. The University of Chicago Press. $25.Alex Kotlowitz is a writer in residence at Northwestern University and the author of three books, including \u201cThere Are No Children Here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Reasons for Those Low Interest Rates", "Date": "2014-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 Why are interest rates so low? And how long will they stay that way?  With the European Central Bank\u2019s passing another historic milestone by imposing negative interest rates on a major part of the world economy, there is one obvious explanation for the unprecedented collapse of interest rates that everyone can agree on. Central banks can set money market interest rates as low or as high as they please, simply by supplying to commercial banks whatever amount of excess credit is needed to keep these rates at the chosen level. The E.C.B. set its deposit rate Thursday at minus 0.10 percent, effectively meaning it is charging interest to banks to store their money at the central bank.For the five years since early 2009, central bankers all over the world have decided, rightly or wrongly, that interest rates should be at or near historic lows. Moreover, they have made it very clear that they will continue to squeeze interest rates down to near zero, or even negative, levels until next year and perhaps beyond. But this obvious explanation of the interest rate conundrum leads to a much more interesting question: What accounts for the rock-bottom levels not only of the overnight interest rates that central banks set directly, but also of the long-term rates that depend on the willingness of pension funds, insurers and investors to tie up their savings for 10 years or more in government bonds?If investors were absolutely confident that short-term rates set by the central banks would remain near zero for many years, then the seemingly paltry returns, varying from 0.6 percent to 2.6 percent, on 10-year bonds issued by the European, Japanese and United States governments would seem quite generous \u2014 and rational investors would be happy to lock up their money for a decade at these rates. But why are investors as confident about the persistence of near-zero interest rates, as the low bond yields of today seem to imply? There are two possible answers, reflecting diametrically opposite economic views. The pessimistic view is that the world economy since the 2008 financial crisis has settled into a \u201cnew normal\u201d of very weak growth and negligible inflation or even falling prices. Proponents of the new normal agree that central banks will keep interest rates near zero for most of the next decade and therefore that today\u2019s historically low bond yields will offer investors much higher incomes than they will be able to secure in future years. But much of the recent evidence from the world economy and financial markets has contradicted this grim view. Economic statistics now mostly point to accelerating growth in America, Britain and Germany and at least a stabilization of the economic slowdowns in China, Europe and Japan. Inflation is also picking up in America, Britain and Japan. Meanwhile, in financial markets, equities are hitting all-time records and industrial commodities are rising. In short, the equity and commodity markets contradict the economic messages from the bond market, and they cannot both be right \u2014 which brings us to the alternative explanation for rock-bottom bond yields: Bond markets may simply be unhinged from economic reality. This could be happening for four technical reasons. First, very aggressive central bank policies in Europe and Japan, where deflation and stagnation are still genuine dangers, have artificially depressed bond yields in Britain and the United States, despite the economic acceleration evident in these countries.For German and Japanese investors, whose governments pay only 1.4 percent and 0.6 percent respectively on 10-year bonds, a United States yield of 2.6 percent really does look generous, especially when the currency risks can be hedged at almost zero cost. Second, low bond yields everywhere have been exaggerated by regulatory distortions. Pension and insurance funds have had to guarantee their long-term obligations by buying \u201crisk-free\u201d government bonds, despite the very low prospective returns on these investments. Banks have been encouraged to \u201cde-risk\u201d by regulations that favor loans to governments rather than private companies and households. Third, we must ask why prudent regulators would want to force-feed financial institutions with bonds whose \u201crisk-free returns\u201d are now so meager that these investments now amount to a \u201creturn-free risk.\u201d A plausible answer is suggested by the history of postwar governments\u2019 relieving themselves of wartime debts with regulations that forced savings into low-yielding long-term bonds, whose value was then whittled away by inflation. Governments must surely be tempted to repeat this process if bond market conditions allow \u2014 which brings us to the final bond-market distortion.Since 1981, when short-term interest rates in the United States peaked at 20 percent, government bond yields have fallen continuously, albeit with occasional countertrend interruptions, as memories of the great inflation of the 1970s have faded away. During this 30-year period, investors who believed government promises of ever-lower inflation and structurally declining interest rates consistently made money. Meanwhile, the \u201cbond market vigilantes\u201d who used to dominate investment thinking in the 1980s, warning constantly against politicians who try to renege through inflation on their debts, have gradually lost their jobs.  Many of the survivors who now dominate bond investment tend to assume that the bull market they have enjoyed since 1981 will keep going.What these bond bulls have failed to notice is that the 30-year trend of rising bond prices (and the corresponding decline in long-term interest rates) probably ended in 2012. Since July 2012, the peaks and troughs in long-term interest rates in America have been gradually rising, not falling. And the prospects for inflation and growth suggest that this trend of rising long-term rates will probably continue for many years ahead.If so, then investors who buy bonds at today\u2019s low yields will be big losers, while governments that issue, and then inflate away, these low-return obligations will rejoice.

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ...Mykonos, Greece", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateThe property is on the southeastern coast of Mykonos, one of the Cyclades Islands in the Aegean.A TRADITIONAL ISLAND VILLA ON THE SOUTHEASTERN COAST$3.97 MILLION (2.9 MILLION EUROS) The main villa is earthquake-resistant, Mr. Mugni said. To accomplish that goal, the foundation and walls are reinforced concrete and brick that have been finished with stucco.On the first floor are a living room, a dining area with a fireplace, a kitchen with electric range and a study. An en-suite master bedroom has a terrace with views over the Aegean Sea. Another en-suite bedroom is on the second floor.The cottage, set in a grove of olive trees, is reached by a wooden walkway, and has one en-suite bedroom, as does the guest apartment. The cottage next to the heated pool has a double bed; a hammam, or steam room; and gym equipment.The property is about five minutes\u2019 drive to Lia, the nearest beach; amenities, including shopping and tavernas, are in the town of Ano Mera, which is 10 minutes by car. Mykonos airport, with flights to many European cities, is 20 minutes away. The town of Mykonos, with its night life and world-class restaurants, is about 25 minutes\u2019 drive.MARKET OVERVIEWThe international jet-set appeal of Mykonos has helped the island escape some of Greece\u2019s economic woes. Prices have fallen since 2008, real estate agents said, but sales never completely stopped, and a new wave of buyers from the Middle East has helped compensate for the loss of the Greek market.Buyers can find smaller villas on the west coast with lesser views, or properties on the northern and southern coasts, for $2.5 million to about $5 million, agents said. Below that price range, the best properties tend to be part of a cluster of three or four villas that share a common outdoor space with a swimming pool.Those prices might be as much as 40 percent lower than before the European recession started in 2008, agents said, but the drop appears to have been arrested in the last two years.Ms. Deldimou sounded similarly optimistic. \u201cLast year was the best year in the last five years at least. This year is promising,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will start to affect the prices, lead them a little higher, but not something dramatic, I think.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI think the government has proved to be resilient,\u201d Mr. Ploumis said. \u201cThe fear that Greece would leave the euro zone has passed. Perhaps the real economy and people have not felt it yet, but it\u2019s very much in the air.\u201dWHO BUYS ON MYKONOS\u201cIn the past few years we have worked exclusively with the foreign market,\u201d Mr. Ploumis said. European buyers tend to come from Britain, France, Germany and Italy, he said, with a sizable contingent of Americans, many with Greek ancestors.In recent years, agents said, Mykonos has become popular with buyers from the Middle East \u2014 in particular Egypt, Israel and Lebanon \u2014 who are looking for an escape from the region\u2019s turmoil. \u201cThere is uncertainty in their countries,\u201d Ms. Deldimou said. \u201cFor all these people, it is quite easy to be here. It\u2019s more or less the same climate: the sea, the sun.\u201dShe said buyers are looking both for a vacation home for themselves, and to take advantage of Mykonos\u2019s strong rental market. \u201cThey always consider the income they are going to have from the property they are going to buy, which is really good.\u201dBUYING BASICSThere are few restrictions on foreign buyers, agents said. Ms. Deldimou said buyers need to secure a Greek bank account and obtain a tax identification number, a process she described as \u201cvery simple.\u201dAll transactions are handled by a notary, who processes the paperwork and ensures that taxes are paid. While a lawyer is not necessary, agents strongly advised that buyers retain one.Prospective buyers should budget 5 percent to 7 percent over the selling price for taxes and fees, agents said. Costs include a transfer tax, which was lowered to 3 percent from 10 percent as of\u00a0Jan. 1; notary and lawyer fees of about 1.5 percent each; and commission to a buyers\u2019 agent \u2014 if one is being used \u2014 of about 2 percent.WEBSITESLANGUAGE AND CURRENCY Greek; euro (1 euro = $1.37)TAXES AND FEESAnnual property taxes are about $1,400, Mr. Mugni said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

He salvaged the office detritus in order to play around with a dream he\u2019d had, in which one of the actors in the company was bombarded by paper from a rampaging copier. But he soon found himself equally taken with what he calls \u201ca story Hollywood could not have written\u201d: the remarkable saga of how Shackleton persevered through setback after setback when his ship, the aptly named Endurance, became trapped in pack ice shortly after making for Antarctica in December 1914. He and his entire 27-man crew survived the loss of their ship and 22 months of brutal weather and harsh deprivation. He thought there might be a theater piece in comparing such people with \u201cthe 21st-century man who gets really upset when someone cuts him off in traffic.\u201d Another aspect of the story that appealed to him was Shackleton\u2019s indomitable good cheer. \u201cI\u2019m not an optimist,\u201d Mr. Webster noted. \u201cHe was always trying to find a way to stay on the bright side of life, to keep his men moving and hopeful. I wanted to examine this and maybe hopefully improve from a glass-half-empty to a glass-half-full guy.\u201d Such work dispenses with not just ready-made scripts, but also elaborate sets and realistic costumes; it asks, Mr. Webster said, \u201cWhat can we do with what we have?\u201dIn \u201cEndurance,\u201d Mr. Webster alternates between portraying a disgruntled insurance adjuster and playing the intrepid Shackleton without ever changing out of his business suit \u2014 he just puts on a broad-brimmed safari hat. \u201cWe\u2019re very facile at using objects,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can a desk suddenly become an iceberg? What happens when we turn it on its side? We start moving with the objects to see what they will tell us.\u201d The setting for \u201cEndurance\u201d became a foundering insurance company, where one Walter Spivey is put in charge of clearing thousands of claims with a tiny, demoralized staff. \u201cIn the course of the play, by studying Shackleton, Walter Spivey learns how to lead,\u201d Mr. Webster said. The play\u2019s New Haven run has been preceded by performances around the world, sometimes for theatergoers and sometimes for business executives. A consultant who saw \u201cEndurance\u201d decided that its leadership lessons could be of use to her clients, and Split Knuckle has since developed a lucrative sideline in corporate training. \u201cThe checks we get from corporations,\u201d Mr. Webster noted with a chuckle, \u201care not like the checks we get from theaters.\u201d They will help subsidize the company\u2019s next expeditions into unknown theatrical territory.

Witness the way they shook Washington on Tuesday by removing from power Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, who had been one of the most implacable opponents to the reform of immigration, health care and taxation. His crime (in addition to complacent campaigning)? He was occasionally obliged, as a leader, to take a few minimalist steps toward governing, like raising the debt ceiling and ending a ruinous shutdown.For that he was pilloried in his Virginia district by a little-known resident of the distant extremes, David Brat, whose most effective campaign tool was a photo showing Mr. Cantor standing next to President Obama. By falsely portraying the seven-term incumbent as just another compromiser, just another accommodationist to the power of big government, Mr. Brat managed the unimaginable feat of bringing down a majority leader in a primary, and by double digits.Mr. Cantor did vote repeatedly to raise the debt ceiling, as Mr. Brat likes to point out in his most irresponsible smear. But Mr. Cantor is better remembered as the leader who, along with Mr. Boehner, openly encouraged the House Tea Party class of 2010 to begin a series of high-stakes debt standoffs with the White House that nearly plunged the country over the brink of default. Having unleashed the most destructive political impulses of his party, he finally fell victim to them.Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who won his primary on Tuesday, supports immigration reform but placated conservatives by regularly going on talk shows to bash Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign policy and suggest the possibility of impeachment.Mr. Brat will probably go to Congress next year, joining Republicans like these who will face a momentous choice for their party. Now that Mr. Cantor has agreed to step down, will he and other members of the leadership be replaced by even more divisive politicians determined to stage confrontations with the president at every juncture? Will they continue to ignore a stagnating economy, inadequate education and decaying cities? If they do, they will create an opening for Democrats.

{"Headline": "They Love Paris", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCole Porter isn\u2019t the only American to have fallen in love with Paris in the springtime, which may explain why four books about Europe\u2019s most beguiling city have appeared all at once. By pure serendipity, their four authors have independently succeeded in producing a chronological quartet.Wittily written and impeccably researched, Joan DeJean\u2019s \u201cHow Paris Became Paris\u201d unpacks the cherished belief that Baron Haussmann masterminded the modern Paris we know and love. In fact, as DeJean nimbly demonstrates, the city\u2019s postcard-perfect charm owes much to the vision of two savvy monarchs: Henri IV and his grandson, Louis XIV, the Sun King. By the time an admiring Peter the Great paid a visit in 1717, looking for inspiration for his own dream city, St. Petersburg, Paris was the only place to go to pilfer good ideas.Henri\u2019s second grand project was to present Paris with its first planned square. His scheme to subsidize the Place Royale as a center for silk manufacture failed. Completed, nevertheless, within a brisk 18 months, the Place des Vosges (its modern name) was constructed to a uniform design and intended as an arena for leisurely promenades. Vaulted arcades provided protection against inclement weather, while the empty central space, capable of holding 60,000 at a squeeze, provided the modestly housed citizens of the Marais with the equivalent of an immense outdoor living room. Still considered one of the glories of Paris, Henri\u2019s square of rose-red houses was copied in Madrid (the Plaza Mayor), in London\u2019s Covent Garden and, after Peter\u2019s 1717 visit, in St. Petersburg.Henri IV was murdered before he had the chance to complete his crowning gift to the city he adored: the transformation of two scrubby river islets into a single lozenge-shaped plot of land. The \u00cele Saint-Louis remains a tranquil haven in the heart of Paris. Shored up by stone piles and linked to the mainland by handsome bridges, the island featured elegant homes (almost all designed by a single inspired architect, Louis Le Vau) that were acquired by a new social group, the oppressively rich financiers who made their fortunes by bankrolling the king\u2019s battles. It was this same group that, fearful of trouble from the urban poor, prudently shifted their personal power base to an elegant gated community of residential palaces that had been strategically perched out on the edge of town, offering such upright citizens the luxury of a swift escape in times of trouble.Hubristically to be named at first the Square of Our Conquests, the financiers\u2019 grand refuge (only their own architects could afford to share it with them) is better known today as Place Vend\u00f4me. It represented the last arrogant hurrah of a reign during which King Louis transformed Paris into a lantern-lit City of Light, where visitors could stroll through a new public garden (the Tuileries), purchase the luxury goods around which the French economy had created a booming export trade and post letters at every main street, and \u2014 a novelty that delighted the sociable Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 \u2014 in which a respectable woman could enjoy the urban night.Already dazzling in 1700, Paris would seem to have reached its apotheosis by 1900, when a ruinously extravagant world\u2019s fair showed off a glittering Palace of Electricity, an extravaganza lit by 5,000 incandescent bulbs and topped by a flaming chariot. In a splendid previous work, \u201cDawn of the Belle Epoque,\u201d Mary McAuliffe strikingly evoked the three flourishing decades of culture that followed France\u2019s humiliation by Germany and the never-to-be-forgotten crowning, in 1871, of a German emperor at Versailles. Now, in \u201cTwilight of the Belle Epoque,\u201d this brilliant social historian applies her novelistic approach with equal success to the early 20th century, interweaving a multitude of stories to create \u2014 through skillfully chosen glimpses into the lives of its most talented inhabitants \u2014 an unforgettable portrait of Paris.McAuliffe\u2019s cast is large and unruly, but she choreographs their entrances and exits with the deceptively effortless panache of that prince among impresarios (and a significant contributor to her story) Serge Diaghilev. Ravel tickles the ivories for Isadora Duncan; Monet stands shoulder to shoulder with Henry James (whom he finds very kind) to observe the funeral procession of Queen Victoria in London. Back in Paris, a schoolboy Charles de Gaulle is mesmerized in 1900 by a 56-year-old Sarah Bernhardt, spryly undertaking the role of Napoleon\u2019s youthful heir in Edmond Rostand\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Aiglon.\u201d A courageous Marcel Proust gives a party for 60 pro- and anti-Dreyfusards and awaits the din of shouts and smashing china. (Nothing happens.) Dreyfus sits guard over the coffin of his fiercest defender, \u00c9mile Zola, while an anti-Semitic roofer confesses to his part in the great novelist\u2019s death by carbon monoxide poisoning. (He had deliberately blocked up the chimney of the firelit bedroom in which Zola and his wife lay sleeping.) Isadora Duncan\u2019s friend Mary Desti reveals that Isadora\u2019s celebrated barefoot dances began as an inspired escape, one intoxicating night, from performing in whisky-sodden sandals. Isadora\u2019s viciously egocentric lover, Edward Gordon Craig, tells her to call their baby \u201canything you damn please \u2014 Sophocles if you like,\u201d while sending her earnings off to his English mistress.And onward, seamlessly, the pageant of events flows beside the Seine. A beady-eyed Sarah Bernhardt watches a teenage Jean Cocteau strut into a costume ball dressed as the Emperor Heliogabalus. She passes him an icy note: \u201cIf I were your mother, I\u2019d send you to bed.\u201d Cocteau ignores it. Diaghilev urges a deflated Cocteau to become even more extraordinary: \u201cAstound me!\u201d Paul Poiret, hosting a Scheherazade-themed ball to show off his exquisite and expensive fashion wares, states with exquisite hypocrisy that he has never believed in \u201cthe virtue of advertisement.\u201d Count Harry Kessler, a diminutive Anglo-German Francophile, watches a dirigible float through the silent sky above Paris and compares it to an immense yellow whale. Presciently, Kessler notes \u201ca strange feeling of a new era.\u201d It\u2019s 1907.Deftly, McAuliffe gathers together the threads of her multiple tales for the arrival of that ultimate rite: war. Here, to her readers\u2019 possible surprise, the artists and inventors emerge as heroes. Marie Curie teaches herself to drive and mend a car while she and her daughter set up X\u2011ray units close to the combat line. Dreyfus serves with honor at the front. Cocteau, niftily kitted out by Poiret, performs his patriotic duty. Isadora, drunk, overweight and back from a disastrous show in New York, wins applause in Paris for an impassioned dance rendition of \u201cThe Marseillaise.\u201d Sarah Bernhardt, undaunted by a recently amputated leg, dazzles the troops before embarking on a 99-city tour of the United States. And Cocteau, at long last, succeeds in astounding Diaghilev in 1917 with \u201cParade,\u201d an avant-garde show with music by Satie and sets and costumes by Picasso. The opening night is a riotous, showstopping fiasco. Cocteau\u2019s name is made.By 1918, Parisian life has grown a lot bleaker. Thirty German planes drop 144 bombs on the city in a single terrifying night. Germany\u2019s Paris Gun, firing from 75 miles away, wipes out much of a congregation of churchgoers and continues to intimidate citizens for an agonizing further five months. Proust saunters back to his cork-lined room in a hat peppered with shrapnel. He says mice frighten him, but bombs don\u2019t. Dreyfus, after 14 months at the front, finds himself laden with tributes. The pioneering filmmaker Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, on the other hand, is forced to surrender his precious reels for their silver content. Ruined, he retires to run a toy shop in the Gare Montparnasse.Cocteau pops up once again in John Baxter\u2019s engaging and mildly peculiar \u201cParis at the End of the World,\u201d part cultural history, part family memoir. Archie Baxter, the author\u2019s Australian grandfather, arrived in the United Kingdom as a volunteer, at the end of 1916. His war was not rich in incident. Varicose veins debarred him from active duty. But in October 1917, Archie made it across the Channel to Le Havre.Almost as mysterious as Archie\u2019s adventures is the identity of John Baxter\u2019s research adviser, a London editor who has, we are assured, served three years in prison for murdering his wife (or perhaps mistress). Baxter is thrilled by the criminal connection. \u201cWe solemnly shook hands. With that very hand. . . . \u201d Lady Macbeth drops into the story to whisper a warning in the author\u2019s ear. \u201cWho would have thought the old man had so much blood in him?\u201d Affable and disappointingly mundane, the researcher does his best to uncover Archie\u2019s secrets. None emerge. It\u2019s a very odd book.Tilar J. Mazzeo specializes in the history of luxury brands: Veuve Clicquot Champagne, Chanel No. 5 and now \u2014 in \u201cThe Hotel on Place Vend\u00f4me\u201d \u2014 the Ritz.Once the haunt of the Dreyfusards, the Ritz became notoriously \u201cJanus-faced\u201d during the four unhappy years when a swastika flew from the Eiffel Tower. German grandees occupied the part of the hotel that faces the Rue Vend\u00f4me. Hermann Goering took a deluxe suite at a 90 percent discount (he sent the bill to Vichy). The Rue Cambon side of the hotel remained staunchly French, offering a refuge to members of the Resistance and even \u2014 thanks to the gallant efforts of one Ritz employee \u2014 signaling Allied planes from its kitchen windows.Mazzeo\u2019s narrative focuses on the Liberation, and on the desperate endeavors of Ernest Hemingway to ensure that he \u2014 and nobody else \u2014 got the credit for liberating Paris\u2019s most celebrated hotel. Tongue nicely in cheek, Mazzeo reports how, having greeted the manager, Hemingway dismissed his rivals (the British had already chosen it for their headquarters) with a roar of Germanic bluster. Amazingly, it worked. Hemingway \u2014 having liberated both the cellars and a grateful Simone de Beauvoir \u2014 bounced off to liberate his favorite American bookshop and then returned to enjoy the Ritz\u2019s well-stocked wine vaults.Factually, Mazzeo\u2019s history is sometimes perched upon a pair of toothpick-thin stilts. (Her source for a ramshackle account of the Duke of Windsor\u2019s fantasies about seizing the throne from his brother turns out to be a single, dubious newspaper article, published some five years ago.) Her book is, nevertheless, extremely jolly. It should provide the perfect gift for anybody flush enough \u2014 the Ritz, soon to be reopened, has remained one of Paris\u2019s most expensive hotels \u2014 to book a weekend in the \u201cimperial suite\u201d that was once occupied by Goering, and in which, more than 50 years later, the former Princess of Wales and Dodi al-Fayed would enjoy their suitably glamorous last supper.HOW PARIS BECAME PARISThe Invention of the Modern CityBy Joan DeJeanIllustrated. 307 pp. Bloomsbury. $30.TWILIGHT OF THE BELLE EPOQUEThe Paris of Picasso, Stravinsky, Proust, Renault, Marie Curie, Gertrude Stein, and Their Friends Through the Great WarBy Mary McAuliffeIllustrated. 417 pp. Rowman & Littlefield. $29.95.PARIS AT THE END OF THE WORLDThe City of Light During the Great War, 1914-1918By John BaxterIllustrated. 402 pp. Harper Perennial.

{"Headline": "Faces of an Immigration System Overwhelmed by Women and Children", "Date": "2014-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN ANTONIO \u2014 This is what it looks like when an immigration system is overwhelmed by tens of thousands of women and children from Central America. In an emergency shelter for unaccompanied children at Lackland Air Force Base here, on a concrete pad where troops would typically muster, roughly 100 teenage boys listened attentively on Thursday to a man who was preaching to them in their native Spanish.\u201cWe know that you are sad, that you are alone,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t look at the size of the problem. Look toward the solution.\u201d He went on: \u201cLet\u2019s defeat this giant!\u201dIn Phoenix, up to four buses a day arrive at the Greyhound station, each filled to capacity with women and children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. They crossed the border in Texas, but immigration officials sent them to Phoenix because the Texas facilities were overcrowded. Since Memorial Day weekend, about 1,000 women and children have been flown to Tucson from Texas, then driven by bus to Phoenix and dumped unceremoniously, weary and hungry, left to find their families scattered around the nation. Some minors will be housed at a naval base in California, and immigration officials are finding extra aircraft. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been ordered to coordinate efforts to contain the crisis.Crews of local volunteers have been greeting the migrants at the Phoenix bus station, indignant that immigration authorities are dropping them off with little more than bottles of water, apples and potato chips.\u201cThis is cruel,\u201d said Jorge Mendez, a volunteer at the Phoenix Restoration Project, a nonprofit group that helps immigrants settle. \u201cI understand that if they stayed in Texas, they could have been deported. But the first thing they say when they get off the bus is they are hungry.\u201dThese scenes are not only enraging local groups but also causing alarm among Border Patrol officials, who worry that American policy toward these migrants is a direct cause of their increased numbers. White House officials have said that criminal violence and ailing economies in Central America, not American border security, are the primary factors driving the wave. The unanticipated surge in migrants in recent weeks has created a political, practical and humanitarian crisis for the Obama administration. Conservative critics argue that the administration\u2019s enforcement of immigration law has sent encouraging signals to Central Americans, suggesting that they may enjoy a de facto amnesty if they get across the Mexico border.The numbers reached a new peak this week, Border Patrol officials said. On Wednesday, a single group of about 250 migrants, mostly women and children, was apprehended after crossing the Rio Grande near McAllen, Tex., said Raul Ortiz, deputy Border Patrol chief in the Rio Grande Valley. Mr. Ortiz said that about one-third of those caught in his sector were women traveling with young children. Families require special detention facilities, and the authorities have run out of space along the Texas border to hold them.Homeland Security officials are scrambling to find new detention facilities and to break up bottlenecks that have slowed deportations. Among border officials, concern is mounting that migrants, including unaccompanied minors, who have been released are spreading the word back to Central America and encouraging more to come. According to an internal draft Homeland Security document, officials recently revised their projections on unaccompanied minors. They now expect more than 90,000 in the 2014 fiscal year, an increase of nearly 20,000 from the previous projection. Frequent releases of migrants who have crossed the border illegally \u201cserve as incentives for additional individuals to follow the same path,\u201d the document said. Peter Boogaard, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said the draft was not official policy and had not been finalized or circulated. Chris Cabrera of the Border Patrol union in the Rio Grande Valley said officers were increasingly worried that the focus on children and families had diverted them from maintaining control at the border. \u201cSo much of our time and effort is being spent on family units and juveniles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are leaving the door open for others to come across.\u201d There are roughly 1,200 children in the shelter at Lackland Air Force Base because there was no room for them in immigration facilities along the border. Here, in clean, simple dorms usually used to house troops, the children, already checked for scabies and lice, had been served hearty American cafeteria food and given fresh white tube socks. But they had arrived without their parents \u2014 indeed, without much at all. And now that they were in American custody, it was not clear where they would end up next.Lackland\u2019s emergency shelter is one of two that the administration has established on military bases in recent weeks to handle the wave of unaccompanied immigrant children. The second is at Naval Base Ventura County in Oxnard, Calif. On Thursday, federal officials offered news organizations a restricted tour of the Lackland site. Reporters were not allowed to take photographs or to speak with children, to protect their privacy.Kimi Jackson, director of the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project in Harlingen, Tex., said that many children at the shelter should be considered eligible for asylum or other immigration relief because they were fleeing \u201cextreme violence\u201d in their home countries, or had been abused by their parents. Ms. Jackson\u2019s group tries to find pro bono lawyers for children who meet those criteria, but she said the demand almost always exceeded supply.Health and Human Services officials said that most children remained in the department\u2019s custody for about 35 days. By federal law, officials must try to pair the children with relatives living in the United States, so that they may live in a normal household environment while they wait for a resolution to their immigration proceedings. For any children exposed to the horrors Ms. Jackson described, the Lackland shelter, which the Health and Human Services Department set up last month, must have seemed like a welcome relief. On Thursday, it had an easygoing, summer-camp atmosphere: Dozens of staff members interacted with the children, preaching to them, teaching them basic English and tending to the sick. Peals of laughter could be heard emanating from a girls\u2019 dorm room. In another dorm, a group of girls sat in a circle on the floor, having what appeared to be a group heart-to-heart.There were also hints of the trauma they had survived while crossing the harrowing expanse of Mexico alone, and the trauma they were living through now. Hallways and cot-lined dorm rooms were adorned with the children\u2019s homemade inspirational posters. \u201cBe strong,\u201d one of them said. \u201cBe brave. Trust in God. He is great.\u201dRichard Fausset reported from San Antonio, and Ken Belson from Phoenix.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BY But savvy sports fans know to look past the obvious options. Unexpected twists can turn routine games into legendary matches and overlooked players into new superstars.  That\u2019s why, in an era when practically every play is statistically tracked, some fans are scanning those data for clues to a smarter call. Perhaps Brazil will be off its game, or Messi\u2019s golden boot will tarnish.  At trading desks and in newsrooms around the globe, market watchers face a similar challenge in evaluating Brazil\u2019s economic prospects.  It seems like a no-brainer, for example, that the makers of World Cup-related stuff \u2014 from TVs to beer to shoes \u2014 are likely to see sales rise regardless of the games\u2019 final victor.  Still, despite early optimism that the World Cup would give Brazil\u2019s economy a steep lift, sentiment has since turned negative.  Dig a bit deeper, though, and it turns out each of these examples offers a reminder that near-term consensus thinking can obscure long-term insights.  What, then, are the counter-intuitive signs of Brazil\u2019s economic prospects?  Yet history is not destiny. And quarterly metrics are a poor measure of the structural benefits that can flow from the spending surges associated with big sporting events. Economists reckon that investments in roads, public transit, and other infrastructure generate roughly $2 in additional GDP for every dollar invested.  These gains are notoriously slow to manifest, however, since it can take years for businesses and consumers to adjust \u2014 whether that means switching to freight-rail delivery thanks to new tracks or moving to a new home because of upgraded transit availability.  Trade is another, somewhat surprising, long-term beneficiary of welcoming worldwide sports competitions. Rose\u2019s NBER study found that within a decade or so of the event, hosts of the Olympics and the World Cup see long-term gains in total trade on the order of 30 percent. These high-profile international celebrations, he concludes, tend to be pivot points, after which governments turn away from closed, regulated economic policy toward more open, liberal trading regimes. Click to expand Brazil may not win 2014\u2019s World Cup, of course. And while losing would be a bitter disappointment, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a recipe for any long-term demise in soccer \u2014 or in the markets.  The first time Brazil hosted the games, in 1950, its team made it all the way to the final. More than 174,000 fans \u2014 the most in World Cup history \u2014 watched the match, which Brazil lost in the final minutes, to Uruguay, 2-1.  Instant analysis might have been dismissive of Brazil\u2019s future potential. Yet the trauma seemed to steel the nation\u2019s resolve. In its next two appearances in the finals, in 1958 and 1962, Brazil came from behind to triumph.  The takeaway? In sports, as well as in markets, short-term prognostications may not yield savviest bets. More disciplined training can produce winning teams. And deeper thinking can make it easier to ignore conventional wisdom and make smarter decisions. The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post&aposs preparation."}

But not so much now.\u201dPoland is still a warm haven of pro-American sentiments, as President Obama will no doubt feel when he revisits Warsaw on Tuesday. But after more than a decade in which Poland has shifted from a Washington-centric focus to an increasingly vigorous engagement in the European Union, the intensity of that love affair has diminished.\u201cThere is not a feeling of anti-Americanism in Poland,\u201d said Aleksander Smolar, president of the Stefan Batory Foundation, which promotes democracy and civic issues. \u201cI would rather speak about the temperature of feeling. It had been very high, but now the temperature is lower.\u201dEven Michael Mandelbaum, the Johns Hopkins University foreign policy expert who delivered the quip about Poland, agrees that the country President Obama will encounter is not the same one he described.\u201cThe national focus shifted from international politics and security to economics,\u201d Mr. Mandelbaum wrote in an email last week. \u201cThe generation that came to maturity after the end of Communism wouldn\u2019t have the same feelings as their parents, feelings summed up in my quote, because the world in which they have lived is a very different one.\u201dPoland\u2019s relationship with the United States is still seen as a crucial one here, most notably in terms of national security and especially in light of recent Russian aggression in neighboring Ukraine. But with Warsaw\u2019s growing focus on Europe, the United States has drifted out of the conversation.\u201cIt is not anti-Americanism,\u201d said Bohdan Szklarski, director of the American Studies Center at the University of Warsaw. \u201cNo one is burning Americans in effigy. Diplomats and American citizens can travel in safety.\u201dPeople simply talk less about America. \u201cNow, all the weekly papers are pro-European, and the focus of our attention has shifted from Washington to Brussels and Berlin,\u201d said Michal Sutowski, a 29-year-old commentator for the left-leaning movement, Krytyka Polityczna. \u201cYou look at TV news now, and it is all about Europe.\u201dWhat happened, Mr. Smolar said, was that Poland\u2019s entry into the European Union in 2004, and the subsequent ability of Poles to travel freely throughout the Continent for the first time, have made the United States less attractive both as a romantic ideal and as a place where Poles dream of living.Entry into the European Union pushed Poland to adopt European norms, from human rights to cleanliness standards in restaurants. Poles rapidly saw the benefits in such things as better roads and glittery malls.\u201cThe E.U. became seen as a way of getting rich and respectable, though we continued to be connected to the U.S. for security,\u201d Mr. Smolar said. \u201cWe began to realize that, for 90 percent of the problems we have, the solution is in Europe, not in America.\u201dStill, signs of love for the United States are prevalent in Warsaw. \u201cAmerican-style\u201d hot dogs and hamburgers are advertised in shop windows. The T-shirts worn on the streets by young Warsovians predominantly bear English words and American marketing slogans, as do shop windows in the upscale districts. A street festival last weekend in the fashionable neighborhood of Saska Kepa began with a Harley Davidson parade; its leader wore a Stars and Stripes helmet and a huge American flag on the back of his leather jacket.\u201cMy generation, we remember Communism, remember the Soviet presence here, remember the system under which we could not travel,\u201d Mr. Zaborowski said. \u201cBut the younger generation is now traveling throughout Europe.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Sutowski said his sole memory of the Communist years was standing in line one time with his grandmother to buy meat.\u201cYoung people today, when they think about emigrating, they think of London or Ireland,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung Poles are not anti-American. But America as a symbol of freedom? We do not think that way. We have no such strong sentimental feelings. It is a more calculated thing.\u201dMikolaj Jasiak, a 28-year-old Warsaw lawyer, said that even so, there is still a philosophical communion between young Poles and Americans. \u201cWe are much less anti-American than Western Europeans,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is because all of us in Poland are more concerned about security, but also because we are a new market economy, so people tend to be more individualistic, like Americans, and not collectivist, like the rest of Europe.\u201dAt a fragrant tea shop in the city\u2019s affluent Mokotow neighborhood, Mr. Szklarski opened his laptop. He had a copy of an unpublished government survey of Polish attitudes toward the United States that he said he was not authorized to release, but he shared some of the findings.When Poles were asked what came to mind when they thought about the United States, the most common answers were military might (26 percent) and wealth (18 percent). Only 6 percent thought of America as \u201can island of democracy and freedom,\u201d he said, the same percentage who responded \u201cobesity and rampant consumerism.\u201dMr. Szklarski shrugged. \u201cWe are difficult to handle, we Poles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are touchy. And our two countries, well, we don\u2019t communicate too well.\u201dMr. Zaborowski, the Polish institute director, said he expected the United States\u2019 popularity here to rise significantly \u2014 he has already seen signs of it, he said \u2014 as a consequence of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, which moved national security back to the fore of the Polish discussion.\u201cThe U.S.\u2019s rather strong reaction to that made people here realize the role of America is utterly indispensable in Europe,\u201d he said.For Mr. Smolar, a root of the problem is \u201ca dangerous mythology in the minds of many Poles for many years that Poland was a privileged partner of the United States, that we would get special consideration.\u201dPoles believed the American talk about the shared values and brotherly connection between the two nations, he said, so when larger American interests \u2014 like reassuring Russia or engaging with Asia \u2014 trumped Polish desires, the country felt snubbed, even humiliated.Part of the problem, he said, was that the terms \u201cpartner\u201d and \u201cally\u201d were used interchangeably in describing the countries\u2019 relationship. But they are not the same thing, he said: An ally offers international support and sheds blood in a crisis, while a partner shares in the profits.\u201cYou were saying partners when you really meant allies,\u201d Mr. Smolar said. \u201cWhile we said ally when we really meant partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Navigating a Post-Samsung Era", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 On May 10, the chairman of the Samsung Group, Lee Kun-hee, had a heart attack and stopped breathing. He was resuscitated at the hospital but remained in a coma for more than two weeks. As the country waited for information about his condition, rumors ran rampant. One of the most widely circulated was that Mr. Lee, 72, had already died and Samsung was covering it up. Samsung announced last week that Mr. Lee had stirred. One story goes that the chairman opened his eyes for a moment just when Lee Seung-Yeop, a Samsung Lions\u2019 slugger, hit a home run.The obsession with Mr. Lee\u2019s condition speaks to Samsung\u2019s outsized importance to the South Korean economy. Samsung is the prime example of a chaebol, one of the massive family-run conglomerates that are credited with leading the country through its postwar surge from an impoverished country to an economic powerhouse. Chaebols flourished with the support of successive authoritarian regimes, which lavished them with tax breaks and protection from foreign competition. But many South Koreans feel that chaebols have become too powerful. Several high-profile corruption scandals in recent years involving chaebol executives, and the light treatment they received from the courts, have only deepened the sense that the corporate behemoths have become too dominant. But is South Korea ready for weakened chaebols? What would happen if a company like Samsung were to fail? That\u2019s the question that naturally arose when Lee Kun-hee slipped into a coma. In 2013, Samsung accounted for about 20 percent of South Korea\u2019s total business profits. Samsung Electronics, just one of scores of subsidiaries, accounts for close to 15 percent of the total shares in the South Korean stock market. But you don\u2019t need to know these figures to get a feel for Samsung\u2019s hold on the country.A person could live here using only Samsung products. You could wake up in your Samsung C&T-built apartment, turn on your Samsung TV, and check the weather on a channel run by Lee Kun-hee\u2019s brother-in-law. On the subway, you could watch how the Samsung Lions lost their baseball game the night before on your Samsung Galaxy smartphone. On the weekend, you could spend time with your family at Samsung\u2019s Everland amusement park just outside of Seoul. And you could pay for everything using your Samsung credit card. Very few people predicted that Mr. Lee, the introverted, taciturn third son of Samsung\u2019s founder, Lee Byung-chull, would blossom after succeeding his father after his death in 1987 and turn the company into the economic giant it is today. But under Mr. Lee, Samsung thrived and became a top player in the smartphone and television markets. The share price has skyrocketed during his tenure. Samsung Electronics is now the No.1 pick among college students for where they want to work, a significant change from 20 years ago, when university campuses were largely critical of the conglomerates, which were suppressing the labor movement. About 200,000 university graduates, almost a third of the country\u2019s annual graduating class, sit for Samsung\u2019s employee aptitude test. In general, South Koreans\u2019 opinions of the conglomerate are mixed. There is an unmistakable pride that we feel over its success, which is tied to our country\u2019s rise over the last decades. But we are also very wary of Samsung\u2019s deep reach into society. In recent years Samsung has taken heat for health problems among former plant workers. But the most angry criticism of Samsung \u2014 and other chaebols \u2014 has come when they\u2019ve tried to compete with small-scale and independent businesses. In early 2012, Lee Kun-hee\u2019s daughter and the head of the Shilla hotel, Lee Boo-jin, pulled out of a high-end bakery and caf\u00e9 company amid criticism that the chaebols were devouring independent neighborhood bakeries. Chaebols that invested in car-repair shops or convenience stores also gave in to deteriorating public opinion and either folded or delayed their plans. Back in the mid-1990s, Samsung rolled out an ad campaign with the slogan, \u201cNo one remembers who came in second place.\u201d In 2013, some 90 percent of the profits from Samsung\u2019s subsidiaries came from Samsung Electronics, most of that from the smartphone division. If there were a slump in the smartphone market, Samsung Electronics would have huge difficulties, which would affect the entire conglomerate. The chances are quite high that this, in turn, would create a domino effect that would be a blow to the national economy.As Samsung prepares for its post-Lee Kun-hee future, South Korea needs to prepare for a post-Samsung future. Just like any other company, Samsung can fail, and if that happens, how will the South Korean economy overcome the shock? If we don\u2019t decrease our over-reliance on the chaebols and prepare to let smaller, dynamic start-ups fill the gaps in their place, it won\u2019t.Advertisement"}

Four Palestinians, one of them 15, have been killed by Israeli troops, their photos hoisted at mass funerals as martyrs in the liberation struggle.The abduction and its aftermath, in which Israel has unleashed its most intense West Bank crackdown in nearly a decade, have shaken the Palestinian leadership body that works with international negotiators and have roiled a territory that those diplomats have envisioned as a future Palestinian state. Any prospect for a return to Israeli-Palestinian talks seems ever more remote.The crisis at first buoyed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel with a wave of domestic unity and international outrage, but he has begun to see a backlash against Israel\u2019s arrest campaign. He faces demands to provide proof backing his claim that Hamas is behind the abduction, and even members of his own cabinet have second-guessed his dismissal of Mr. Abbas\u2019s supportive statement.With the wider Middle East engulfed in violent turmoil, analysts increasingly fear the explosion of a third intifada in the West Bank and Gaza Strip \u2014 or the unraveling of the Palestinian Authority \u2014 if the teenagers are not found and the Israeli campaign continues to erode Mr. Abbas\u2019s credibility and control.\u201cIn Israel, the whole country is obsessed by this and can\u2019t think of anything more horrible, and on the Palestinian side, you see these cartoons where it\u2019s celebrated,\u201d said Dennis B. Ross, the former American peace negotiator, who arrived in Jerusalem during the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the two publics, it\u2019s the two leaders who have looked at each other through a lens of basic disbelief.\u201dBefore dawn Sunday, Palestinian protesters clashed not only with Israeli soldiers but also, for the first time, with their own security forces, smashing at least four police cars and storming a police station in the West Bank city of Ramallah that Israeli troops had used as a staging area.Palestinian health officials said that Muhammad Mahmoud Atta Ismail, 31, was slain on a Ramallah rooftop by an Israeli sniper, and that in a separate shooting, Ahmad Said Saoud Khaled, 27, bled to death after he was wounded in the abdomen, back and thigh by Israeli troops he encountered en route to a mosque in Nablus for the dawn prayer.The Israeli military said 340 Palestinians, two-thirds of them Hamas politicians or operatives, had been arrested by Sunday morning in an operation called Brother\u2019s Keeper. Troops have searched some 1,350 locations across the West Bank \u2014 homes, caves, Hamas charities and media outlets, and at least three university campuses.A military spokeswoman said tunnels where explosive devices were manufactured and stored had been discovered. Roadblocks around Hebron, the West Bank\u2019s largest city, were removed Sunday after a week of what Palestinians called a siege that had cost the local economy some $12 million a day.\u201cIf Israel is trying to bring down this Palestinian Authority, then they\u2019re making no mistakes \u2014 they\u2019re doing it in a perfect way,\u201d said Ghassan Khatib, vice president of Birzeit University in the West Bank, where the student union was raided Friday morning. \u201cThe Israelis are pushing the Palestinian people very hard for a violent reaction. There might be a silent majority who are worried about things going out of hand, but in these kinds of emotional situations, an angry minority can be dangerous.\u201dFanning the flames, the Palestinian foreign minister, Riyad al-Malki, lent credence Sunday to conspiracy theories circulating on social media about Israel\u2019s having staged the abduction as a pretext to crack down on Hamas and derail the reconciliation. He, like Mr. Abbas, questioned Israel\u2019s \u201cabsence of proof\u201d connecting Hamas to the kidnapping and told a Saudi newspaper that it could be \u201ca childish game on the part of Israel.\u201dInterviews in the West Bank and Gaza showed widespread embrace of this idea. At the same time, many people praised the abduction as the best hope for securing the release of Palestinians in Israeli jails, like the 1,027 prisoners freed in 2011 in exchange for Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier held captive for five years by Hamas militants in Gaza.\u201cThis is a brave operation, and I support it,\u201d Yahia Akila, 50, who owns a juice and ice cream shop in Gaza City, said on Saturday. \u201cPolitics do not work with the Israelis. This is the language they understand.\u201dAt Friday\u2019s funeral for 15-year-old Mohammed Jihad Dudeen, who was killed hours earlier while throwing stones at Israeli soldiers, dozens in the crowd of 6,000 shouted, \u201cHow sweet and fine the abduction was!\u201d while brandishing the yellow, green, black and red flags of various Palestinian factions.\u201cThe masses in the streets, in their private conversations, wish and hope for even more kidnappings,\u201d said Jihad Rabi, 40, who works at a medical lab in Dura, the town near Hebron where Mohammed was killed.\u201cThe third intifada has become an inevitable,\u201d said Mr. Rabi, a father of six. \u201cAny person who loses the sense of safety for himself, his family, his property, he will respond. Unfortunately, it is impossible to achieve peace through negotiation. The bloodshed is unavoidable.\u201dYossi Klein Halevi, an American-Israeli author, said he had rarely seen such emotional unity here. Hundreds of thousands of Israeli Jews lit three extra Shabbat candles on Friday to represent the teenagers, he said, and shopkeepers greet strangers with a wish for good news about \u201cour boys.\u201d\u201cThis goes to the most basic D.N.A. of the society: We are a society that lives and survives in the Middle East because we send our sons into situations of unbearable risk,\u201d Mr. Halevi said. \u201cAll of our communal feelings and all of our existential feelings converge on this event, and it\u2019s enforced by everything that\u2019s happening on our borders.\u201dJason Gardner, 38, a hotel executive and ultramarathoner, said Israelis \u201call feel very helpless,\u201d so he and five friends decided to \u201cdo something extreme.\u201d Starting at 2:30 a.m. Friday, they ran some 28 miles from the Western Wall in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City to the Nof Ayalon home of Naftali Fraenkel, 16, the dual American-Israeli citizen who was captured along with his friend Gilad Shaar, 16, and Eyal Yifrach, 19, while hitchhiking home from the West Bank.About 18 miles in, \u201cmy knees wanted to give out,\u201d Mr. Gardner recalled. \u201cI was saying, \u2018Ow, ow, ow,\u2019 and I said to my friend, \u2018What am I complaining about? Think about what these three guys are going through.\u2019 And, I swear, the pain went away.\u201dSaid Ghazali contributed reporting from the West Bank, and Fares Akram from Gaza.Advertisement"}

The leader of the nationalist Jewish Home faction, Naftali Bennett, said the American decision \u201csends a message that terrorism pays.\u201d Even Nachman Shai, a lawmaker with the left-leaning Labor Party, called the step \u201ca slap in the face from the Americans.\u201dThough the new government was formed with Hamas\u2019s consent, its 17 ministers are professionals without formal links to any political faction. Mr. Abbas promised on Monday that the new government would follow his policy of recognizing Israel, renouncing violence and adhering to prior Palestinian-Israeli agreements, things that Hamas refuses to do. The prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, gave similar assurances in a meeting with European diplomats on Tuesday after the cabinet\u2019s first meeting.Though United States law bars financing any Palestinian government under \u201cundue influence by Hamas,\u201d Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, said on Monday, \u201cWith what we know now, we will work with this government.\u201d The statement appeared to widen fissures between the United States and Israel.\u201cWe\u2019ve had disagreements over settlements, over Jerusalem \u2014 I see this as more fundamental; it\u2019s a source of grave concern,\u201d said Michael B. Oren, Israel\u2019s previous ambassador in Washington.\u201cIt delivers a blow to American credibility, and American credibility is cardinal here,\u201d Mr. Oren added. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, if Israel is going to make concessions for peace, is going to take risks for peace, we have to rely on our alliance with the United States. There has to be deep trust.\u201dSeveral Israeli officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect internal discussions, said they were stunned by Washington\u2019s decision. Mr. Netanyahu told his inner cabinet Monday afternoon that the Americans intended to \u201cwait awhile\u201d before deciding how to deal with the new government, according to someone present, who said that assurance influenced the cabinet\u2019s decision not to immediately impose sanctions.But a couple of hours later, Secretary of State John Kerry called Mr. Netanyahu and told him Washington was not waiting.Ms. Psaki made it clear in a briefing with reporters on Monday that Washington would \u201ccontinue to evaluate the composition and policies of the new government and, if needed, we\u2019ll modify our approach.\u201dFor weeks, the Americans had told Mr. Netanyahu and his aides that they would withhold judgment until the new government was officially formed, and some were skeptical that it would even happen, since previous reconciliation deals between Hamas and Mr. Abbas\u2019s faction, Fatah, never bore fruit. Once the ministers were sworn in, Washington had to decide whether money could continue flowing to the Palestinian Authority to sustain its aid programs and pay its employees.Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said Friday that Washington had consistently said its test would be whether a Palestinian government included Hamas members as ministers. \u201cOur position on Hamas has in no way changed, period, full stop,\u201d Ms. Harf said.But Mr. Bennett, Israel\u2019s economy minister, said in an interview, \u201cWe feel that the red lines have been blurred and crossed.\u201d\u201cRegardless of the practical issues, the resounding message is that the world\u2019s leading nation is talking to a government backed by one of the deadliest terrorist groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much we can play charades.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Doubting Putin, Obama Prepares to Add Pressure", "Date": "2014-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration has drawn up plans to escalate sanctions against Russia by targeting its financial, energy and defense industries, but faces resistance from European allies hoping to avoid a broader economic clash with Moscow that would hurt their own businesses. Even as the Kremlin voices support for a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine, American officials remain unconvinced that it has backed up words with deeds. Russia has moved troops back to the border and positioned heavy artillery there in what American officials consider an effort to help the separatists, who on Tuesday shot down a Ukrainian military helicopter.But President Obama faces hurdles as he tries to keep the pressure up on the government of President Vladimir V. Putin. European Union leaders, who are scheduled to meet Friday in Brussels, are reluctant to go along if it looks like Mr. Putin may be backing down. And American business leaders objecting to unilateral actions that would hurt their companies are kicking off an advertising campaign to oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s plans.Mr. Obama spoke with Mr. Putin on Monday to urge him to take more tangible steps to defuse the crisis, and the Russian leader on Tuesday seemed to respond by asking his Parliament to rescind formal authorization to intervene militarily in Ukraine. American officials considered the move positive but symbolic, assuming that it was really meant to undercut European support for additional sanctions.As Secretary of State John Kerry and other American diplomats visited Brussels to talk with their European counterparts, Mr. Obama called Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain on Tuesday to consult on the next steps in the crisis, which could be decided this week. Both men indicated afterward that Russia had yet to take the sort of actions demanded by the Group of 7 industrial nations this month to avoid additional sanctions.\u201cWhat we\u2019re focused here on is not just the words of the Russian president, though we welcome them,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on are the actions.\u201dMr. Cameron\u2019s office said Russia had not halted the flow of militants and arms into Ukraine nor stopped training separatist groups. The American and British leaders \u201creaffirmed their commitment to implementing further sanctions on Russia if these things don\u2019t happen,\u201d Mr. Cameron\u2019s office said in a statement.The Obama administration has developed three options for further actions, according to government officials: banning any interactions with some of Russia\u2019s largest banks; cutting off technology transfers to Russian energy and defense firms; and shutting down business with Russian defense companies.Any of these actions would go far beyond the narrow penalties meted out to date against individual Russian officials, businessmen and their companies. But they would fall short of the most powerful sanctions available, like those imposed on Iran. American officials have concluded that Iran-style sanctions would not be as effective against Russia, which has a broader economy. Instead, they are looking for actions that will have demonstrable impact but also avoid disrupting global markets.Congressional aides briefed by the administration said the planned moves would be a forceful increase in pressure on Russia but not a full-scale economic attack. While the plans will not assuage some lawmakers who have called for tougher action, the aides said they would go a long way toward satisfying many.Whether the Europeans would go along remained an open question. American officials expressed optimism that they were finding common ground with the allies but recognized that it was unlikely that the European Union, with 28 member states that operate by consensus, would take the same actions as the United States. The Europeans may also move to defer the toughest steps.European Union foreign ministers met to discuss Ukraine on Monday. When European heads of state meet on Friday, crucial to any decision will be Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose country has extensive energy and economic ties to Russia. Mr. Obama spoke last Friday with Ms. Merkel as well as with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France to press for continued unity. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called President Petro O. Poroshenko twice in two days.American officials were urging their European counterparts not to give too much credit to Mr. Putin for positive statements in recent days. Twice before, the Americans argued \u2014 in April and then again this month when he attended a D-Day commemoration in France \u2014 Mr. Putin has seemed to embark on what they called a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d to deflate any momentum within the European Union toward tougher sanctions.If the Europeans are not willing to impose new sanctions after Friday\u2019s meeting, the American side hopes to reach agreement on a package that would be ready to use if Mr. Putin does not follow through on his recent positive statements or reverts back to more hostile actions once the meeting has passed. In effect, that would make the sanctions package a deterrent.Some analysts said the support for sanctions has diminished in Europe. Macro-Advisory Ltd., a consultant firm in Moscow, told clients that there might be \u201cso-called scalpel sanctions later this week\u201d but predicted that \u201cthe emergence of political pragmatism in Kiev and Moscow\u201d would avert \u201cmore serious trade- and economy-disrupting sanctions.\u201dThe drive for more sanctions comes as American businesses are growing more vocal in protesting the possibility that the United States may act on its own. While lobbying the White House and Congress quietly until now, leading business groups plan to start a wide advertising campaign voicing their concerns.\u201cWith escalating global tensions, some U.S. policy makers are considering a course of sanctions that history shows hurts American interests,\u201d reads an advertisement to be placed in major newspapers on Thursday. \u201cWe are concerned about actions that would harm American manufacturers and cost American jobs.\u201dThe ad, signed by Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, and Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, will be placed in The Financial Times, The Hill, The New York Times, Politico, Roll Call, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. A copy was provided on Tuesday by someone not directly affiliated with either sponsoring organization.Linda Dempsey, the vice president for international economic affairs at the manufacturers association, would not discuss the ad campaign but said American businesses would be unduly harmed if Washington proceeded with sanctions that were not matched by Europe.\u201cUnilateral sanctions by the United States end up with other countries and their industries filling the void,\u201d she said. \u201cThe harm and the real impact of those unilateral sanctions is on U.S. industries and U.S. workers. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re out of the market for a year or two. We could get out of the market for decades.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Executive Powers, Obama Begins His Last Big Push on Climate Policy", "Date": "2014-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 All but giving up on Congress, President Obama has spent the year foraging for issues he could tackle on his own, and largely coming up with minor executive orders. But on Monday, he will unveil a plan to take on climate change that may be his last, most sweeping effort to remake America in his remaining time in office.The far-reaching regulations will for the first time force power plants in the United States to curb the carbon emissions that scientists say have been damaging the planet. By using authority already embedded in law, Mr. Obama does not need Congress \u2014 so, in this era of gridlock, he has a chance to transform the nation\u2019s energy sector and, at the same time, his presidency.While the administration was still completing crucial elements of the plan, it was already clear that the economic stakes are enormous. The new regulations could eventually shutter hundreds of coal-fired power plants. Critics wasted little time arguing that the president\u2019s unilateral plan abuses his power in a way that will cost jobs and raise energy prices for consumers.Almost by default, climate change looks to be the defining domestic initiative of Mr. Obama\u2019s second term. His aspirations to enact gun control measures, pass a jobs plan, overhaul the tax code and reach a grand bargain on long-term spending all have eluded him amid Republican opposition. He may yet negotiate legislation liberalizing immigration policy, but otherwise harbors little hope for major new domestic action.In taking on climate change, Mr. Obama is returning to one of the themes of his first campaign for president, when he vowed that his election would be remembered as the moment when \u201cour planet began to heal.\u201d His difficulties living up to that rhetoric has deeply frustrated many supporters, and he personally urged his Environmental Protection Agency chief, Gina McCarthy, to draft an ambitious regulation in time to ensure that it is finalized before he leaves office.Having failed to pass climate legislation through the Senate in his first term, Mr. Obama has used his own power to advance his goals, including increased fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks. In seeking to limit power plants, he is finally addressing the most significant source of carbon pollution. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important and the biggest reductions that we\u2019ll get,\u201d said John D. Podesta, the president\u2019s counselor and a prime advocate of environmental policies. \u201cFinally tackling climate in a significant way, this is a big deal.\u201dAnd yet the president seems to have chosen a low-wattage rollout of the plan. He will not unveil it in a televised East Room address or travel to some out-of-town venue for a big speech, as he has for moves of far less import. Instead, he will leave it to Ms. McCarthy to announce on Monday, while he plays a supporting role by making a telephone call to the American Lung Association.That may reflect the complicated politics of the issue. Republicans are not the only ones concerned about economic costs, or for that matter political ones. Democrats from coal-producing states are acutely nervous with midterm elections approaching.Representative Nick J. Rahall II, Democrat of West Virginia, for one, has already distanced himself from the plan. \u201cI will oppose this rule as it will adversely affect coal miners and coal-mining communities throughout West Virginia and the nation,\u201d he said.The new regulation, which must go through a period of public comment before taking effect, will set a national standard to cut carbon from power plants. It will offer states a menu of options to achieve those cuts, such as adding wind and solar power and energy-efficient technology and joining or creating state-level emissions trading programs called cap and trade.But as recently as last week, according to people close to the process, officials had not decided which year to use as the baseline for determining cuts. The coal industry has pushed for 2005, when emissions were near their peak, while environmentalists want a baseline of 2012, when they were lower, meaning that cuts would have to be deeper.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Jobless Claims Dip, Growth Picks Up Speed ", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated in June, providing more evidence that the economy was strengthening after a very weak first quarter.\u201cThe economy has improved markedly in recent months,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \u201cSigns point to continued growth in the coming quarters, and further improvement in labor market conditions.\u201dInitial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 312,000 for the week that ended June 14, the Labor Department said on Thursday.The four-week moving average for new jobless claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market conditions as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,750 to 311,750, not far from a seven-year low touched in May.Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its business activity index jumped to 17.8 this month, the highest level since September, from 15.4 in May. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region\u2019s manufacturing.Gains were driven by a surge in new orders, and an increase in factory employment and working hours. Improvements also occurred in delivery times, shipments and unfilled orders, which rebounded strongly from May\u2019s slump.Another report showed a gauge of future growth rose in May, its fourth month of gains. The Conference Board said its index of leading indicators rose 0.5 percent last month, up from a 0.3 percent increase in April. The reports joined data on employment and the manufacturing and services sectors in painting an upbeat picture of the economy after a contraction in the first quarter tied to the harsh winter.The government said last month that the economy shrank at a 1 percent annual rate, but economists say more recent data suggests the contraction was even deeper.But second-quarter data, including the reports on Thursday, bolstered the case the Federal Reserve made this week that the economy was bouncing back. The Fed sharply cut its 2014 growth forecast, but it further reduced the amount of money it is pumping into the economy each month through bond purchases.The jobless claims data covered the survey week for the government\u2019s report on June employment, which will be released in two weeks. The four-week average for claims fell 11,000 between the May and June survey periods, suggesting payroll growth probably increased from last month\u2019s gain of 217,000 jobs.\u201cThe ongoing low levels of initial claims suggest there is a good chance that we will see another respectable advance in payrolls,\u201d said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS.Other measures like job openings and hiring intentions by small businesses have also pointed to a healthier labor market. The economy has recovered the 8.7 million jobs lost during the recession and has posted four straight months of job gains above 200,000, the strongest stretch since early 2000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shinzo Abe\u2019s Bid to Shake Up Corporate Japan", "Date": "2014-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisEven for the land that invented Toyota-style efficiency, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is on a tear. His ruling Liberal Democratic Party pushed 98 percent of its bills through Parliament, a success rate not seen in Japan for over a decade. But after a meteoric rise in the market last year, Tokyo shares have lately lost momentum as investors increasingly question whether Japan\u2019s hard-charging prime minister can actually achieve his ambitious goals. Mr. Abe\u2019s solution? Another blast of economic measures. And in a harbinger of just how far he will go to rouse Japan\u2019s long-sluggish economy, he promised, among other things, to take on Japan\u2019s staid corporate managers and one of the most sacred of sacred cows: the nation\u2019s interlocking connections among Japanese companies that form the core of Japan, Inc. In a televised address to the nation on Tuesday, Mr. Abe unveiled a fresh set of economic policies intended to kick-start growth in Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy. The country needs more women in the workplace, he said, and more entrepreneurs and more foreign workers. Japanese corporations would do well to ditch their anemic seniority-based systems and start rewarding high performers. And company boards need to start hustling to generate better returns and lure back investors.\u201cIn my growth strategy, there are neither taboos nor sacred cows,\u201d Mr. Abe said. \u201cThere is only a singular, strong devotion to see this through to the very end.\u201dAmong domestic and foreign investors, however, skepticism is rife. In his bid to raise economic growth, Mr. Abe has so far relied heavily on monetary and fiscal stimulus, which he refers to as the first two \u201carrows\u201d of his so-called Abenomics agenda. The most highly anticipated third arrow \u2014 changes intended to bring a healthy dose of competition and innovation to the economy \u2014 has largely underwhelmed.Despite the flurry of bills and proposals adopted this year, details have yet to be worked out even on centerpiece measures, like lowering Japan\u2019s effective corporate tax rate, which is one of the highest in the industrialized world, at 35 percent. The plan, for now, is to cut it to below 30 percent over the next years.Already, powerful voices have warned against cutting Japan\u2019s corporate tax rate without securing other sources of revenue for the cash-starved government. In other sensitive areas, like labor market deregulation and tradition-bound agriculture, proposals have already been watered down.\u201cThe Abe government will likely struggle to implement all but the most inoffensive of policies in the growth strategy,\u201d Tobias Harris, a Japan expert at the corporate advisory firm Teneo Intelligence, said in a note.One highlight of Mr. Abe\u2019s growth platform, however, has been a promised overhaul of corporate governance, where the administration has laid out a robust set of proposals to bring significant change to the way Japanese corporations are run. Japan\u2019s financial regulator has already introduced new guidelines to bolster shareholders\u2019 monitoring of Japanese companies.The government is also preparing what advisers say will be a world-class corporate governance code that requires multiple independent outside directors, formal protection of whistle-blowers, and other measures that proponents say would have been unthinkable before Mr. Abe came to power a year and a half ago.These corporate governance reforms also seek to put an end to a decades-old tradition: the practice of holding shares in one another to create a web of relationships meant to keep unwanted interference to a minimum.It is not easily visible on the surface, but Japan\u2019s biggest corporations are linked together in a sprawling web of mutual shareholdings that shield company executives from the pressures of the stock market. Coddled in a comfortable old boys\u2019 club, Japanese executives have long gone unpenalized for failed investments, refusing to withdraw from money-losing businesses, hoarding cash and bringing shareholders perennially low returns.Mr. Abe\u2019s government sees the cozy arrangements as out of place these days, especially as the country seeks to win over foreign investors. Mr. Abe\u2019s latest round of measures calls for a reduction in cross-shareholdings to \u201cas low a level as possible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the simple answer to the question of how to raise Japan\u2019s productivity,\u201d Masaaki Kanno, Japan economist at JPMorgan Securities, said this month. \u201cThe role of the shareholder will be more important.\u201dTake Ezaki Glico, the Osaka-based candy maker that has long struggled to generate steady returns on equity. Glico\u2019s equity relationships to companies far removed from its chocolate and chewing gum business have long protected its management, and thwarted shareholders\u2019 demands for a corporate overhaul.According to regulatory filings, Glico\u2019s cross-shareholdings include mutual stakes in companies as diverse as Duskin, a cleaning services company; Toppan Printing, which puts out books; and the TV network Tokyo Broadcasting System. Glico even has a cross-shareholding relationship with House Foods, a rival in the snacks business, as well as its main lenders.Those relationships came in handy for Glico\u2019s beleaguered management in 2008, when Steel Partners, an American hedge fund led by the billionaire Warren G. Lichtenstein, tried to force Glico to overhaul management, and accept an outside board member.Glico\u2019s allies rallied to the rescue, approving a poison-pill measure that effectively shut down Steel Partners\u2019 efforts. By the end of the year, the hedge fund had dumped its roughly $175 million stake in Glico; foreign observers cried foul. For all the efforts to put an end to such practices in Japan, recent filings show they remain prevalent \u2014 especially between companies, like Glico, with a history of being targeted by activist investors. And it is unclear how effectively the government can pressure companies to disentangle their shareholdings. Indeed, while Mr. Abe\u2019s economic platform is widely seen as impressive, the challenge \u2014 as investors in Japan have learned from the country\u2019s previous attempts at change \u2014 is to carry the plans through. Many parts of the Abenomics strategy have been intentionally left vague, to avoid attacks and help win the favor of the country\u2019s powerful bureaucrats and interest groups.But nailing down those details, and preventing those various interests from watering down Mr. Abe\u2019s goals, will fully test his much-vaunted political skills. An earlier version of a graphic with this article misstated the name of a television network. It is the Tokyo Broadcasting System, not the Tokyo Broadcasting Corporation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Factory Orders Climb for a Third Month ", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFactory orders rose for a third consecutive month in April, adding to evidence that manufacturing is regaining momentum after a harsh winter.Orders increased 0.7 percent in April, propelled by a surge in demand for military hardware, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday. That followed increases of 1.5 percent in March and 1.7 percent in February.The improvements occurred after big declines in January and December, which partly reflected a harsh winter. The three solid monthly gains in factory orders should provide support to the overall economy, which is expected to rebound robustly in the April-June quarter.The economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, shrank at an annual rate of 1 percent in the January-March quarter, reflecting winter storms that disrupted business activity. But in the current quarter, analysts estimate G.D.P. will advance at an annual rate as high as 3.8 percent.Economists say that growth will remain strong in the second half of this year as consumer spending benefits from rising employment, which is providing households with more income.The report on factory orders showed that demand for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, increased 0.6 percent in April. Orders for nondurable goods like paper and chemicals rose 0.7 percent in April after a decline of 0.5 percent in March.The overall increase reflected a sharp rise in demand for defense products including airplanes and communications equipment. Excluding defense, orders fell 0.1 percent in April.Transportation orders grew 1.4 percent despite the fact that orders for commercial aircraft, a volatile category, dropped 7.9 percent and demand for autos and auto parts slipped 0.2 percent.Demand for machinery fell 2.8 percent, with orders for construction equipment down 7.2 percent. Orders for computers dropped 13.2 percent, while demand for electrical appliances and other electrical products rose 1.3 percent.Economists predict factory activity will gain strength in coming months, helped by rising consumer demand and a rebound in export sales.In other encouraging news, a separate report this week showed that the contraction in China\u2019s manufacturing sector eased in May. It was the latest sign that the slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy behind the United States, is stabilizing.China\u2019s economy has slowed from double-digit rates of expansion, with growth falling to 7.4 percent in the first quarter as leaders have tried to reduce dependence on trade and investment in favor of domestic consumption. The slowdown had raised concerns about export growth in other nations including the United States.Advertisement"}

In the Texas campaign, except for a couple of obligatory questions about a border fence during a Democratic debate, immigration has been the dog that didn\u2019t bark. The candidates who would have made an issue of it exited the race long ago...After a year of political whiplash, it seems safe to conclude that the anti-immigration fervor was never as bad as it seemed but isn\u2019t permanently gone, either. As ever, we Americans like to say that we live in a nation of immigrants. But we are also prone to believing that the last great immigrants were the ones who arrived decades ago. The country can never quite make up its mind how open it should be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fearing a Junta Crackdown, Cambodian Workers Stream Out of Thailand", "Date": "2014-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTens of thousands of Cambodians working in Thailand have fled the country in a chaotic exodus that appears to be driven by fears of a crackdown on illegal foreign laborers by the military junta that seized power in Thailand last month. The abrupt departures threaten to strain relations between the two countries and could hurt both Thai industries that rely on Cambodian workers and the Cambodian economy, which benefits from the workers\u2019 remittances.\u201cIt has been chaos,\u201d Anek Manusnirobon, the head of customs at the Aranyaprathet border checkpoint, said on Sunday. Mr. Anek added that officials opened extra departure lanes after the line of trucks and buses leaving the country reached four kilometers, or more than two miles.The Thai Foreign Ministry issued a statement Saturday saying rumors circulating about the \u201cmilitary\u2019s abusive treatment of illegal workers\u201d were false.Joe Lowry, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental organization that is helping the Cambodians return, said rumors were playing a \u201csubstantial\u201d role in spurring the departures.\u201cThere is certainly a lack of clear information,\u201d he said, \u201cand people trust what they hear from their own communities.\u201dMore than 122,000 Cambodians had crossed the border at the Aranyaprathet checkpoint over the past week, Mr. Lowry said Monday. There had also been an unknown number of crossings at other, smaller checkpoints along the border.The Thai economy relies on around three million foreigners, mainly from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, who work in factories, on construction sites and as domestic servants for wealthy and middle-class Thais and expatriates, among other menial jobs. Some Thai news outlets said there were concerns that businesses would be short-staffed if the departures continued \u2014 and especially if they spread to workers from Myanmar, who are much more numerous.Cambodia and Thailand are historical enemies, but people have moved relatively easily across the porous border between the countries for years. Cambodians waiting to leave described a sort of collective hysteria in the Cambodian community living in Thailand. Some said they did not have clear reasons for the urgency of their departures.Na Kuan, 22, one of several dozen Cambodian workers packed into a bus at the border, said that he had \u201cno idea\u201d why he was returning but that he had been urged by so many relatives to go that he joined the exodus.\u201cMy parents, my brothers, my sisters all called me from Cambodia saying I must return home,\u201d he said.We Kaowwee, a street food vendor and part-time construction worker who has lived in Thailand for 15 years, said \u201cnews\u201d had spread that Cambodian people were killed by the Thai military.\u201cI\u2019ve never felt this fear before in Thailand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth living here right now. I don\u2019t want to risk it. We are all afraid of the military.\u201dThe military government has struck a mildly nationalistic tone in recent weeks, criticizing protests against the coup as un-Thai and warning the subsidiary of a Norwegian telecom company, Telenor, that it would scrutinize its shareholding structure to check for legal violations. The comments came after the company revealed that the junta had ordered a temporary blockage of Facebook.The Foreign Ministry said the junta\u2019s intention was to \u201cclean up society from illegal activities which include gambling, drugs and illegal workers.\u201d\u201cThe cleanup process of illegal workers will take place gradually with the intention not to affect Thai businesses that rely on foreign workers,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said.The junta has sought to play down the exodus. Patamaporn Ratanadilok na Phuket, a spokeswoman for the military government, described the return of Cambodian families to their homes as \u201cnormal\u201d because it was harvest season.\u201cThe Cambodian people have to rush back to help their families,\u201d she said. A number of Cambodians at the border, however, said they were not returning to help on farms and many of them were returning to urban areas.Ms. Patamaporn added that rumors of a crackdown had prompted business owners to \u201cdeport their migrant workers temporarily.\u201d\u201cWe would like to affirm that there\u2019s no order to crack down on migrant workers as has been reported,\u201d she added.An employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Aranyaprathet, Thailand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Euro Zone, Recession Is Not Quite Over, Economists Say", "Date": "2014-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Many people probably thought the euro zone recession ended about a year ago when output began growing again. Not so, a group of leading economists argued this week.Recessions are often considered to be over when there have been two quarters in a row of positive growth. The euro zone hit that mark when it squeezed out annualized growth of 0.5 percent in the third quarter after growth of 1.3 percent in the second quarter.But the research group, a nonprofit organization based in London, does not accept that definition. It says that economists and policy makers should look more broadly at other indicators, like the sustainability of growth and unemployment. Joblessness in the euro zone is 11.7 percent, just below a record.The recession that began in mid-2011 is the longest since the group began keeping track in 1970.Whether the recession is over is to some extent a question of semantics. Tom Rogers, an economist in London who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said he thought the euro zone was recovering because of the number of quarters of expansion.But he agreed that growth was weak, and pointed out that a number of countries including Italy remained in recession.\u201cWhether people on the ground, where unemployment remains very high, feel materially better is a different question,\u201d said Mr. Rogers, who is not a member of the group\u2019s panel, the euro area business cycle-dating committee.The European group has no official status but includes many leading economists. The chairman of the business cycle committee is Philippe Weil, president of the French Economic Observatory, a research group in Paris.The conclusions of the panel, which meets periodically to consider the state of euro zone growth, are likely to add to growing unease about whether the bloc is on the mend or whether it is tipping into a new crisis.Annual inflation is 0.5 percent, well below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just under 2 percent, and many economists have expressed alarm about the risk of deflation, a downward spiral of prices that causes consumers to stop spending and companies to stop hiring.And while investors have flocked back to the region\u2019s government debt and European stocks have rebounded from crisis lows, output in the 18 countries of the euro zone has still not recovered to the level of 2008, when the financial crisis began.The euro zone economy grew at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2014. The European Central Bank this month forecast that the bloc would grow 1 percent this year, 1.7 percent 2015 and 1.8 percent in 2016.\u200bDespite the overall movement forward, economic output shrank in eight euro zone countries in the first quarter, including the Netherlands and Finland. Growth was zero in France, which has the second-largest economy in the euro zone after Germany.Even the powerhouse German economy has been showing signs of trouble. Confidence has slumped markedly among companies that do business with Russia because of the crisis in Ukraine, according to a survey by the Ifo Institute in Munich.While confidence among all German companies continues to increase, the pace has slowed, the Ifo Institute said on Wednesday.\u201cFor companies that have relations to Russia, the business outlook in particular has worsened more so than for companies that have no dealings with Russia,\u201d Timo Wollmersh\u00e4user, acting head of business cycle analysis and surveys at the Ifo Institute, said in a statement.The moderate increase in business confidence this year, he said, \u201cis in good part due to concerns over the Ukraine conflict.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated percentage growth in the euro zone in the second and third quarters. It hit annualized growth of\u00a00.5 percent in the third quarter, not 0.4 percent; and growth increased 1.3\u00a0percent in the second quarter, not 1.2 percent.An earlier version of this article misidentified the group that issued the statement on the recession. It is the Center for Economic Policy Research, not the Center for European Policy Research.An earlier version of this article misstated the euro zone economy\u2019s annual rate growth in the first quarter of 2014. It was 0.7\u00a0percent, not 0.8 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumers Will Spend More on Health Care in 2015, Report Predicts", "Date": "2014-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyGrowth in health care spending is expected to tick upward next year, in part because consumers who delayed treatment during the economic downturn are now seeking care they postponed, according to a report released on Tuesday.The projected increase is modest compared with the double-digit annual increases in medical inflation commonly seen before the economic downturn. But the rate of growth had been slowing in the past five years, so the upward shift is worth noting, said Ceci Connolly, managing director of the institute, the research arm of PricewaterhouseCooper\u2019s health consulting practice.This so-called medical cost trend is the projected change in the cost to treat patients from one year to the next, and it\u2019s a major factor used to determine plan premiums. The analysis measures spending growth in the employer-based health plan market, which covers about 150 million people. The forecast reflects the cost of services, as well as the amount of services used.Now that the economy has improved, Ms. Connolly said, people are better able to afford treatments. \u201cFolks who postponed some services \u2014 some elective, some more serious \u2014 are going ahead and taking care of it,\u201d she said.Typically, employers adjust their health plan offerings in response to the cost trend, such as by increasing employees\u2019 deductibles \u2014 the amount you pay before insurance coverage kicks in \u2014 or narrowing the network of doctors in the plan. So the net increase, after those changes are taken into account, is predicted to be about 4.8 percent. \u201cIt probably means some additional cost shifted to individuals,\u201d Ms. Connolly said.Some employers already offer a high-deductible health plan as the only option for employees, and nearly half say they are considering making it the sole option in the next three years, according to the report. That is forcing consumers to pay more attention to pricing when they seek care. The institute\u2019s research found that in 2013, roughly half of consumers who shopped for health care called around to different providers for prices, though that information is still hard to come by in many cases. \u201cThis is a big pressure point in health care,\u201d Ms. Connolly said.Here are some questions about health costs:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Slumdog Millionaire Architect", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe offices of Hafeez Contractor, India\u2019s most commercially successful architect, are on Bank Street, just around the corner from the Mumbai Stock Exchange. The prestige of the address, however, is undermined by the beleaguered state of the Raj-era building. In the reception area, a flat-screen displaying a loop of Contractor\u2019s futuristic projects is mounted on a cracked, stained plaster wall. Upstairs, hundreds of designers sit shoulder to shoulder at long rows of computer monitors, packed in almost as mercilessly as on the commuter trains that ferry them to work each day. The office has struggled to keep up with the firm\u2019s expanding work force and is perpetually under construction. Staff members were known to walk 15 minutes to the five-star Taj Mahal Palace Hotel rather than brave the employee-restroom line. Contractor has vastly increased his square footage by building a loft, but a day at the office now entails ducking through archways, dodging stray wires and ignoring the wail of power saws.From this unlikely office, Contractor is helping to create the face of 21st-century India \u2014 a nation of flourishing wealth and entrenched poverty that looks, according to the economists Amartya Sen and Jean Dr\u00e8ze, \u201cmore and more like islands of California in a sea of sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d More than anyone else, it is Contractor who is responsible for building those \u201cislands.\u201d He has done this in part by designing elaborate corporate campuses on the outskirts of cities, like his projects for Infosys, the Bangalore-based technology giant that employs more than 160,000 people. For Infosys, he built a software-development park outside Pune that features two avant-garde office orbs, which Contractor calls his \u201cdew drops,\u201d and a 337-acre corporate educational facility near Mysore that is laid out around a columned structure Contractor designed to look like St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Vatican City. In New Delhi\u2019s D.L.F. CyberCity, Contractor constructed a sprawling office development for blue-chip companies including Microsoft, KPMG, Lufthansa and American Express. His most famous project is Hiranandani Gardens, in suburban Mumbai, not far from the airport, where Contractor designed the domestic terminal. The 250-acre mixed-use neighborhood achieved some measure of fame when it served as the backdrop for India\u2019s breakneck development in the 2008 film \u201cSlumdog Millionaire.\u201d In one of the movie\u2019s more famous scenes, a character gazes out at the neighborhood\u2019s skyline, dominated by what appear to be Greek temples stretched 33 stories into the air, and declares, \u201cIndia\u2019s at the center of the world now.\u201dThe neighborhood, named for the billionaire real-estate-developing Hiranandani brothers, certainly bears its architect\u2019s signature flamboyance. But what defines a Contractor project is the feeling that you are in a world apart. It houses more than 15,000 people and includes offices for more than 150 companies; it has its own school, its own hospital and its own recreational amenities, like Nirvana Park. All of this is supported by a vast system of backup power generators and sewage-treatment facilities that free the community from India\u2019s notoriously dysfunctional infrastructure. At Hiranandani Gardens, you can almost forget you\u2019re in a nation where 300 million people lack electricity. You certainly don\u2019t have to worry about bathroom lines. Inside Hiranandani Gardens \u2014 taking a meeting at Colgate-Palmolive, lunching at Pizza Hut \u2014 there is little, save the auto-rickshaws buzzing down Technology Street, to remind you that you\u2019re even in India. And that is precisely the point.Contractor\u2019s projects constitute a kind of alternate India, an archipelago of green zones in which Indian professionals inhabit a first world behind walls and security checkpoints, insulated from the chaos that has long hamstrung their homeland. Unlike most developing countries, India has pursued professional-services-led economic growth, opting for office parks over sweatshops. India \u201clooks like no other developing nation,\u201d the Mumbai-born pundit Fareed Zakaria has written. \u201cIndia\u2019s G.D.P. is 50 percent services, 25 percent industry and 25 percent agricultural. The only other countries that fit this profile are Portugal and Greece \u2014 middle-income countries.\u201d Contractor has found his niche in building the offices where India\u2019s professional services are produced and the residences, hotels and shopping malls where Indian professionals spend their time and money.While the world wonders whether India, under the incoming pro-market government of Narendra Modi, can return to the blistering growth rates it was consistently posting before the global financial crisis, Contractor only obliquely acknowledges that the recent sputtering of India\u2019s economy has affected his practice. Certain projects that would ideally be built quickly, he concedes, are instead being built in stages. Regardless, he prefers to look forward. The total acreage of an upscale satellite city he\u2019s currently building near Delhi (when combined with a neighboring nature preserve) \u201cwill be larger than Central Park in New York,\u201d he crowed. \u201cNow that\u2019s called creating history.\u201dTo call Hafeez Contractor Bollywood\u2019s starchitect would not do justice to his fame. He is more like a luxury brand. The entire headline on a billboard for a new housing development in Kolkata read, \u201cDesigned by the famed Hafeez Contractor.\u201d The architect does product endorsements for companies as if he were a movie star: computer makers (HP) and airlines (Swissair). When Indians talk about Contractor, they generally call him simply Hafeez.Stylistically, Contractor\u2019s buildings have no signature, save a penchant for glitz. \u201cI always say . . . that you definitely like a woman with lipstick, rouge, eyelashes,\u201d he told me. \u201cSo if you make your building more beautiful with some appliqu\u00e9s, there\u2019s nothing wrong.\u201d Instead of a style, what most unifies Contractor\u2019s projects is that they actually get built. Architecture has long been described as the most political of the arts, and the key to Contractor\u2019s success is as much his mastery of the policy levers of the world\u2019s largest democracy as his talents as a designer. Combining the skills of an architect with those of a political operative, Contractor can read new regulations and immediately find exploitable loopholes and work behind the scenes to shape legislation that serves his business. He cultivates friends in high places, and he has learned to time his public statements judiciously. \u201cThere are several good ideas that I have announced at the wrong time,\u201d Contractor told me. \u201cJust before [the] election, some party accepts it and \u2014 with good fortune or bad fortune \u2014 the other party comes, and he kills it.\u201d Most crucially, he has mastered the art of rhetoric, of phrasing his private interests in terms of the public interest.Nowhere is this more evident than in Contractor\u2019s effort to redevelop Mumbai\u2019s slums. When India became independent in 1947, only a small segment of Mumbai\u2019s population lived in shantytowns; by the 1990s, after wave upon wave of job-seeking domestic migrants arrived, roughly half the city\u2019s estimated 10 million people lived in them.Contractor had long supported a grand bargain in which developers would be given the opportunity to build market-rate projects on valuable land covered by slums in exchange for providing new, free housing for slum dwellers. He argued for such a policy in the media as well as in private conversations with politicians. In 1995, when the conservative Shiv Sena Party took power in elections in Maharashtra state (Mumbai is its capital), Contractor saw an opening. But it required cozying up to one of the least savory figures in Indian politics: Bal Thackeray, the leader of Shiv Sena and a political cartoonist by trade, who openly admired Hitler and rose to power by pitting Mumbai\u2019s ethnic groups against one another. His followers called him by the honorific Balasaheb. The local press dubbed him \u201cthe uncrowned king,\u201d because Thackeray was not an elected official but a party boss. He controlled Mumbai through a devoted following of Hindu youths that he could call upon to paralyze the metropolis with protests \u2014 or riots \u2014 if he didn\u2019t get his way.Shiv Sena came to power on a platform of \u201cfree housing for slum dwellers\u201d but lacked a concrete policy for putting it into effect. After the elections, Contractor says he set his staff to work on a comprehensive study of Mumbai\u2019s slums. His team came up with a plan to allow market-rate development of skyscrapers with extended height limits in exchange for rehousing the slum dwellers. In a closed-door meeting, Contractor recalled, he presented his proposal and got Thackeray to endorse the grand bargain over the objections of his deputies.As Contractor spoke with me, he couldn\u2019t hide his disdain for Thackeray\u2019s populist pretensions. But he had a grudging respect for his ability to get things done \u2014 specifically Contractor\u2019s own agenda. \u201cYou need a strong guy,\u201d Contractor said.Although he credits Thackeray, Contractor calls himself \u201cthe real architect of slum-redevelopment policy.\u201d It\u2019s an audacious claim, given that the policy details were worked out by a committee on which Contractor did not serve. But whatever the extent of his role, in the years since enactment, Contractor has become the go-to architect for transforming shantytowns into plots that combine low-income apartments and ultraluxury condominiums. Inside the high-rises, several million dollars buys not only granite countertops and Arabian Sea views but also electricity that never goes out and water that always runs.Given Mumbai\u2019s surreal inequality, Contractor\u2019s market-based plans have made him the architect that Indian intellectuals love to hate. P. K. Das, Mumbai\u2019s best-known radical urbanist \u2014 he is known as an architect-activist \u2014 is the nemesis of market-friendly architects like Contractor. Das rails against slum-redevelopment policy as a ruse to privatize prime plots of real estate, tarring it as the \u201cgreatest bluff ever perpetrated on the city\u2019s poor.\u201d While Contractor claims his structures, with their reliable utilities and sewage treatment, model best practices for the rest of India, critics like Das worry that giving India\u2019s most influential citizens high-quality infrastructure amid India\u2019s poverty removes the political will to make basics like reliable power and potable tap water universal. Providing basic services to the rich and not the poor bespeaks \u201ca state of underdevelopment, not a state of development,\u201d Das told me in his studio.Following the tour with Contractor of his Minerva project, we headed across town in his chauffeured white S.U.V. to have lunch at an upscale Indian chain restaurant in a shopping mall. The busy street life passing our windows \u2014 fruit sellers hawking their produce, young rag pickers filling their giant tarp sacks with scavenged recyclables, women in abayas going about their daily chores \u2014 seemed to be far removed, as if we were watching a documentary about Mumbai\u2019s poor from the comfort of a well-appointed theater. At the Jacob Circle roundabout, a teenager gunned his motor scooter the wrong direction around the one-way traffic circle, his helmetless friend hanging on tight behind him. \u201cLook at this guy!\u201d Contractor offered, more in amusement than in anger. \u201cBombay\u201d \u2014 he still calls it that \u2014 \u201chas gone wacko.\u201dHafeez was born in Mumbai in 1950, part of the Midnight\u2019s Children generation that never knew the British Raj. Despite the joys of freedom, it was an inauspicious time to be born \u2014 and not only because Hafeez\u2019s father died unexpectedly just 13 days before his birth. The family was foundering. The newborn Republic of India looked with disdain on the Contractors\u2019 industrial concerns. Private power plants would have no place in Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s state, and alcohol would be banned in Gandhi\u2019s spiritual nation.But if politics destroyed the Contractor family\u2019s fortune, under Hafeez\u2019s savvy guidance, politics would rebuild it. After barely securing a spot in architecture school, the young Hafeez excelled. His senior project was displayed at Mumbai\u2019s leading contemporary art museum, and he won a postgraduate scholarship to Columbia University, where he earned a master\u2019s in 1977. Contractor came to find Manhattan seductive, but unlike many Indian professionals, he vowed to return to India rather than use the fellowship as a ticket out. \u201cThe temptation was so great,\u201d he recalled, \u201cthat I said, \u2018Graduate in the afternoon, catch a flight in the night.\u2019 And I literally meant it. I left for my flight from the farewell dinner.\u201dIn the India he returned to, apartments meant for low-income residents were hemmed in by a square-footage limit that was part of the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act, passed while Contractor was in New York. The legislation capped some apartments at just 40 square meters (430 square feet), but nearly as soon as the regulations were enacted, Indians found a simple way to flout them: Husbands and wives would buy adjoining units and then remove a wall to combine them. That was just the first step. The race was on to come up with a design that could conjure the feel of luxury within the still-modest 860-square-foot flats.In the impeccably air-conditioned glass-and-steel sales office of the Minerva condominium tower, Contractor recalled how the Mumbai developer Kirti Kedia approached him and demanded apartments that included 10-by-14 bedrooms and 20-by-20 living rooms, straining the limits of the regulations before even considering necessities like hallways and bathrooms. \u201cI said, \u2018Come on, Kirti, I can\u2019t beat arithmetic,\u2019 \u201d Contractor recalled. \u201cKirti said, \u2018Raja\u2019 . . . he calls me Raja \u2014 raja means king \u2014 \u2018that is why I have come to you.\u2019 \u201d Contractor took out his red felt-tip pen and legal pad and showed me how he did it.Starting with the living room, Contractor drew a 20-by-20 square \u2014 400 square feet. Turning the height of the square into the diameter of a circle, a bit like Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Vitruvian Man, Contractor shaved off the top two corners. This little move cut some 40 square feet off the room. He applied the same trick to the rectangular bedrooms. \u201cAnd I got it. I beat the arithmetic. I showed him the plan the next day. . . . This was the rage of that time!\u201d Contractor had outsmarted the regulations by literally cutting corners. The result was the Megh, Malhar and Raag Towers, a set of organic-shaped buildings. The towers weren\u2019t finished until years later, but commissions for other buildings rolled in, and Hafeez became a household name. A 1987 print ad showed him standing atop his latest bullet-shaped high-rise holding airline tickets. It said simply: \u201cHafeez Contractor Flies Swissair.\u201dIn the early days of Infosys, the company was headquartered in an office building in downtown Bangalore. But Murthy saw no way to expand there. The city\u2019s transit system was hopeless. Murthy recalled telling his colleagues: \u201cLook, if we try to expand in the city, we won\u2019t have enough car parks. . . . We will create India\u2019s first software campus.\u201dContractor was initially enlisted to add \u201cshow buildings\u201d to Murthy\u2019s new Bangalore campus, including the glass pyramid television studio from which the company beams its quarterly results to the world. (Murthy told me he liked I.M. Pei\u2019s addition to the Louvre so much that he had Contractor build him one.) Soon Contractor was tasked with designing entire campuses for the company. \u201cWe fight a very tough battle here,\u201d Murthy mused. \u201cWe go through all this pollution, traffic, noise, and we reach our campus, and in a jiffy we are expected to satisfy the needs \u2014 the technological needs \u2014 of the most advanced customer from the first world all day. We have to create an environment where it becomes easier.\u201d To this end, Murthy demanded all the amenities of a large city behind the gates. \u201cIt has to have bookstores, it has to have food courts,\u201d he said, \u201cit has to have a swimming pool, it has to have a cricket pitch.\u201dAs Sadaf Khan, an Infosys communications staff member, told me bluntly when I arrived at the gates of the Bangalore headquarters: \u201cThis campus is a different world compared to the rest of the city. When you\u2019re inside the campus, you might as well not be in Bangalore.\u201dIf the goal is to conjure a \u201cdifferent world,\u201d Infosys\u2019 campuses are indisputably successful. But not everyone is happy with the results. Varun Singh, a 30-year-old middle manager, was enjoying a smoke with his team of programmers outside the gates of the company\u2019s Pune campus when he told me that employees didn\u2019t have much access to the recreational facilities, \u201cbecause we\u2019re loaded down with work.\u201d His underlings stood by nodding, impressed with his candor. Working in a chic, Contractor-designed \u201cdew drop\u201d wowed his parents when they came to visit, Singh continued, but on a day-to-day basis, the campus irked him. The location on the edge of town was inconvenient, and after the long ride from his apartment each morning on a company bus, he still had to walk a third of a mile from the campus gate to his office. (The golf cart that I traveled in, he informed me, was reserved for visiting clients and journalists.) Singh said he would prefer Infosys to operate out of a more ordinary office building in the city center. But Murthy tapped Contractor to build exurban campuses precisely because he concluded that expanding in India\u2019s dysfunctional downtowns wasn\u2019t feasible.Contractor is changing the makeup of those dysfunctional downtowns by building luxury residences alongside the slum redevelopments he advocated for with Shiv Sena. In those constructions, the two Indias sit side by side, but still painstakingly sealed off from each other. As the architect explained to me, his firm lays out the redevelopment-site plans with an eye toward keeping the slum dwellers and the condo buyers segregated. Each group is from a \u201cseparate class,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had it combined, neither the slum guys nor the prospective clients would like it.\u201dThe day after meeting Contractor, I visited the low-income housing next to the Imperial Towers. Beside the nine-story concrete parking garage that constitutes the condominiums\u2019 base, teenage boys were absorbed in their game on an improvised cricket pitch. Inside a building bearing a spray-painted mural of Bal Thackeray and other local heroes on its facade, an old man was busy at an ironing board he had set up in the stairwell as an informal laundry business. Up one flight and down the dimly lit hallway, I met the seven members of the Khan family in the 225-square-foot apartment they received after the community voted to give developers the right to build the multimillion-dollar flats.The Khans\u2019 original home had been on the footprint of the building where they live today. Back in the 1950s, the family patriarch moved to Mumbai as this community was being carved out of steep, flood-prone jungle land that nobody else wanted. Until their slum was razed, the Khans were living in a 90-square-foot hut with only corrugated metal sheets to keep out the rain.When I asked the Khans if they were satisfied with the redevelopment, every member of the family agreed enthusiastically. Even when they become eligible to sell their flat \u2014 after 10 years of residency, as mandated by the redevelopment policy \u2014 they told me they planned to stay. The access to jobs, markets and services afforded by their central location outweighs the temptation to part with their 225 square feet of Mumbai, which was worth, they estimated, $65,000.In order for a developer to secure the rights for a coveted plot, 70 percent of the shantytown\u2019s occupants have to vote in favor of that builder. Developers vie to win over influential community members, sometimes promising to sweeten the deal with add-ons. Contractor mentioned providing a free refrigerator in each unit. When I noted the rampant rumors that development companies pay cash bribes for votes, Contractor didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cEvery country has to go through this kind of a phase,\u201d he said. \u201cIn your country, it was the 1920s and 1930s.\u201dIn their apartment, however, the Khans told me that there had been only one developer making an offer for their slum and that there were no handouts. The community simply accepted the baseline offer to redevelop the parcel to the minimum standards required by the law. Contractor points out that under the law, the slum dwellers\u2019 costs are covered by the developers for 10 years. But the Khans said there were additional fees associated with the elevators and the fluorescent lighting in the common hallways. Before redevelopment, they had to pay only a 50-cent tax to the government each month; now they have to come up with nearly $9 a month. Covering that cost takes nearly every member of the Khan family pitching in to augment the $50 a month that 37-year-old Amina earns as a maid.As for Contractor\u2019s story of being thanked for 24-hour running water, the Khans told me they get running water for only one hour a day \u2014 30 minutes in the morning and another 30 minutes in the evening. When the water goes on, they fill up buckets to use for the rest of the day or night. Just next door, in the Imperial Towers penthouse (asking price: $20 million), the swimming pool is the size of seven slum-redevelopment apartments combined, and it is always full. Still, the Khans insisted, they were satisfied with this situation.Contractor sees his slum redevelopments as studies in communal harmony in which both rich and poor \u201cenjoy their own freedom, but they don\u2019t disturb the other guy\u2019s freedom.\u201d But Sheela Patel, the director of the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers, an organization that advocates for the urban poor, considers the rehousing units \u201cvertical slums.\u201d In many redevelopments, she said, \u201cthe space between the [buildings] is six feet, so the first three or four floors don\u2019t even get sunlight during the day.\u201d Patel served as the sole NGO representative on the committee that helped redesign the slum-redevelopment policy after Shiv Sena won the 1995 elections on its free-housing pledge. \u201cThis thing of 70 percent of the community agreeing to do it, that was our contribution,\u201d she said. \u201cThe developers were violently against that.\u201d But, she says, in the decades since the policy was enacted, greed and corruption have rendered it \u201cone more thing that it is done in the name of the poor but hasn\u2019t improved the quality of habitat for the poor in the sense that it was meant to be.\u201dBut critics like the Mumbai writer Naresh Fernandes dismiss Contractor\u2019s enthusiasm for market-based policy as self-serving folly. \u201cInstead of building the sort of public-housing projects that have proved effective in London, Hong Kong and Singapore,\u201d Fernandes wrote in his 2013 book, \u201cCity Adrift,\u201d \u201cMumbai decided that its housing crisis should be left to the whimsies of the private sector.\u201d As a result, only those slums located on the most desirable plots of land have proved tempting to developers. When Shiv Sena enacted the redevelopment policy, Fernandes wrote, it estimated that it would rehouse 800,000 slum dwellers. Now, nearly two decades later, it has served only 127,000.Contractor stands by the policy and insists that even his high-end projects are not exercises in excess but models of best practices. They set standards for a developed India that the government must emulate. In talking about the potable tap water on the Infosys campuses, Contractor offered: \u201cIf Infosys can do it, why can\u2019t the Bangalore city do it? Why can\u2019t the Mumbai city do it?\u201dHis voice took on a pleading tone: \u201cIf we can do it, why can\u2019t you do it?\u201dIndeed, in America\u2019s development, what began as private amenities available only to the rich \u2014 indoor plumbing, electric lighting \u2014 were eventually incorporated into public building codes and universalized. In neighboring China, the pro-market reformer Deng Xiaoping argued, \u201cLet some get rich first,\u201d and in the decades since his reign, even average Chinese have seen remarkable improvements in their living standards. Today 99 percent of Chinese have regular access to a toilet; in India, the figure is only 49 percent.Some argue that if India really is following this well-trod path of development \u2014 just with a late start \u2014 the concerns of Contractor\u2019s critics are misplaced. But China\u2019s rise out of poverty was based on an authoritarian model that is a nonstarter in democratic India. And even America\u2019s broad middle class is beginning to look like a 20th-century anomaly. Besides, Contractor\u2019s projects suggest India is on a different path altogether.India\u2019s social commentators dismiss Contractor\u2019s gaudy creations as real-life Bollywood sets. But taste aside, they are nothing to sneer at. Developments like CyberCity and Hiranandani Gardens are more than just symbols of India\u2019s rise; they are a key part of it. Inside Contractor\u2019s corporate campuses, with their private, reliable infrastructure, it\u2019s always business as usual; outside the gates, you\u2019re at the mercy of the nation that hosted the largest blackout in human history, which left 600 million people without power in 2012. When, for example, the Bangalore authorities initiate a multiday shutdown of their municipal water system for \u201cmaintenance,\u201d as they have been known to do, you can still make tea with the tap water at Infosys headquarters and get back to your spreadsheet. And by permitting Indian professionals to approximate a Western standard of living without emigrating, Contractor\u2019s residences can lure Indian executives back to world-class businesses in Mumbai and Bangalore instead of New York and Silicon Valley.Discussing the blackout, Amartya Sen told an audience in Jaipur last January that the media neglected an important fact. \u201cTwo hundred million of those 600 million people never had any power at all,\u201d he said. Equally notable, though, is the converse: That for the privileged few working on an Infosys campus or living in one of Contractor\u2019s residential compounds, the generators kicked in and the lights stayed on. The Indian poor live in perpetual darkness, and the Indian rich live in perpetual light.Sen concluded by exhorting his countrymen to \u201cstart making intelligent use of the resources that economic growth generates\u201d to close India\u2019s unconscionable social gaps. It is a sensible prescription. But it is not a politically pressing one in the world\u2019s largest democracy, because the nation\u2019s problems are no longer an issue for its most fortunate citizens. They live in a different world now, even when they are right next door.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Highways, Running on Empty", "Date": "2014-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFederal transportation funding relies heavily on user-based fees, in the form of gas taxes. While that worked for decades, it began to break down after Congress stopped raising the tax, which has been stuck at 18.4 cents a gallon for over 20 years. Since then, people have begun driving less and using more fuel-efficient cars, which means less tax is paid. Even worse, the tax is not indexed to inflation. In the past Congress has adopted a series of stopgaps to shore up the fund. But unless we reform the way we pay for transportation improvements, we will keep lurching from funding crisis to funding crisis, with our roads getting worse by the year. The only solution is to supplement the tax with dedicated federal funding \u2014 which would not only solve the money problem, but open the door to long-dreamed-of innovations in our transportation system.The obvious solution, raising the gas tax, is a political nonstarter. And even if it could pass, Congress would be tempted to direct some or all of that revenue to other purposes, like deficit reduction \u2014 it did just that in 1990 and 1993. In any case, raising the gas tax wouldn\u2019t help in the long run. When America planned the Interstate System in the 1950s, only half the country was urbanized and the number of cars was growing rapidly. Now more than 80 percent of Americans live in metropolitan regions, and total driving has stagnated. Even if we could raise the tax, it would only reinforce an outdated program.While the idea of a user fee for our highways has its appeal, it fails to capture the full role of transportation in our economy. A better transportation system can keep the costs of goods down, provide access to jobs and labor, reduce emissions and prevent fatalities and injuries. Why should users bear the cost alone when everyone enjoys the benefits?And the gas tax has all sorts of limitations \u2014 most notably a mandate that 80 percent of national transportation funds be returned directly to users, and therefore spent on highways. This inhibits expansion of other transportation modes and prevents systematic planning. And funding decisions are largely based on where gas-tax revenues are generated, rather than where we might find the greatest return on our investment. No other developed nation relies so heavily on user fees like the gas tax. While other countries typically have much higher gas taxes, they do not dedicate these revenues to transportation. Instead, they use general revenues. So should America. One option is to dedicate part of the income tax revenue that corresponds to transportation\u2019s contribution to gross domestic product, or about 10 percent (around $160 billion). Dedicating even half of that to transportation would cover America\u2019s needs and effectively align transportation with economic growth.Because they were not focused on returning money to users, both of these programs were somewhat insulated from the political forces that surround transportation funding, and were more focused on getting the federal government the maximum return on its investments.In a haphazard way, switching to a system paid for by general funds is already happening by default: We have infused the trust fund with over $55 billion in general fund revenues since 2008 (not including stimulus funding), and proposals from the president and the House of Representatives have called for $150 billion and $125 billion more, respectively, both funded through corporate tax reform. The problem with these actions and proposals is that they are one-time, short-term fixes, while transportation projects take years to complete. Effective modern transportation is less about building more highways, and more about operating our existing systems more effectively while harnessing the benefits of technology. Your commute is unlikely to improve until we pay for and invest in transportation as if it\u2019s the 21st century.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Pitti Uomo, the Age of the Natty Fellow", "Date": "2014-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFLORENCE, Italy \u2014 Maybe it was the unusual high-pressure weather system, what Kanye West called \u201ccrazy lucky weather\u201d \u2014 constant light breezes ruffling the umbrella pines, armadas of seven-story clouds sailing across the skies high above the old stones of Florence. Or maybe it was Matteo Renzi, Italy\u2019s new, young prime minister, breezing into town to deliver a $2.7 million cash infusion to Pitti and a message of Italian unity to the scores of manufacturers, 1,165 exhibitors and the many thousands of international press and buyers crowding into this fabled city for the men\u2019s wear fair Pitti Uomo. Whatever the cause, optimism was the tone of an event that, while ostensibly only a trade fair, tends to be a bellwether for the men\u2019s wear industry. 42 PhotosMuch more than seasonal trend-setting takes place at Pitti Uomo; a mood is established and for the past four days here, it has been one of optimism measured by the extent that men are dressing up again. Still digging itself out \u2014 like all fashion \u2014 from the economic doldrums and the lingering drag that casualization has had on creativity, men\u2019s wear seems on the brink of some hopeful changes. If not exactly the dawn of a sartorial Renaissance, we are quite possibly entering the Age of the Natty Fellow.He is everywhere at the Pitti enclave and throughout Florence, wearing snug trousers that show off some ankle, a lightweight cotton blazer so fitted it leaves no margin for Twinkies, shoes with proper hard soles, and most of the ensemble \u2014 shoes included \u2014 in assertive colors such as cobalt blue. Oh, and he is probably wearing a waxed mustache, a Gabriele d\u2019Annunzio beard and a straw boater. Does anyone remember Casual Friday? Hoodies and sneakers? Mark Zuckerberg? The inexorable march of heritage brands and artisanal everything has had an unexpectedly affirmative effect on men\u2019s dressing \u2014 or anyway it has among the early adopters one finds here. The Natty Fellow\u2019s style is a visual amalgam of \u201cMad Men,\u201d the New York retailer Freemans Sporting Club and Joe E. Brown in \u201cSome Like It Hot.\u201d That the Natty Fellow himself is likely too young to recognize two out of three of those references matters little. What he doesn\u2019t know, Google Image will provide. 18 PhotosAs a result, all kinds of seemingly anachronistic trades were highlighted here. Traditional shoemakers from the English county of Northamptonshire made a strong showing. So, too, did Neapolitan perfumers, Sicilian barbers, venerable Swedish shirtmakers. Even the producers of a special Japanese shoe polish showed up at Pitti, bringing along a shoeshine expert, Hiroaki Mitsuhashi, to demonstrate how he achieves a softly lustrous shine by buffing with the palm of his hand. At a pop-up barbershop installed by the century-old barber supply company Proraso in the fair\u2019s main pavilion, a heavily tattooed Roman barber named Cosimo Di Gorga applied hot towels to volunteers before cleaning up their whiskers with his straight razor. As it happened, few of the takers were smooth-cheeked, lavish growths of facial hair being another notable Pitti Uomo trend.Behind the apparent quaintness of all that revivalism there is real local and global economic significance: \u201cOne by one, the lights are going back on in little factories,\u201d said Alison Hargreaves, head of publicity for Grenson shoes, whose booth at the Touch pavilion was crowded with buyers drawn to newly reimagined classics that appeal to influencers like Nickelson Wooster, the Instagram style hero known in the blogosphere as the WoostGod. \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m obsessed with them,\u201d he said. A generation that grew up wearing jeans and sneakers has some catching up to do, according to Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W magazine and curator of a specially commissioned installation at Pitti Uomo titled \u201cDe\u2019 (Millennials) Costumi.\u201d \u201cThe codes are being rewritten,\u201d said Mr. Tonchi, whose exhibit took as its inspiration a timeless book of etiquette for young men, created in the 16th century by the Florentine Giovanni Della Casa. \u201cFirst you learn the rules and then you can break them,\u201d Mr. Tonchi added. \u201cWell, maybe not all the rules: Signore Della Casa said, \u2018Don\u2019t stick your hands in places you keep covered.\u201d\u2019 Advice like that has lost no relevance since it was written. Fascinating things happen where rules are torqued, when rote codes meet innovation. Take the capsule collection that Pharrell Williams\u2019s Bionic Yarn created in a partnership with G-Star RAW jeans. Using fibers spun from recycled plastic waste gathered from the world\u2019s oceans, they produced jeans that both look cool (Mr. Williams\u2019s Otto the Octopus logo is incorporated subtly into the weave) and help humans \u201ccome together for Big Blue,\u201d as Mr. Williams noted in a written statement. Consider another capsule collection, this one generated by the pairing of Kazumasa Kobayashi, designer of a Japanese cult bicycle and bike wear, and Spiewak, a 110-year-old U.S. label founded to provide stevedores on the Brooklyn waterfront with work clothes and now owned by a Swiss company. From that collaboration came a gunmetal gray bomber jacket detailed with such precision that its zippered front opens to reveal an inner zippered half lining of mesh, a way of keeping covered and ventilated as you fly around the city on your fixed-gear bike. \u201cYou know, there is more humor in physics than fashion,\u201d said Sebastian Dollinger, the 30-year-old designer for Eton, a Swedish shirtmaker founded in 1928. Mr. Dollinger was referring his own humorous approach to such stodgy notions as a neutral, \u201cmasculine\u201d palette. \u201cI wanted to have a lot of color\u201d in the collection, he said of shirts patterned with the Eton version of the Mod micro-florals seen everywhere at the fair. \u201cFlowers are an easy and fun way to use a lot of colors and maybe make people smile.\u201d No one at Pitti Uomo confused playfulness for a lack of seriousness; food, furniture and fashion account for nearly a third of Italy\u2019s export economy. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because of Renzi,\u201d said Raffaello Napoleone, the show\u2019s innovative chief executive and an increasingly important figure in Italian fashion, referring to the country\u2019s dynamic young prime minister, formerly the mayor of Florence. \u201cBut our exhibitor and attendance numbers are up substantially over last year, so we are sensing a mood of optimism.\u201d That Pitti Uomo provides a forum not just for industry heavy-hitters but also for tiny niche brands, startups and unlikely collaborations is a large part of its appeal to the thousands of international buyers who descended on Florence, filling its restaurants and driving up hotel prices. \u201cI love Milan,\u201d said a buyer for a prominent retailer, referring to the men\u2019s wear shows beginning Saturday in that city. \u201cBut at Pitti you see the trends in real clothes real guys are actually going to wear.\u201dYou see designers such as Matteo Gioli and Veronica Cornacchini, two young hatters that got into the business by apprenticing themselves to traditional Florentine milliners. \u201cWe started making hats for ourselves and then for our friends and then the friends of friends,\u201d said Ms. Cornacchini. And now Super Duper hats are sold at Barneys New York.Their best seller, the Hobo Hat, is as good an example as any of the prevalent spirit of adaptive reuse. \u201cWe thought it was boring that the only hats you could find for traveling were rolling hats,\u201d said Mr. Gioli. Consulting vintage images of the itinerant railway track-layers known as gandy dancers, the partners came up with a hat intentionally designed to be squashed, its rumpled crown part of the charm. Consistent with a spirit of cross-pollination that has characterized Mr. Napoleone\u2019s tenure as head of Pitti, certain Super Duper styles come lined with Japanese high tech fabric, introduced to the pair by fellow exhibitors from a label called Norwegian Rain. \u201cIn Norway, it rains two days out of three,\u201d explained T-Michael, a former tailor who designs this line of elegantly severe raincoats. \u201cWe met Matteo and Veronica at Pitti and thought that meshing their Florentine tenderness with Norwegian functionalism would be a brilliant idea.\u201dAnd it is.

{"Headline": "Honolulu Shores Up Tourism With Crackdown on Homeless", "Date": "2014-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONOLULU \u2014 It was just before 7 a.m. and the streets of Waikiki were filled with tourists, surfers, early morning joggers \u2014 and Ronnie Cruz, a 34-year-old homeless man getting a ticket from a Honolulu police officer for pushing a shopping cart piled high with his belongings along the sidewalk.\u201cHappens all the time,\u201d Mr. Cruz said after he made his way to the other side of Kalakaua Avenue. \u201cThey won\u2019t let you stand over there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got four of them,\u201d he said, reaching into a billfold as he displayed the tattered tickets.This tourist mecca has had a surge in its homeless population, which is up 32 percent over the past five years. The explosion has prompted one of the toughest police crackdowns in the nation, sounded alarms among civic leaders that aggressive panhandlers are scaring off tourists, and set off an anguished debate on how to deal with the destitute in a state that prides itself on its friendly and easygoing ways.Honolulu officials say they are confiscating up to 10 tons of property left on the sidewalk by homeless people every week.\u201cIt\u2019s time to declare a war on homelessness, which is evolving into a crisis in Honolulu,\u201d Mayor Kirk Caldwell, a Democrat, wrote in a provocative essay that appeared in The Honolulu Star-Advertiser this month. \u201cWe cannot let homelessness ruin our economy and take over our city.\u201dIn an interview in his City Hall offices, Mr. Caldwell said that many of the homeless are people who were drawn here from the mainland by the promise of balmy weather, only to encounter some of the highest housing costs in the nation and no family nearby to help them through tough times.In addition to seizing the belongings of homeless people, Honolulu is closing public parks at night and banning tents and lean-tos in public spaces. The City Council last week began debating legislation that would authorize the police to roust anyone found lying or sleeping on a sidewalk or in a public space; a second law would impose fines of up to $1,000, or 30 days in jail, for public urination or defecation in the beachfront neighborhood of Waikiki. The council also authorized a $47 million program to create low-cost housing.\u201cIt is generally true in sunshine tourist states that there is a war going on between tourism and development versus helping the homeless,\u201d said Michael Stoops, director of community organizing for the National Coalition for the Homeless.But the stakes here are particularly high because the Hawaiian economy is so dependent on tourism. Mr. Caldwell said he had received letters from tourists complaining about run-ins with homeless people, and had responded with notes asking them to give the city another chance.The crackdown has led to what many people say is a noticeable reduction in the homeless population in Waikiki. But despite what officials say is a concerted attempt to place the homeless into housing, they acknowledge the steps taken so far have simply displaced many people to parts of Oahu that are off the tourist track.\u201cWe\u2019re so sleep-deprived, we\u2019re running around,\u201d said Bill Garcia, 51, who has been living on the streets of Waikiki since coming from Los Angeles in search of a job. \u201cWe ask them, \u2018Where do you want us to go?\u2019 and they just say, \u2018Get out of Waikiki.\u2019 \u201dHonolulu\u2019s Chinatown, just five miles from Waikiki, was flooded with homeless people the other evening. People were lying on the sidewalk, some barely dressed. One man in a tattered shirt wandered in the street. A third recognized Gov. Neil Abercrombie as he emerged from a restaurant and asked him for some change. Mr. Abercrombie reached into his pocket and gave the man a dollar bill.Mr. Caldwell said Honolulu was trying to find sensitive ways to deal with the problem, and pointed to the city\u2019s investment in housing. But he acknowledged the efforts have fallen short.\u201cWe haven\u2019t eliminated the visual impact of homelessness,\u201d Mr. Caldwell said. \u201cWhen visitors come here, they want to see their paradise. They don\u2019t want to see homeless people sleeping in parks or on sidewalks or on the beach.\u201dHe continued, \u201cI want to do this in a constitutional way, a human way, but I want to do it. We need to do it. I call it compassionate disruption \u2014 we are not doing it without heart.\u201dMike McCartney, the president of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, said Honolulu was motivated not only by tourism concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s an island issue and a social issue that everyone is committed to addressing,\u201d he said.\u201cI think we are doing it with aloha,\u201d he said, using the Hawaiian word that connotes compassion. \u201cBut doing it with aloha doesn\u2019t mean you are not going to be firm. It doesn\u2019t mean you are not going to be aggressive. It doesn\u2019t mean you are going to tolerate things that you can\u2019t tolerate.\u201dJerry Jones, the executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said the crackdown in Honolulu was \u201cas bad as we\u2019ve seen it recently.\u201d He said Mr. Caldwell\u2019s \u201ccompassionate disruption\u201d was \u201ca pretentious phrase to dress up an ugly policy \u2014 sending the police to round up poor people isn\u2019t compassionate.\u201dHe added, \u201cHave we gotten so far out of touch with reality that our first reaction to people experiencing destitution is that it spoils our view of the beach?\u201dMr. Cruz, who received the ticket in Waikiki, said he came here from California drawn by the promise of a job that never materialized, and soon found himself living on the street. He said his identification had been confiscated, so he has no way to fly home \u2014 even if he had the money to do so.\u201cNow I can\u2019t get back,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t get a job.\u201dJohn McCormick, 55, who can be found most days reciting Scripture on the streets of Waikiki, said he now avoids sleeping there to avoid the police. He, too, scoffed at the mayor\u2019s description of this policy.\u201cHe\u2019s not making a war on homelessness,\u201d Mr. McCormick said. \u201cHe\u2019s making a war against the homeless.\u201dAn article on Monday about homelessness in Hawaii misspelled the surname, at one point, of a man living on the street who criticized the mayor\u2019s treatment of the homeless.

Lawmakers are loath to cross them.Younger voters need to assert themselves. Perhaps they\u2019re poised to do just that.

And I\u2019ve noticed more bulletins and agitating from organizations like Generation Opportunity, which crunched May\u2019s employment figures to confirm a much higher rate of joblessness among Americans ages 18 to 29 than among the whole population.We millennial bashers of course have our stock responses to that. We quibble with the college majors that millennials choose. We question their willingness to hunt for work outside their comfort zones.We conveniently overlook how much more they\u2019ve had to pay for college than we did, the loans they\u2019ve racked up and the fact that nothing explains their employment difficulties better than a generally crummy economy, which certainly isn\u2019t their fault.They get our derision when they deserve our compassion and a political selflessness we\u2019ve been unable to muster. While we\u2019re at it, we might even want to murmur an apology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Best of Both Worlds? Northeast Cut Emissions and Enjoyed Growth", "Date": "2014-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEnvironmental IngenuityOne of the ways that states will be able to meet the new E.P.A. standards is by joining a Northeastern cap-and-trade program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which first put in a carbon cap in 2009. In a cap-and-trade system, the government places a ceiling on total carbon emissions and issues permits for those emissions, which companies can buy and sell from one another.The nine states already in the program \u2014 Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont \u2014 have substantially reduced their carbon emissions in recent years. At the same time, those states have had stronger economic growth than the rest of the country.Historically, the demand for electricity was closely tied to growth in the economy; only recently have the two decoupled.These nine states had large emissions drops even before the program began in 2009, in part because the recession and warmer winters lowered the demand for power. The states also began switching to natural gas power, retiring coal units, and adding wind and solar energy generation. As the economy recovered, participation in the program spurred the states to find ways to meet the increasing demand for power without driving up emissions.Since 2009, the nine states have cut their emissions by 18 percent, while their economies grew by 9.2 percent. By comparison, emissions in the other 41 states fell by 4 percent, while their economies grew by 8.8 percent.Capping carbon emissions could still slow economic growth, and it is possible that the nine states that joined the cap-and-trade program would have had even better economic growth without the program. These states have more nuclear and natural-gas energy in their portfolios than do many other states; other states that depend primarily on coal power may not be able to reduce emissions as swiftly.But the results in the nine states suggest that the effect of the cap-and-trade program on growth was, at most, modest. The sharp cut in emissions in the Northeast did not prevent the economy there from doing just as well as elsewhere.Joining the Northeast cap-and-trade program, or another similar program in California that began in 2013, is one of many ways states can reach the new goals the E.P.A. has set. Other options include taking a series of individual steps \u2014 such as upgrading older power plants and expanding nuclear, wind and solar power generation \u2014 without a statewide cap. The states themselves will decide exactly how they will meet the goals set for them.Economists have long praised cap-and-trade programs, compared with detailed mandates from regulators, because they create a market in which businesses are responsible for finding the cheapest way to comply with the regulation. Businesses that devise less expensive ways to reduce pollution can sell their permits to those that cannot change their habits so easily.Hannah Fairfield is\na senior graphics\neditor at The New\nYork Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "All in the Famiglia", "Date": "2014-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn \u201cBlood Brotherhoods,\u201d the British scholar John Dickie sets himself the wildly ambitious task of writing the histories of Italy\u2019s three major criminal organizations from their origins in the mid-19th century to the present. The result is a book that is alternately impressive and infuriating. Dickie has amassed and digested an astonishing mass of material (tens of thousands of pages of trial documents, newspaper accounts and secondary literature) and followed scores of different characters (bandits, crime bosses, policemen, judges, politicians) in disparate places across a 150-year span. And yet he has managed, despite the girth and diversity, to sustain an argument and a story. He entertains the reader with dozens of fascinating figures \u2014 both noble and blood-chilling \u2014 while making frequently shrewd judgments that place this story in context, as a central feature of Italian life.At the same time, Dickie, in his attempt to give coherence to so much material, makes overly grand claims about the essential unity of Italy\u2019s various crime groups. If he had shortened his book by 20 percent, reduced the rhetorical temperature by 20 degrees and scaled back some of his more ambitious assertions, one would be left with an extremely valuable history of Italian organized crime.The Mafia in Italy, Dickie argues, is a modern and not \u2014 as many believe \u2014 an ancient phenomenon. In the wake of Italian unification, with the fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (the Bourbon monarchy based in Naples), the conditions for incubating a new and dangerous form of organized crime were created in Southern Italy \u2014 much as they were in Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Key ingredients were the collapse of public order, the proliferation of new opportunities for rapid enrichment, the lack of credible institutions to provide basic protections and the presence of violent entrepreneurs ready to take advantage. The introduction of democracy, as Dickie points out, was also important: Powerful crime bosses could be useful in drumming up electoral support, intimidating political opponents, helping to control small-time criminals and sharing illicit profits with corrupt politicians. While a dictatorship or an absolute monarchy could arrest and execute known criminals with little or no proof, the legal procedures of democratic Italy offered many opportunities for the new class of criminals to use powerful connections to achieve a measure of impunity. The failure to understand this, Dickie argues, allowed a much more insidious form of organized crime to insinuate itself into all levels of Southern Italian life, becoming a kind of \u201cstate within the state,\u201d draining the region of resources and keeping much of it in a condition of semipermanent underdevelopment.This part of Dickie\u2019s argument \u2014 while not new \u2014 is perfectly sound and forcefully illustrated. But he goes on to make bigger, bolder and much less supported claims. He stresses that these Mafia groups are secret fraternities, with initiation rituals and codified rules, some of which have been consistent over time and are found in different variations throughout Sicily, Calabria and Campania (the region surrounding Naples). This constitutes proof, in Dickie\u2019s view, that the three main Italian Mafias \u2014 Sicily\u2019s Cosa Nostra, the Neapolitan Camorra and Calabria\u2019s \u2019Ndrangheta \u2014 have been continuous and unified over a 150-year period, and that the three groups are different faces of what is essentially the same organization. Dickie frequently uses the rather odd term \u201cHonored Society\u201d to refer to a single criminal fraternity that links all three regional groups. In fact, Italian prosecutors (in all the recent cases I am familiar with) never use this term, and treat the three main crime groups as distinct organizations with varying and often changing degrees of centralization. In all three organizations, individual Mafia clans have considerable autonomy, and are often in rivalrous \u2014 and sometimes murderous \u2014 competition with one another. To reach a wider audience, Dickie has dressed up his story in the language of true-crime literature. The book (especially the first half) is full of phrases like \u201ca dungeon\u2019s sepulchral gloom,\u201d \u201csilent howl of rage,\u201d \u201cwrithing in excruciating pain,\u201d \u201csinister subplot,\u201d \u201cthick with intrigue.\u201d On a deeper level, Dickie has chosen to fill most of his 660 pages with stories of ghoulish criminality, grisly murders and courageous but doomed police officers at the expense of larger historical context.Dickie dedicates an entire chapter to the bloody deeds of Giuseppe Musolino, a Calabrian bandit who went on a killing spree and eluded the Italian police for four years before being arrested in 1901 and tried the following year. He writes that one police investigator, Vincenzo Mangione, concluded that Musolino\u2019s family were founding members of a Mafia group in his hometown, Santo Stefano. \u201cIn other words, the evidence collected by Mangione, together with the fact that Musolino was able to rely on a regionwide support network, strongly indicated that the \u2019Ndrangheta has always been a single organization, and not a ragtag ensemble of village gangs.\u201d This seems a wild overinterpretation based on very scant evidence. It is far easier to believe that Musolino\u2019s ability to elude the police in the Aspromonte mountains had much more to do with a deeply ingrained distrust of authority among Calabrian peasants and their lack of identification with the new Italian state than with the omnipotence of a secret criminal organization.For Dickie, the initiation rituals he emphasizes are the key. At one point, he tells us that in 1876: \u201cThe Italian government discovered the most important piece of evidence in the entire history of Sicilian organized crime. The Palermo police chief wrote to the minister of the interior to describe, for the first time, the initiation ritual used by Mafiosi in a settlement in the Conca d\u2019Oro.\u201d The failure to grasp the importance of this discovery, Dickie writes, led to \u201ca century of bloodshed.\u201dBut this infatuation with initiation rituals and individual stories results in a fundamental misunderstanding of the Mafia phenomenon. Criminal bands with considerable organization and networks of solidarity existed in early modern England \u2014 as well as in many other parts of Europe. But most of them disappeared in the 17th and 18th centuries as the central state asserted itself and eliminated most forms of private violence. This process of state formation did not happen in Italy until the mid-19th century and was highly incomplete in Southern Italy. Mafia-type groups thrive in places where there is a power vacuum \u2014 in countries with weak states like Mexico, Colombia and post-Soviet Russia, or among isolated and homogeneous immigrant populations as in Italian, Irish and Jewish neighborhoods in early-20th-century America. We have seen the same thing more recently in inner-city neighborhoods where local residents fear drug lords more than they do the police. Gangs like the Crips, the Bloods and the Latin Kings have rituals, recognizable dress and secret codes that are quite similar to those of the Southern Italian Mafias. The rituals and codes of behavior serve a double function: They enforce solidarity, and they serve as a powerful \u201cbrand\u201d to the outside world. The knowledge that a particular person is a Mafioso or a gang leader is often enough to gain someone\u2019s cooperation without firing a shot.The big issue, then, is not why the Italian police did not understand the importance of initiation rituals but rather why the Italian state did not extend its control throughout Southern Italy. As thorough as it is, \u201cBlood Brotherhoods\u201d would have served its subject better by devoting less space to gruesome misdeeds and more to Italy\u2019s thorny \u201cSouthern question\u201d \u2014 the failure to establish both rule of law and a normal economy there \u2014 leaving space for this murderous \u201cstate within a state.\u201d BLOOD BROTHERHOODSA History of Italy\u2019s Three MafiasBy John DickieIllustrated. 748 pp. PublicAffairs. $35.Alexander Stille is a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism and the author, among other books, of \u201cExcellent Cadavers: The Mafia and the Death of the First Italian Republic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Residents had been watching a match at the Breeze View Hotel when the attackers took aside some of the men and gunned them down in front of the women.The authorities said that gunmen emerged from two minibuses before starting the assault, in which at least one police officer was killed.

{"Headline": "Turning From Europe\u2019s Past", "Date": "2014-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Europe is covered in monuments to wars with invaders, neighbors and ourselves, and littered with peace treaties that failed. Thursday\u2019s meeting of the European Union\u2019s leaders in Ypres, the Flemish town that became a synonym for the slaughter in World War I a century ago, may take on an additional symbolic burden. Ypres might become a footnote in the story of the union\u2019s great unraveling \u2014 the place where, after more than 60 years of peace, our leaders underestimated a threat, and gambled with the lives of millions. It\u2019s essential to understand history, but more crucial to know where we stand today, to grasp the importance of decisions we will make. The European Union started out as a framework for cooperation among six coal- and steel-producing countries \u2014 France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg \u2014 with the Treaty of Paris in 1951, less than six years after their latest efforts to dominate one another. It was successful beyond all dreams. In Ypres on Thursday and in Brussels on Friday, the leaders of 28 countries will discuss issues ranging from economic growth, competitiveness and job creation to the dangers stemming from the crises in Ukraine and (presumably) Iraq. They will also consider candidates for top jobs in the European Union\u2019s institutions. What they should focus on, though, is how to keep the union intact as it confronts the greatest problems in its history.How will members be competitive in the global economy without provoking political fragmentation? Will Britain remain? How will a weakened France affect the balance of power at the union\u2019s core? When will policies reflect clear priorities rather than ambivalence and narrow national interests? Can the leaders focus on the principle that their nations\u2019 prosperity depends on a successful union just as much as the union depends on each country\u2019s contribution? How will governments share power with European Union institutions without either side\u2019s losing legitimacy? Will the union ever manage to marshal the total of its power in terms of people and wealth?Britain\u2019s drift toward the exit is another crippling problem. One of the pillars of postwar Europe, with its often contrarian but fruitful ideas, its aggressive trading and its strong military, it contributed decisively to the European Union\u2019s strength. Now it is trapped by Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s tactics. In trying to outmaneuver British euroskeptics by proposing a referendum on continued membership by the end of 2017, his calls for a looser union have come across as desperate and dangerous \u2014 especially when the clearest lesson of the economic crisis has been the need for closer cooperation. Mr. Cameron faces a dilemma: press on, regardless of the damage to Britain\u2019s position in the European Union, or back down and seal his political fate at home. The muddled compromises that so often allowed the union to stumble onward will not work. A more immediate problem is France\u2019s loss of stature and influence. The cooperation between France and Germany, the Continent\u2019s two most powerful countries and age-old rivals, was the reason the union was born, and has been its driving force. Fearing the social and political cost of reform, France grows weaker, leaving wealthy Germany as the European Union\u2019s undisputed leader. This contradicts the principle of a union of equals working for the common good, and opens the way for opportunistic alliances at the expense of the whole. History is full of alliances that turned into empires. The crisis has strengthened Berlin\u2019s position. Loss of competitiveness in other countries, capital flight toward the safe haven of Germany and a (relatively) weaker euro have resulted in Germany\u2019s being flooded with cheap money at the expense of other members. But Germany\u2019s policies have often been shortsighted. And the European Central Bank, the only institution that appears focused on saving the common currency and the European Union as a whole, has couched its policies in vague language, and so avoided bumping up against Germany\u2019s fiscal disciplinarianism. Clearly, years of raising taxes while cutting spending and incomes do not lead to recovery, as we have seen in Greece. Yet the union pressed on with this policy until it appeared that Italy and Spain would follow Greece, Ireland and Portugal in needing bailouts from their partners and the International Monetary Fund. European Central Bank promises, not German policies, stopped the domino effect. (Some countries are too big to rescue, while others are too big to censure: In 2003, the European Union held off on an investigation into German and French finances when the two ran up large deficits.)Greece has an intimate view of the European Union\u2019s strengths and failings. Without our partners\u2019 help, we would have collapsed. With their know-how, we are reforming the economy and the public administration as we struggle with deflation, unemployment at nearly 27 percent, unsustainable debt and increasing numbers of people unable to pay their taxes and loans, while the political system fragments. New European Union mechanisms, like a banking union, a more active European Central Bank and the push for greater flexibility in fiscal and monetary policy, suggest that the focus can now be on survival and growth. The crisis forced the European Union to make great strides, yet there still seems to be a lack of leadership and direction.The union\u2019s survival is too important to be left to politicians whose primary concern is re-election. It needs ideas. Perhaps it is time to call in the dreamers, intellectuals, academics, entrepreneurs, pensioners, workers and unemployed from all corners of the union, even from beyond its borders. We need a grand convention on the future of what is, above all, a beacon of humanity. Something like a peace conference without a war. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Chaos, Iraq\u2019s Kurds See a Chance to Gain Ground", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIRKUK, Iraq \u2014 The chair Col. Imad Muhammad sat in belonged to a commander in the Iraqi Army. So did the tiny cup from which he was drinking his tea, the ashtray where he snuffed out his cigarettes and the Ping-Pong table and treadmill outside his office.Colonel Muhammad is an officer in the pesh merga, the Kurdish security forces who have occupied an air base, once home to the American military and then the Iraqi government, here in Kirkuk. In doing so, they claimed for the Kurds a divided city that many of them regard as their spiritual homeland. It is rich in oil, too, which could accelerate the Kurds\u2019 longstanding drive for economic independence and eventual statehood.But as he spoke in an interview this week, subordinates kept rushing into the room, their urgency helping explain why the Kurds, for the most part, have not celebrated yet: There is still too much uncertainty, too much fighting ahead.Earlier in the day, Colonel Muhammad sent a unit to defend a Kurdish village on the rural outskirts of Kirkuk that had come under attack by Sunni militants. His fighters were facing tough resistance; they needed backup and asked for heavier arms, big truck-mounted weapons that fire armor-piercing rounds.\u201cThere are dangerous days ahead, and more fighting,\u201d he said.By every measure, the Sunni militants\u2019 lightning advance through Mosul and on south toward Baghdad has been a disaster for Iraq. But it raises possibilities, many of them good ones, for the Kurds, who already have a great deal of autonomy in the north. If they can defend their borders and not get dragged into a bloody stalemate between the Iraqi Army, along with its Shiite militia allies, and the Sunni militants, the Kurds could emerge empowered, even, perhaps, with their centuries-old dream of their own state fulfilled.As the Sunni militants seek to erase the border between Iraq and Syria that the colonial powers drew after World War I, the Kurds want to draw a new one, around a stretch of territory across northern Iraq. The ultimate goal is even more ambitious: to unite the Kurdish minorities from four countries \u2014 Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran.For now, Kurdish officials say they are still part of Iraq, but they claim it is their right to be independent if they choose.\u201cI call it Iraq, pre- and post-Mosul,\u201d said Fuad Hussein, the chief of staff to Masoud Barzani, the president of the autonomous Kurdish region. \u201cIt\u2019s two different periods. For us, it is a new situation, a different era.\u201dHe added, \u201cUntil this moment, as I\u2019m talking to you, we are committed to the Constitution of Iraq.\u201dBut how much longer that commitment lasts is the question.With Kirkuk, the events have appeared to resolve, for better or worse, one of the thorniest problems the Americans tried, and failed, to resolve: whether the city belonged to the central government or the Kurdish region. Now that the Kurds are fully in control here, they say they will never give it up, a position that could presage a new conflict should Iraqi government forces return.Najmaldin Karim, the governor of Kirkuk, is trying to manage the crisis, consolidating Kurdish control but reaching out to the city\u2019s other groups, mainly Sunni Arabs and Turkmens. He also needs to maintain good relations with the central government because Iraq has essentially one source of revenue, oil, which is controlled by Baghdad and parceled out to the provinces. He said the government promised to keep the money coming for now, and that means he can keep paying local police officers to secure the city.Mr. Karim, who holds American citizenship and once lived in Maryland, working as a neurosurgeon \u2014 he was in the emergency room when President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981 \u2014 is firm about not letting Kirkuk revert to its uncertain status as a divided city. But he also maintains that Arabs and Turkmens will \u201chave to have a say in this.\u201d\u201cThe whole of Iraq cannot go back to the way it was before, not only Kirkuk,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever was done since 2003 has not worked.\u201dEfforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.Kirkuk holds a prominent place in the collective Kurdish consciousness, not only for its oil but also because it is a historical place of suffering for Kurds. In the late 1990s under Saddam Hussein\u2019s Baath Party, nearly a quarter of a million Kurds were displaced from the city and replaced with Arabs, part of the government\u2019s so-called Arabization policy.But Kirkuk\u2019s minorities are already on edge. \u201cWe are scared now for our city because after 10 years we have turned back to the zero point,\u201d said Mijbel Adbulrahman, a 52-year-old Arab. \u201cWe have turned back to the conflict between Arabs and Kurds.\u201dEven before this crisis, the Kurds, with their own security forces, diplomats and a booming economy, were steadily moving toward independence by securing deals with Turkey and international companies to pump oil out of the region, without the approval of Baghdad. Baghdad and the United States regarded those deals as illegal, contending that any oil within Iraq belongs to the nation, not to a part of it.But the Kurds pushed on anyway, and two tanker ships filled with Kurdish oil are sailing around the Mediterranean Sea, having left in recent weeks from a port in Turkey, but with nowhere to dock because of threats of legal action by Washington and Baghdad.Before the seizure of Mosul, preventing that oil from hitting international markets had been a centerpiece of Washington\u2019s Iraq policy for the past two years, and American officials had believed that the sale of Kurdish oil, without Baghdad getting its cut, was a greater threat to the cohesion of Iraq than surging militants in Syria who had their sights set on bringing the fight to this country.Now, however, Baghdad is focused more on the Kurds\u2019 renowned battlefield prowess and how the pesh merga can help turn back the militants\u2019 thrust. Falih al-Fayadh, Mr. Maliki\u2019s national security adviser, said in a news conference recently that the central government was working with the Kurds, calling the fight against the militants a \u201cjoint battle.\u201dBut Jabar Yawar, the spokesman for the pesh merga, said: \u201cIt is all talk. We have a relationship, but there is no cooperation.\u201d The Kurds\u2019 interests lie in expanding their territory to take in all the predominantly Kurdish areas of Iraq, while mostly keeping out of the larger fight.Mr. Yawar laid out a map that showed the expanding positions of Kurdish forces in Iraq, across an area stretching from the Syrian border in the west to the Iranian border in the east. The territory along a blue line, much of which the Kurds previously controlled jointly with the Iraqi Army, is now theirs, after Iraqi soldiers either deserted or fled south toward Baghdad.A red line shows areas where the pesh merga moved forward, in Diyala Province in the east, to take over cities that were formerly disputed between the Kurds and Baghdad, and in the west, where in recent days they took a border crossing with Syria.Mr. Yawar showed where the pesh merga are and where he believes the militant groups are positioned, and he said he gave the same presentation in recent days to officials from the American government, which is considering airstrikes to stop the militants\u2019 advance.He said that statehood would be determined by the international community, and that Turkey and Iran, because they share borders, would have to consent. That is a long shot, given that both Turkey and Iran have sizable Kurdish populations, whose ambitions for independence could be inflamed if a Kurdish state were carved from Iraq.Even if statehood does not immediately beckon, the Kurds have been emboldened in other ways by the chaos gripping the country. For example, with a professional and loyal security force, they could reach a security pact with Baghdad in exchange for concessions in the dispute over oil, accelerating the drive for economic independence.But they are fighting for their own borders, which are shifting and not exactly clear. On any given day, they might be fighting the Sunni extremist group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS; other militant Sunni groups; or tribal gunmen.Back at the air base Tuesday afternoon, the backup unit readied itself, stuffing body armor plates into vests, checking weapons and getting those big guns ready on its pickup trucks.\u201cWe are going to the front line to kill ISIS people,\u201d one soldier said.Another corrected him. \u201cIt\u2019s not ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the tribe over there.\u201dBryan Denton and an employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Kirkuk, and Suadad al-Salhy from Baghdad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats See Winning Issue in Carbon Plan", "Date": "2014-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 He is a Democrat in a marquee Senate race, pressed by a strong Republican in a state with a challenging political environment. So when a new proposal to limit power plant emissions was seen as posing a threat to allies of the Obama administration, Senator Mark Udall of Colorado acted quickly: He embraced the plan.The E.P.A. proposal to reduce carbon pollution from power plants was deemed a political gift from the Obama administration to Republicans running for Senate seats in the coal-producing states of Kentucky and West Virginia, and an anchor around the necks of their Democratic opponents. Elsewhere, the threat of higher electricity bills and Republican attacks about another federal power grab were supposed to send Democrats scurrying for cover and distance from the White House.But Mr. Udall\u2019s example shows that not all Democrats look at it that way.In Iowa, Representative Bruce Braley, the Democratic Senate nominee, has adopted the same approach as Mr. Udall. \u201cReducing our carbon output is not only necessary for the health of the planet, it\u2019s an opportunity to continue to improve the health of the Iowa economy \u2014 which is and will remain my No. 1 priority,\u201d Mr. Braley said.In other states with competitive Senate races, such as Michigan, Democrats say growing public support for action to curb climate change \u2014 coupled with pronouncements by Republican candidates that human activity is not contributing to it, or their denials that the world is growing warmer \u2014 could help Democrats this year. They say it will definitely make the party stronger heading into the 2016 presidential election.\u201cDenying the existence of climate change is proving to be a problem for many Republicans right now, and certainly a long-term albatross for the party,\u201d said Matt Canter, the deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cRepublican efforts to squeeze political gain out of this have fallen short.\u201dRepublicans scoff at that notion. They say the new proposal has given Republican Senate contenders in Kentucky and West Virginia a huge advantage despite concerted efforts by Democrats there to distance themselves from the president and his plan. Republicans say it has also provided a handicap for Democrats running in energy-supplying states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana and Virginia.\u201cFive months prior to the most difficult election of their careers, President Obama is turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to their concerns,\u201d the National Republican Senatorial Committee said in a statement. \u201cAn uphill climb just got even more difficult.\u201dBut Democrats say that public polling shows broad acceptance of the need to combat climate change and that some recent surveys show large majorities support the idea of emission limits on power plants.\u201cDemocrats will welcome the opportunity to use this to talk about the Republicans\u2019 dependence on oil company interests and other special interests that oppose carbon regulation for the sake of their own profits,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who conducted a survey in Virginia this week for an environmental group.In Colorado, which produces both fossil fuels and renewable energy, the political dynamic is much different from the one in coal states. Colorado has moved ahead with its own emissions standards, and Mr. Udall\u2019s Republican opponent, Representative Cory Gardner, voted for a plan similar to the federal proposal while serving in the state legislature.\u201cIn 2010, Democrats and Republicans in the state worked together knowing that any product we produced would meet Colorado\u2019s needs far better than any unelected E.P.A. bureaucrat\u2019s plan,\u201d Mr. Gardner said in a statement. The fight in Colorado is more likely to be about hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for natural gas, and Mr. Gardner has focused on pressuring Mr. Udall over efforts to impose local government restrictions on the process.The idea that Democrats in swing states outside the coal belt can capitalize on the emissions rules still seems a difficult proposition to some analysts. Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report, said the new E.P.A. proposal could be joined in the minds of voters with turmoil in the administration over the Department of Veterans Affairs and the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban custody.\u201cHow can voters not start to think that this election is a way to protest what he has done?\u201d Mr. Rothenberg said of the president. \u201cTo the extent it is about the president, it cannot help Democrats.\u201dAt the White House, the politics of the carbon rule is a no-brainer, officials said. In the months leading up to the announcement, Mr. Obama\u2019s top political advisers were united in agreement that the environmental proposal would be a winner for Democrats almost everywhere but in coal country.White House officials and other Democratic strategists say that climate change issues \u2014 and Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to push the pollution debate to center stage \u2014 will have even greater benefits for Democrats in presidential campaigns and future congressional elections.In interviews, they said the climate issue has become a way for voters to judge a candidate\u2019s character and broader outlook on the world. Officials compared the issue to the growing acceptance of same-sex marriage, especially among young people and suburban women.The president\u2019s political advisers said that candidates who opposed regulations on pollution or denied that climate change was real were likely to be seen by those voters as ideologically rigid and unwilling to accept scientists\u2019 conclusions. That will hurt Republican efforts to expand their support among young people and women, White House officials said.The effort to brand Republicans as anti-science or supporters of companies that produce the most pollution has become easier, officials said, because the party has moved away from acceptance of climate change and climate regulations. Some Republicans have sought recently to soften the way they talk about the issue, saying they believe in climate change but do not attribute it to human action.Still, as recently as five years ago, leading Republican politicians embraced so-called cap-and-trade regulations; now, the party\u2019s leadership vigorously opposes them. Mr. Garin, the pollster, said the hardening opposition among many Republicans to the science of climate change threatens to undermine their efforts to win back the White House in 2016. \u201cThe Republicans have created a negative branding around the perception that it is a backward-looking party,\u201d he said. \u201cThat perception gets deepened by their rejection of climate science.\u201dWhite House officials point to two examples as evidence of the problem for Republicans \u2014 and the potential opportunity for Democrats.In 2010, when the recession was near its worst and Republican fortunes were on the rise, voters in California easily defeated a proposal that would have suspended the state\u2019s aggressive air pollution laws until the economic struggles were over.And in 2013, Terry McAuliffe, then the Democratic nominee for governor in Virginia, ran television ads attacking his Republican opponent for denying the existence of climate change. Mr. McAuliffe won.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andrea Pirlo Is Italy\u2019s World Cup Maestro", "Date": "2014-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: World Cup PreviewAndrea Pirlo comes as close as it gets to being a quarterback on the soccer field.He lurks deep in Italy\u2019s midfield, just in front of the defense. In the blink of an eye, he can spin out a long, forward pass and land the ball on the broad chest of the striker Mario Balotelli. The Italians refer to Pirlo as l\u2019architetto or il professore \u2014 or simply Mozart.His compositions may now be more important than ever. In Brazil, particularly in the stifling heat and humidity of Manaus, where Italy will play England in their first World Cup match on Saturday, the maestro\u2019s strokes of economy may be priceless. When a player makes the ball move swifter than men can think, he spares their legs and their lungs from expending energy.In the heat and high humidity, the less a team has to run can be the difference between winning and losing. And not simply in one match, but in the following games, which arrive with barely enough time to recover from dehydration and weight loss and the psychological scars left by running out of juice.\u201cIn extra time, I was wrecked,\u201d the Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini said last year after the Azzurri and Spain had played to a standstill in Fortaleza, Brazil, in a Confederations Cup semifinal. \u201cThe heat was incredible, we were struggling to breathe.\u201dAfter 90 scoreless minutes of regulation time and 30 more in extra time, Spain won in a penalty shootout. Three days later, in Rio de Janeiro, the Spaniards lost the final to Brazil. But at least the Spaniards and the Italians, the previous two world champions, have experienced first hand some of the conditions that lie ahead at this World Cup. They have an idea what works and what doesn\u2019t in such extreme tropical conditions.What didn\u2019t work too well was having just three days after such a contest to travel south and meet a pumped up (and rested) Brazil in Rio. Spain was just too weary to cope with Neymar and company in the legendary Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. Even if Fortaleza does not have quite the jungle heat of Manaus, one lesson above all else was learned by Spain and Italy: It is the team that takes care of the ball and doesn\u2019t have to chase it so much that stands the greater chance of managing such matches. Spain\u2019s tiki-taka style, based on passing and keeping possession, makes opponents run. Pirlo\u2019s near perfect pitch \u2014 his ability to deliver the ball with such probing and precise passes \u2014 was masterful when Italy won the 2006 World Cup. And it was equally majestic when the Italians reached the Euro 2012 final in Warsaw, only to lose to Spain in that encounter.Barcelona\u2019s Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, who is also marvelously skilled at shielding and using the ball, might have edged Pirlo on that occasion simply because the Spaniard had more and better accomplices on his side.So if Italy has any chance of going far in this World Cup, Pirlo will have to be at the top of his game. Italy must try to use him sparingly. He is 35, with a long career behind him, loaded with 108 caps and a stash of trophies including a World Cup and Serie A and Champions League titles, won first with A.C. Milan and more recently with Juventus.Few observers are backing Italy to win this World Cup, but when the doubts are loudest is sometimes when Italy stirs. Gigi Buffon, the team\u2019s goalkeeper and captain, put it succinctly after the draw was made late last year, stacking Italy, England and Uruguay, three former world champions, in the same group. (Costa Rica is the fourth team drawn in that difficult Group D.)\u201cWe are competition animals,\u201d Buffon said at the time, referring to the Italian team. \u201cHowever we play between tournaments, we always come good in the tournaments themselves.\u201d (This was not the case in the 2010 World Cup, however, when Italy went home after the group stage without having won a game.)But Pirlo can be more expansive still with words. His autobiography, \u201cI Think Therefore I Play,\u201d was recently published in an English translation, as well as in Portuguese. Although the title is adapted from the French philosopher Descartes, the text is pure Pirlo.\u201cI\u2019m Italian,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut I\u2019m also a little Brazilian, Pirlonho if you like.\u201dHe describes how he taught himself to strike the ball by studying the free-kick technique of a mercurial Brazilian, Juninho Pernambucano.\u201cEach free kick,\u201d Pirlo states, \u201ccarries my name, and all are my children. And they have South American roots.\u201dHe writes of being mesmerized by Juninho when the Brazilian played for many years for Olympique Lyon in France, from 2001 to 2009. Pirlo collected DVDs of the Brazilian\u2019s play. He tried over and over again to induce the swerve that Juninho mysteriously imparted to the ball.Finally, suggests Pirlo, there came a eureka moment. He writes that he was in the bathroom when he suddenly realized that Juninho had an unusual way of making contact with the ball, using only the first three toes of his foot.The next day, still wearing his street shoes, Pirlo struck a ball at A.C. Milan\u2019s Milanello training site. Seven times he applied the Juninho technique, he recalled, and each time the ball curled into the top corner of the net.Juninho, barely four years Pirlo\u2019s senior, may not even have known the inspiration he provided. The Brazilian, who is among the greatest of free-kick specialists, just retired from playing in February. At 39 and back at the club in Brazil that had formed him, Vasco da Gama, Juninho came to the sad and emotional conclusion that his body was no longer capable of doing the training necessary to maintain all those fantastic free kicks and other parts of his game that appeared to the untutored eye to be \u201cnatural\u201d gifts.Pirlo, meanwhile, is still working on them, which is why he is at this World Cup, his fourth. One last shot at the world title is beckoning him. Pirlo\u2019s story is that of a metal trader\u2019s son whose sport brought him riches that enabled him to buy a vineyard and bottle his own wine.But, ever the soccer player, he has a harsh tongue, too. In his book, he excoriates the Italian striker Antonio Cassano. \u201cHe says he\u2019s slept with 700 women,\u201d Pirlo writes. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t get picked for Italy any more. Deep down, can he really be happy? I certainly wouldn\u2019t be.\u201dThe criticism is dated. Cassano is back in the fold, having been selected once more to play for Italy after two years away from the team. No doubt when the moment comes, Pirlo will pick him out in a scoring position and let bygones be bygones.Cassano, however, will have to earn the right even to step into the Azzurri lineup. Coach Cesare Prandelli has nurtured Balotelli with a devotion resembling that of a school master toward a gifted, wayward pupil. Balotelli can be big and boorish, and yet he showed during the Euro 2012 tournament that he, more than any other Italian player, can instinctively make himself available for Pirlo\u2019s raking passes.Prandelli preaches a high code of discipline, yet at the same time he indulges Balotelli and he recalls Cassano to the team. Why? Perhaps because he knows that Pirlo can plot the openings, but it still requires quick minds and deft feet up ahead of him to convert them.Pirlo\u2019s work, like that of a quarterback, does not become art without the talent on the receiving end. Where, for example, would the legendary Joe Montana have been without his San Francisco 49ers partner, the great wide receiver Jerry Rice? Soccer, like American football, is a team game elevated by individuals. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lithuania Moves Closer to Joining Euro Zone", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The looming deflation. The rising tide of anti-European populism. The near-record unemployment.The euro zone is a club that few potentially eligible countries are eager to join. But Lithuania on Wednesday moved closer to becoming its 19th member.The country received a passing grade from the European Central Bank and the European Commission on the requirements for membership. On Jan. 1, if all goes according to plan, shops in the country will start accepting euros and Lithuanians will cede sovereignty over monetary policy to the European Central Bank.Lithuania may be the last new member of the euro zone until the end of the decade, or even longer. Of the seven other European Union countries still planning to join someday, none meet all the criteria for economic performance, budget discipline or central bank independence, according to a status report issued on Wednesday by the European Central Bank.Reading the so-called convergence report, it is hard to escape the impression that countries like Sweden or the Czech Republic are not yet being invited to join because they are not really trying. So Lithuania\u2019s lone admittance among the current outsiders serves more as a reminder of the tarnished dream of a single currency than as a confirmation of the euro\u2019s continuing appeal.In theory, all members of the European Union are required to strive for euro membership, excluding Britain and Denmark, which opposed the idea when the euro was created by treaty in 1992 and received permanent exemptions. To qualify, countries must make changes to their legal systems and economies, such as loosening rules on hiring and firing.The European Union countries that remain outside the currency group are not showing much enthusiasm for doing that. In addition to Sweden and the Czech Republic, the other five are Bulgaria, Hungary, Croatia, Poland and Romania.\u201cThe countries that are left still have a lot to do structurally,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, director of Europe for the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm. \u201cIn order to progress, you need to invest some political capital. Some countries are delaying making those difficult choices.\u201dA case in point is Poland. With more than 38 million people and one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union, Poland would be a welcome addition to the euro club. But the government, facing strong opposition in Parliament, has not put a priority on bringing its central bank laws into harmony with euro zone standards.\u201cThey have mixed feelings about joining the euro,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cIt\u2019s more a political constraint than an economic one.\u201dIf Lithuania\u2019s membership is approved, as expected, by European governments after consultation with the European Parliament, the country will become the latest member since Latvia, its neighbor and fellow former Soviet republic, which joined at the beginning of this year. Estonia, another Baltic country, joined in 2011.The euro remains appealing to the smaller countries like Lithuania, a nation of three million people whose entire economic output equals less than half a year\u2019s revenue at Apple. Membership protects them from attacks by currency speculators, and a closer embrace with Europe offers additional help.The Lithuanian prime minister, Algirdas Butkevicius, suggested on Wednesday that linking his country to Brussels through the single currency would be beneficial in the wake of Russian assertiveness in Ukraine.Adopting the euro \u201cis one more step toward the deeper economic, financial and political national security,\u201d Mr. Butkevicius said in a statement issued by Lithuanian diplomats in Brussels.The move, he said, would mean a \u201cbetter life for all the residents of the country.\"The big sacrifice of euro zone membership is that countries can no longer allow their currencies to depreciate as a way of making their exports more competitive. That drawback is on painful display in Greece. Without their own currency to absorb the shock of the debt crisis, many Greeks have had to accept steep wage cuts, which in turn have undercut government tax receipts and corporate profit.In fact, the European Central Bank is now preoccupied with preventing other countries from slipping into the same deflationary cycle of falling prices and wages as Greece.Lithuania has tied its currency, the litas, to the euro for a decade. So it is will not really give up any room to maneuver. On the contrary, use of the euro relieves the country\u2019s central bank of the stress of having to defend the value of the litas on currency markets.And the European Union clearly retains appeal to countries outside its borders, as Ukrainians have amply demonstrated in recent months.But countries like Hungary and Sweden seem to prefer having it both ways \u2014 the easy trade and travel that membership in the bloc brings, without the straitjacket of the euro.After six years of crisis and near-record unemployment in the region, political leaders feel little popular pressure to join the euro zone. Parties that are hostile to the European Union or want to abandon the euro were the big winners in elections to the European Parliament last month. That was true even in France and Germany, the bloc\u2019s two largest members, as well as in Britain and Denmark.The remaining seven outliers are not yet even participating in the European exchange rate mechanism, a sort of junior membership under which national central banks pin the value of their currencies to the euro. Countries must be in the exchange rate mechanism for at least two years before they can join the euro, but there is no sign that any of the countries outside the euro will start participating even in that preliminary system soon.Some of the countries actually seem to be drifting further from European norms. Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, has been accused of infringing on the freedom of the press and meddling in central bank policy.The European Central Bank chided Budapest on Wednesday, urging the country to respect the independence of the Hungarian central bank. It also expressed concern about government measures to relieve Hungarian borrowers by restructuring loans at the expense of commercial banks.Sweden, which is supposed to be moving toward euro adoption, has been dragging its feet on laws necessary to harmonize its policies with euro zone standards, the European Central Bank said. \u201cAs yet no legislative action has been taken by the Swedish authorities to remedy the incompatibilities described in this and previous reports,\u201d the bank said, with a hint of peevishness.Even in Lithuania, a poll last year showed that opponents of euro membership outnumbered supporters by a wide margin, though sentiment may have shifted recently after the aggressive moves by Russia in Ukraine.European leaders on Wednesday cited Lithuania as proof that the euro remained alluring and as confirmation of the progress made to shore up the currency after six years of turmoil that nearly sank the project.\u201cThe euro area today has more effective economic policy coordination, a robust financial firewall to safeguard stability and, from this year, a banking union,\u201d Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said in a statement on Wednesday.Mr. Rehn issued a plea for those countries preferring to stand on the sidelines to remember the good parts of sharing the euro, noting that it made it easier for consumers to compare prices among countries and relieved people of the risk of fluctuating currencies.Membership, Mr. Rehn said, would \u201cbring a range of benefits to every country currently outside the euro area.\u201dThose outliers\u2019 eligibility will be assessed again in two years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Breaks for Apple and Starbucks Investigated by E.U.", "Date": "2014-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials have been pushing some countries to plug corporate tax loopholes for years to help bolster government coffers in an era of shrinking public budgets and weak economic growth.Now they are adopting a more forceful approach, announcing on Wednesday an investigation into how low-tax nations like Ireland have helped large multinationals like Apple and Starbucks reduce their tax bills by billions of dollars. The inquiry represents one of the most aggressive steps taken by Europe to counter the increasingly sophisticated tax avoidance strategies deployed by multinational companies, a move that follows similar crackdowns by the United States and others. Authorities are concerned that countries may be offering improper tax breaks to big global companies. The European investigation, by Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the European Union competition commissioner, highlights a critical weakness of region\u2019s great project of unification: the tendency for countries to march to their own beat by setting different tax policies. One result has been a hodgepodge of tax regimens, ranging from Ireland\u2019s cut-rate 12.5 percent at the low end to France\u2019s more punitive 34 percent. But tax policy is a politically perilous issue that risks heightening the already strong nationalist tendencies laid bare during European elections this month.\u201cEven ordinary citizens in Ireland and Luxembourg aren\u2019t going to like this because every time you have a certain degree of tax coordination they may end up losing revenues to other parts of the union,\u201d said Mario Mariniello, a European Union competition expert at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cBut there are other major benefits from being in a single market and so the commission should be acting to stop member states operating selective and discriminatory beggar-thy-neighbor tax policies.\u201dIreland\u2019s tax policy has been a source of continuing tension. The issue flared in 2010 when Ireland received $90 billion from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, a bailout the country exited late last year.High-tax countries like France were particularly vocal in demanding that Ireland raise its corporate tax rate as part of its package of reform commitments. Technocrats in Brussels and Washington also saw a rate increase as an easy way to raise desperately needed revenue. But Ireland pushed back hard, arguing that the low rate was crucial to the country\u2019s success, and the country\u2019s creditors eventually acquiesced.Now, the Irish economy is recovering, with a flood of new money pouring into the country. And with other European Union nations like Britain aggressively pushing their own corporate rates lower in a bid to attract multinational investments, European officials are becoming concerned about lost revenue streams.The inquiry will also examine Starbucks\u2019s tax treatment by the Netherlands and the tax arrangements in Luxembourg for Fiat Finance and Trade, a unit of the Italian automaker. Mr. Almunia said corporate tax practices in Britain and Belgium would come under the spotlight, though he mentioned no companies by name on Wednesday.Ireland said it would contest the premise of the investigation, while Apple said that it had \u201creceived no selective treatment from Irish officials\u201d and that it \u201cis subject to the same tax laws as scores of other international companies doing business in Ireland.\u201d Apple also noted that it was the second-largest employer in Cork, an Irish city, and that it had added 5,000 jobs in the European Union in the last three years. \u201cSuccess and growth come from the hard work of our Irish employees not from any special tax deal with the Irish government,\u201d it said.In a statement, Starbucks said it complied with all relevant tax rules, laws and guidelines, and was studying the announcement. The Dutch government said it would cooperate with the commission but had \u201cconfidence\u201d that no illegal aid would be found in \u201cone specific case\u201d concerning Starbucks. The tax practices questioned by the commission were \u201crobust and based on a thorough assessment\u201d as well as \u201cpositive for our business climate,\u201d it said. In Luxembourg, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry said the government would respond on Thursday. Fiat declined to comment.The effort by the authorities in Brussels is part of a global assault on loopholes that have allowed giant corporations to use complex tax structures to pay small amounts of taxes.Apple, despite being among the most profitable American companies, has avoided billions in taxes through a web of complex subsidiaries, according to lawmakers in the United States. In a report last year, the United States Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations identified Apple subsidiaries that have no \u201ctax residency\u201d in Ireland, where they are incorporated, or in the United States, where the executives who manage those units are based. The subcommittee said that Apple had \u201cexploited a difference between Irish and American tax residency rules\u201d but had not broken any laws.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, later defended the company\u2019s tax strategy in testimony before Congress, saying that profits made in the United States were taxed in the United States and that the company had a significant employee base in Ireland. In another widely cited example, Starbucks has paid low corporate taxes in Britain despite operating several hundred stores in that country. In April, Starbucks said that it would move its regional headquarters to London from Amsterdam. Mr. Almunia said that the investigations were vital after a bruising six-year economic crisis that has forced many countries to sharply reduce spending on public services.\u201cIn the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes,\u201d Mr. Almunia said at a news conference.\u201cThis is not the first time and will not be the last one,\u201d he added, referring to the prospect of further investigations. Asked about the possibility that Google, which bases much of its European operation in Ireland, could be swept up in the inquiry, Mr. Almunia said, \u201cI don\u2019t exclude anything.\u201dSuch cases can take years to resolve, and Mr. Almunia\u2019s term formally ends at the end of October. But he pledged that officials looking into such cases \u201cwill not stop working because their bosses will change.\u201dEuropean Union officials said their inquiry would examine \u201ctransfer pricing arrangements.\u201d Such activities commonly involve the shunting of profits and losses between subsidiaries by disguising them as internal corporate payments for goods or, as is increasingly common, for copyright or patent royalties.The investigation represents a particular threat to a business model finessed by Ireland, which has used its tax strategies and light-touch regulations to attract major multinational companies, providing prestige and jobs that would otherwise end up elsewhere in the union.\u201cWe will now turn to providing our detailed, technical legal rebuttal of the commission\u2019s position and if necessary will defend our position in the European courts,\u201d the Irish government said in a statement.The investigation involving Apple \u201ccould prove to be very damaging to the Irish economy and ultimately cost jobs,\u201d warned Michael McGrath, the spokesman on finance for the main Irish opposition party, Fianna F\u00e1il. \u201cOur competitors will hope that today\u2019s announcement is the start of the unraveling of our ability to secure multinational investment.\u201dMr. Almunia reserved his most negative assessment for Luxembourg, which he said had offered \u201conly partial\u201d cooperation in preliminary fact finding. \u201cThis job cannot be done with public information only,\u201d said Mr. Almunia, who at the news conference said that he had confronted Luxembourg\u2019s minister of finance, Pierre Gramegna, on the matter.No fines can be assessed in investigations of the sort that Mr. Almunia is conducting, which are mainly aimed at stopping unfair competition among states within the European Union. But if the commission finds that illegal aid was given, governments can be ordered to recover the money from the recipient companies.That has happened in at least one other set of tax cases concerning Spain. In 2011, the commission ordered the government to recover undisclosed sums from Spanish companies like Telef\u00f3nica and Iberdrola that were given tax advantages for acquiring foreign companies. The process of recovery is still underway, officials said.Member states also could be required to change their laws, \u201cbut this is still too soon to talk about,\u201d Mr. Almunia said. An earlier version of this article misidentified the newspaper that reported that the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, had said that Ireland\u2019s tax structure would be defended \u201cvery strongly\u201d in the event of an inquiry. It was The Irish Times, not The Irish Echo.Landon Thomas Jr. reported from New York and James Kanter from Brussels. Douglas Dalby contributed reporting from Dublin, and Stephen Castle from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Nudge to Save a Bit More", "Date": "2014-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyIf you\u2019re an active participant in social media, it\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid a running tally of everyone else\u2019s spending. New cars and home renovations are all over Facebook. Vacation photos, exotic meals and charity benefits are a fixture on Instagram.This year, Putnam Investments, which will soon become the second-biggest administrator of 401(k) plans, took a step toward giving customers some of this kind of comfort \u2014 or a kick in the pants. A central feature of its online retirement account statements is a new tool that allows users to see exactly how their savings rank against other Putnam account holders who are similar in age, income and gender. Then, using projections, it models how their numbers would change if they set more money aside from their paycheck \u2014 and allows them to make the change in a few clicks. Putnam refers to it as its \u201cJoneses Tool,\u201d as in \u201cKeeping up with.\u201dThe biggest goal that these companies share is to get people to set more money aside. Financial services firms win big when people do this, but so do those whose savings have fallen short so far. Putnam does not make its tool available to the general public, but it ran some numbers at my request to see where a variety of its customers stand.The results begin among its customers who are in the median for savings across a range of four sample ages and two potential incomes for each age. Among the various cases, the best result among the median savers was a group that is on track to reach just 72 percent of having a comfortable retirement income goal. The worst group seemed destined to reach only 25 percent. (Putnam defines comfort as having enough money saved to replace 75 percent of whatever your annual income is projected to be when you retire.) People who are in the 90th percentile of savers, however, appear set to hit somewhere between 86 and 103 percent of the goal.The company includes Social Security in this estimate, and the tool allows people to add money they have saved in retirement accounts elsewhere so that the retirement income estimate takes all of their assets into account. Nationally, Putnam believes that Americans are on track to replace just 61 percent of their income during retirement.To avoid a shrunken retirement budget, many people will need to save more money. For now, however, people are saving roughly the same percentage as they were a decade ago. The economy hasn\u2019t helped, but inertia may be at work too. Putnam had a hunch that by rubbing people\u2019s noses in the high savings of their peers, it could get the laggards to make some changes.The results so far have been impressive. In a sample of 10,000 users, 32 percent used the social comparison tool and adjusted the salary deferral level to see how the results may change. Of those who did play with the lever, there was a 28 percent average increase in the set-aside, to 9.6 percent of the paycheck, from 7.5 percent. To make it easy for people to say yes, the Putnam tool tells people what the pretax effect would be on their paycheck and allows them to make the switch in two clicks.A couple of other twists may be helping Putnam achieve that kind of lift. On its site, it avoids what it describes as the \u201caccounting view\u201d of information, where the balance would be the only thing a customer would see. A few hundred thousand dollars might seem like a decent amount of money, but it may not last more than a few years.Instead, it shows a customer\u2019s progress toward that ideal monthly retirement income goal and displays it front and center. \u201cWe use a monthly amount in order to put things in the context of how people actually live their financial lives today,\u201d said Steve Jenks, head of product and marketing for Putnam\u2019s defined-contribution plans. A shortage may scare people in a way that a lump-sum balance would not. The monthly income view may also keep people calmer during market declines, since the drop in the projected income figure won\u2019t look quite as bad as the raw drop in the overall balance.Putnam also breaks down estimates for people\u2019s health care costs in retirement, including Medicare premiums, co-pays and costs for supplemental insurance, though it doesn\u2019t address potential nursing home costs. Even without the long-term care costs, however, this can easily add up to hundreds of dollars each month. \u201cIf one-third of discretionary income is going to health care, that\u2019s a real aha! moment for some people,\u201d said Ed Murphy, who runs the defined contribution operation for Putnam. Even before the company introduced the social comparison tool, it saw customers saving more when confronted with the breakdown of those health care costs.Putnam\u2019s results aren\u2019t much of a surprise to Voya Financial. In a survey last year, it found that 52 percent of people said they would feel nudged into putting more money away for retirement if their savings didn\u2019t match up well with their peers. The fact that not that many Putnam customers made the move when confronted with the evidence suggests that people might need more of a shove than a nudge.Some employers take the less gentle approach already with a feature known as auto-escalation. Unless employees opt out, the percentage deferral from their paycheck automatically goes up, usually by a percentage point each year, until they reach the legal limit. Many employers choose not to offer the feature because more savings means more employer costs.All of this takes place out of public view, even if the social comparisons do rely on volunteers to share personal data. That means something is missing here \u2014 the ability to broadcast your own good behavior.While I don\u2019t think many people will be sharing their Putnam percentile rank on Facebook anytime soon, it\u2019s possible to share incremental savings progress in a way that doesn\u2019t seem smug. Financial services companies could provide a button to allow people to share the fact that they increased the money they\u2019re setting aside from their paychecks by at least a percentage point.Until they build this feature, let\u2019s have a go at it ourselves. If you\u2019ve started to save more or spend more carefully or improved some other part of your financial life recently, please tweet about it in the coming days with the hashtag #bettermoney so that we can all pat one another on the back in public.Twitter: @ronlieber Advertisement"}

(Since the university opened in 2007, all the valedictorians have been Iraqi women.) \u201cWe went through a whole different experience living in the dorms. This evening ... we are armed with two things: first, the highly valued American education that makes us as competent and qualified as the rest of the students in the world. And, second, the empowerment of a liberal arts education.\u201d As we \u201cexercise critical thinking techniques that have been the core of our education here, and as we try to move beyond the traditional conventions, beyond what others suggest, we may struggle. But isn\u2019t this how nations are built?\u201dSitting near Dara (I was the commencement speaker), I thought: This is how the Iraq story was supposed to end, but hasn\u2019t, not yet. Kurdistan remains the unsung success story of the Iraq war, one thing U.S. veterans can take pride in having helped to create \u2014 first by protecting the Kurds from Saddam Hussein with a no-fly zone and second by toppling Saddam, who had tried to wipe out the Kurds with poison gas in 1988.But it was the Kurds who used the window of freedom we opened for them to overcome internal divisions, start to reform their once Sopranos-like politics and create a vibrant economy that is now throwing up skyscrapers and colleges in major towns of Erbil and Sulaimani. Everywhere I\u2019ve gone here, I\u2019ve met \u201creverse immigrants,\u201d Kurds who\u2019ve come back to their homeland in northeastern Iraq because of all the opportunities.Kurdistan represents everything that has not happened in Shiite-dominated Baghdad and the Sunni regions of Iraq, where Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has behaved like a visionless, pro-Shiite sectarian chief and violence remains rife. Maliki was \u201cour guy.\u201d So you could say that we left two big \u201cgifts\u201d behind in Iraq: an American-installed autocrat and an American university that is teaching the values of inclusiveness that Maliki doesn\u2019t practice. In the long run, after Maliki is gone, we can still hope \u2014 as partially happened in Vietnam \u2014 that our values will triumph where our power failed. It\u2019s still a long shot, but that\u2019s clearly what the American University students are hoping.Bery Hoshiar, 20, a female engineering student, told me: \u201cPeople graduating here feel they can make a change. They come here as people bounded by social conventions, and they leave as individuals with values that they implement in their lives. We all believe that we can be future leaders. [Iraq] is not over. We are just getting started. We are building from scratch. It is going to take time.\u201dKarwan Gaznay, 24, a Kurd, told me he grew up on books about Saddam: \u201cNow we have this American education. I did not know who Thomas Jefferson was. I did not know who James Madison was. So when the government is doing something wrong, now we can say: \u2018This is wrong. I have been educated.\u2019 ... I ran for student president, and Arab guys voted for me. We are living as a family in the university. I am not pessimistic about Iraq. We can work together if we want to.\u201dAs student president, Gaznay persuaded the Kurdish government to create a special ID card for Sunni and Shiite AUIS students to use to easily pass through checkpoints that protect this region from the rest of Iraq. Isa Mohamed, 22, a Shiite from Baghdad, told me this was why he supported Gaznay: \u201cAny Arab [AUIS] student can now go through all the checkpoints and airports\u201d in Kurdistan without difficulties.Shayan Hamed, 23, said: \u201cYou hear democracy being used by your political leaders, but they are just defining it the way it suits them. But when you really learn what it is about in the real texts, then you realize that this is not the democracy in your country.\u201d I thought Iraq was finished, I said to her. \u201cGermany was not over after Hitler.

{"Headline": "International Monetary Fund Says Europe Should Weigh Bond-Buying", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUXEMBOURG \u2014 The International Monetary Fund on Thursday said that if inflation continued to drag, the euro zone\u2019s central bank could do more to invigorate the economy by buying government bonds and other financial assets. Such a program would in effect emulate the Federal Reserve\u2019s stimulus efforts. The I.M.F., in its annual report on the euro-currency union, also criticized its rules for managing national budgets as complicated and poorly enforced \u2014 even as some member nations continue to call for greater leeway. The stimulus recommendation from the I.M.F., which included a presentation Thursday evening by the fund\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, was made here at a meeting of finance ministers from the 18-country euro zone. It aligned the fund with a chorus of economists urging more aggressive action to stimulate the euro zone\u2019s barely growing economy and address its troublingly low levels of inflation. The fund, in other words, may be calling for the European Central Bank to engage in a stimulus program similar to the Federal Reserve\u2019s so-called quantitative easing in the United States \u2014 a big bond-buying program that the Fed is only slowly ending.Asked during a news conference what was meant by \u201cstubbornly low,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said it applied when measures taken to fight weak inflation were \u201cnot operative.\u201d Low meant \u201cobviously way below\u201d the 2 percent inflation rate target and \u201cit seems to us we are currently in that zone,\u201d\u00a0she said. A top official of the European Central Bank, speaking Thursday in Athens, expressed a willingness by the bank to follow Ms. Lagarde\u2019s advice, though perhaps not as quickly as she would like.The central bank is ready to begin large-scale asset purchases if it becomes clear that the euro zone economy faces \u201ca protracted period of low inflation and economic stagnation,\u201d V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, the vice president of the central bank, said, according to the text of a speech delivered at a conference in Athens.\u201cThe E.C.B. stands ready to deploy additional unconventional instruments, should the likelihood of this scenario increase,\u201d Mr. Const\u00e2ncio said. \u201cThe policy response would involve a broad-based asset-purchase program.\u201dMario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, has previously said that asset purchases were an option.Mr. Const\u00e2ncio\u2019s remarks Thursday were perhaps the most explicit declaration yet of the bank\u2019s willingness to emulate the Fed\u2019s program. He suggested that the central bank could find a way to introduce quantitative easing in the euro zone despite the lack of any pan-European government bond analogous to the United States Treasury securities purchased by the Fed.Some economists have questioned whether, because of the fragmented bond market, it would even be possible to conduct quantitative easing in Europe.\u201cThe experience of other countries with such programs testifies that they can be effectively designed,\u201d Mr. Const\u00e2ncio said.But Mr. Const\u00e2ncio added that he saw only a \u201clow probability\u201d that an extended period of stagnation and low inflation would occur. And he cautioned that asset purchases by the central bank would be effective only if governments also took steps to improve the performance of their economies.His remarks implied that, in return for stimulus action, the European Central Bank might demand that countries like France pursue economic changes the bank considers long overdue.Another issue at the ministers meeting in Luxembourg was whether the bloc\u2019s budget rules remain so rigid that they actually damage growth.Some governments and leaders are skeptical of the benefits of deficit limits and the push for austerity in recent years. Those leaders are seeking to reopen the issue with the backing of the Socialist group in the newly elected European Parliament.The push for changing European Union policies to do more to promote growth appeared to be gaining traction on Thursday amid suggestions by diplomats and European officials that left-leaning European leaders could meet on Saturday in Paris with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France to discuss the issue, according to a report by Reuters.Those leaders, who could include the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, would be likely to make broader support for anti-austerity policies a precondition of supporting Jean-Claude Juncker to lead the European Commission, when European Union leaders gather for a summit meeting at the end of next week.But that would invite a clash with Britain, which bitterly opposes the appointment of Mr. Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, on the grounds that he is too supportive of a federalist vision for Europe, and was foisted on leaders by the European Parliament.Arriving at the meeting, Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said his government was not demanding a change to the rules. Instead, he said, \u201cWe first need to find the right rhythm for each of our member states\u201d allowing for \u201can orderly decrease of the debt situation and a decrease in the deficit that take place in conditions compatible with, and even helpful to, growth.\u201dPier Carlo Padoan, the Italian minister for the economy and finance, also suggested that his government did not want wholesale changes. But there is \u201cneed to put in place all the instruments the E.U. already has to speed up growth and create jobs,\u201d he told reporters in Luxembourg.Suggestions on changing the system earned a frosty reception from Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister. \u201cThe current rules offer enough flexibility,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to change the rules \u2014 but to follow them,\u201d he told reporters.Ms. Lagarde, the I.M.F. head, told the news conference that the current rules need \u201csimplification to ensure there are no differences of interpretation and to put an end to therisk of complexity.\u201d But she acknowledged that was \u201cnot something that can be done overnight.\u201dIn its report, the fund called for a \u201csimpler framework\u201d based on the goal of reducing debt levels.Under European Union rules, governments in the 28-member bloc must keep their public deficit at no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product. But France is struggling to meet a 2015 deadline to bring its deficit below that level. And Italy, whose deficit came in right at the 3 percent ceiling last year, still faces the task of devising a strategy to prune its huge debt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seattle Leads the Way", "Date": "2014-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn recent decades, proposals to lift the minimum \u2014 whether on the federal, state or local level \u2014 have been presented as a way to restore purchasing power lost to inflation during long stretches with no raises. Seattle lawmakers have said, clearly and correctly, that catching up with inflation is not enough. To be adequate, a minimum wage also has to reflect real economic gains as measured by average wages and productivity growth. That could be accomplished by setting the federal minimum, currently $7.25 an hour, at $11 an hour to $18 an hour. But Republicans are opposed to even a paltry Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 by 2016. Congressional inaction has caused Seattle and other cities and states to act on their own. Ultimately, however, there is no substitute for a robust federal minimum wage, because broad prosperity requires a solid wage floor, not a patchwork. The question is whether bold action by states and municipalities will embolden Congress. In all, 27 states have minimums higher than that required by federal law, and five of them are phasing in hourly minimums of $10 or more: California ($10); Connecticut, Hawaii and Maryland ($10.10); and Vermont ($10.50). This year, eight states and the District of Columbia have increased their minimums. In several more states and municipalities, voters will decide on minimum wage increases in November. Before the Seattle vote, however, local minimums generally topped out around $11.50 an hour, raising the question of whether $15 an hour is feasible, in Seattle and elsewhere. Seattle lawmakers are phasing in the increase slowly \u2014 over seven years for employers with fewer than 500 workers, and over four years for larger employers that provide health insurance or three years for those that don\u2019t offer insurance. Other cities no doubt will find ways to tailor wage increases to their local economies. States, cities and the majority of Americans who support a higher minimum wage are showing Congress where it needs to go. It may not be all the way to a federal minimum of $15 an hour, but it is certainly more than the $10.10 an hour currently on the table. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nothing to Hide", "Date": "2014-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPaula Bomer writes the kind of women\u2019s fiction that critics like to call \u201craw.\u201d Her stark portrayals of biological womanhood have been described as raw and angry, raw and darkly funny, brutally raw and urgent. The word is meant literally, to a degree: Her earlier books, \u201cNine Months\u201d and \u201cBaby,\u201d feature birth scenes that spare no anatomical detail. But \u201craw\u201d has also come to mean something specific in blurb-speak about quasi-confessional writing by women, and it\u2019s not always fitting or fair. Half praise, half dis, it commends the struggle to embrace female ugliness while finding the work unsatisfactory. \u201cRaw\u201d work is visceral but also hard to digest \u2014 a kind term, in other words, for something half-baked.\u201cInside Madeleine,\u201d Bomer\u2019s latest collection of short stories, is the rare book for which the word seems truly warranted. Raw in form and content, the collection follows women for whom biology is destiny, and bodily control a desperate expression of free will: Bomer\u2019s characters starve themselves, stuff themselves, walk until their feet bleed, and smoke up until they cannot move. At every turn they struggle to square their strong personalities with the ritual and class-coded humiliations of being young and female. They are scolded by richer peers for wearing the wrong outfits, or by sexually dominant older men who tweak their budding nipples. Using sex and food as means of self-understanding, they fall into the traps the culture seems to set for them. Their stories don\u2019t end so much as stop \u2014 abruptly, on a sour note \u2014 and there are no resolutions. Women, Bomer suggests, don\u2019t get happy endings.The stories take place in 1986 in South Bend, Ind., where the writer is from, or in Boston and New York, where she has lived. The protagonists\u2019 four-\u00adsyllable names \u2014 Ruthie Waters, Lola Spencer, Maggie Drescher \u2014 all echo Paula Bomer\u2019s. The aggregate effect of this authorial overlap is tiring: \u201cIt was 1986, and it was the end of June,\u201d the narrator says in \u201cBreasts.\u201d \u201cIt was 1986,\u201d in Boston, in \u201cCleveland Circle House.\u201d \u201cIt was 1986, in South Bend,\u201d in \u201cDown the Alley.\u201d Ruthie Waters \u201cwas 14 years old, from South Bend,\u201d in \u201cOutsiders.\u201d Given her feathered hair and her friends\u2019 Lanz nightgowns, the year was also, probably, 1986. This narrowness can come across as sloppy, but it also suits Bomer\u2019s subject. What better construction of teen-girl consciousness than this punishing confinement to one\u2019s age, body and hometown? Intentionally or not, the repetition approximates the claustrophobic quality of adolescence Bomer seeks to capture. \u201cInside Madeleine,\u201d the novella-length title story, is the collection\u2019s best work. It follows an obese 12-year-old named Maddy, who grows out of one kind of voracity and into another when she discovers she has a larger-than-average vagina. She tests the limits of its capacity, experimenting with bunches of celery, economy-\u00adsize bottles of shampoo and eventually all the boys in town. She becomes a hungry, prodigious \u201chigh school whore,\u201d and in a twist on the typical ruined woman\u2019s decline in value, Maddy\u2019s sexual experiences accrue to a kind of mastery. When she gives this mastery up for another, landing in the dead-end of female ambition \u2014 anorexia \u2014 Bomer leaves us with a kind of chiasmus: hoarding food, hoarding sex; shunning sex, shunning food. They\u2019re mirror images of the same thing. Bomer offers her characters no outs \u2014 only the creeping sense that they\u2019re doomed to swing forever between futile attempts at self-determination. Some readers may chalk this failure up to a problem of craft, since sticking landings isn\u2019t Bomer\u2019s strong suit. But after so many pages, it\u2019s evident that the limitation isn\u2019t hers alone. It\u2019s hard to write realistic visions of happiness for women when the world seems to offer so few.

{"Headline": "Massachusetts Democrat Wins Over Voters; Her Party Is a Different Story", "Date": "2014-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 It was a cringe-worthy moment for Massachusetts Democrats.Martha Coakley, who was running in 2010 for the Senate seat long held by Edward M. Kennedy, spoke dismissively of the campaign ritual of shaking hands with voters at their beloved Fenway Park. That moment came to epitomize all that critics said was wrong with her candidacy, and she went on to lose the race, turning over \u201cTeddy\u2019s seat\u201d to Scott P. Brown, a Republican.On Saturday, she will face her first big political test since 2010, when 6,000 Democratic activists meet at the state party convention in Worcester to endorse a candidate for governor.Ms. Coakley, 60, the state\u2019s attorney general since 2007, holds a substantial lead in polls of voters, running way ahead of her four rivals.But in an unusual dynamic, she appears not to have won over party insiders. Indications are that despite her popularity with voters, Ms. Coakley will not win her party\u2019s endorsement. The endorsement will almost certainly go to Steve Grossman, 68, the state treasurer, who lags far behind her in the public opinion polls.Analysts explain the situation this way: Ms. Coakley leads among voters in part because she has the highest name recognition. And she lags among party activists because of their lingering concern from 2010 that she will not be able to fire up the troops sufficiently to keep the governor\u2019s office in Democratic hands. (Gov. Deval Patrick is not seeking a third term.)Mr. Grossman leads among convention delegates because he is a longtime party insider; he is a former chairman of the state and national Democratic Parties, a fund-raising stalwart who is calling in his chits. He has not caught on with voters because he has an insider image and voters do not know him.Ms. Coakley minimizes the importance of the convention, calling it just one step in the process toward November. She\u00a0has been tamping down expectations about her potential delegate haul, saying she wants only to emerge with at least 15 percent, the minimum to earn a spot on the Sept. 9 primary ballot.Her focus, she says, is meeting people and reassuring them, when asked, that she has learned from the mistakes in 2010, including that she was too aloof.\u201cThe lessons learned are that people want to see you\u2019re committed and they want to see you and they want to be able to talk to you and pinch you and ask you questions,\u201d she said during an interview in a restaurant in Salem last weekend after a campaign meet-and-greet event.She said she was receiving a noticeably friendlier reception this time. Voters, she said, are telling her that \u201cyou got back up on your feet, you worked hard for us, you\u2019ve earned this, and we\u2019re going to help you this time.\u201d\u201cI just feel it\u2019s important for people to know who I am, where I come from, what my experience has been and also to relate that to what it means to be a good governor,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through this. I know how tough it is.\u201dVoters at the Salem event said they liked her, but a few expressed reservations about her campaign. Tom Buonaugurio, a retired teacher, said he supported her but wanted her to show a little more verve in the manner of Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who defeated Mr. Brown in 2012. \u201cI know people think women should have some decorum, but Martha needs to be more like Warren, who didn\u2019t let Brown get away with anything,\u201d he said.Leslie Schwartz, also a retired teacher, agreed, saying she liked Ms. Coakley\u2019s views, \u201cbut she needs to pick up the ball and run with it.\u201dMs. Schwartz\u2019s husband, Alan, an engineer, who is undecided, said he wanted Ms. Coakley to raise her energy level, but he appreciated that her campaign had called him to come to the event. \u201cThey seem more serious this time,\u201d he said.Dale Orlando, a retired psychologist, is also undecided. \u201cMartha has done a fantastic job as attorney general, and it\u2019s time for the state to have a woman governor,\u201d she said.But she said she did not like Ms. Coakley\u2019s recent agreement to allow Partners HealthCare, the state\u2019s largest hospital and physician network, to acquire three more hospitals. The deal has been criticized for potentially raising health care costs and putting some hospitals out of business.The five Democratic candidates have differed little on major policy questions facing the state, which is enjoying a relatively healthy postrecession economy. This has muted interest in the race, and the candidates have had a hard time distinguishing themselves. Behind them were Donald Berwick, a former federal Medicaid and Medicare administrator; Juliette Kayyem, a national security specialist; and Joseph Avellone, a biotech executive.The poll also showed Ms. Coakley leading Charlie Baker, the likely Republican nominee, in November; she was the only Democrat ahead of him.Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist, said that voters were likely to be puzzled that Ms. Coakley was supposedly the front-runner and yet could not win her party\u2019s endorsement. The crucial factor, Ms. Marsh said, will be how Ms. Coakley is able to frame her convention performance afterward and \u201cwhether she reassures voters or whether she reinforces their concerns about her.\u201dScott Ferson, another Democratic strategist, said Ms. Coakley might be able to turn a weak delegate haul at the convention into a plus among regular voters. \u201cThey don\u2019t expect her to be the consummate political insider who should have all this wrapped up,\u201d he said.In any case, the candidates are expected to turn to Twitter early and often during the convention to start putting their own spin on the narrative that will drive the race to the September primary.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Carney Details New Weapons to Cool British Housing Market", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, announced measures on Thursday to try to cool England\u2019s blistering housing market, a sector that he and other policy makers have identified as the greatest potential threat to Britain\u2019s economic recovery.Mr. Carney said that while the housing boom did not currently imperil the country\u2019s economic and financial stability, the new policies would act as insurance against potential future overheating.\u201cWe have seen time and again how quickly \u2018responsible\u2019 can turn to \u2018reckless,\u2019 creating risks that ultimately derail the U.K. economy,\u201d he said.The bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, formed to help curb persistent boom-and-bust cycles, moved to restrict the number of new residential mortgages that were equivalent to, or more than, 4.5 times a borrower\u2019s annual income. The panel said that banks could have no more than 15 percent of such loans in their portfolios.The committee also said that mortgage lenders, when assessing affordability, should apply a stress test to determine if borrowers could still pay the loan if interest rates rose three percentage points higher in the first five years of the loan.Mr. Carney said the new lending rules \u201cshould not restrain current housing market activity\u201d but would kick in if house prices continued to rise drastically or incomes failed to grow.The bank is trying to balance maintaining the country\u2019s strong economic recovery against reining in a housing market that blossomed during a period of loose monetary policy. For five years, that policy has flooded the financial system with cheap loans.Some analysts saw the measures as more tentative than the market was anticipating. \u201cIn reality, the latest measures introduced by the Bank of England are practices that are already being followed by many lenders,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief United Kingdom and European economist at IHS Global Insight.He noted that both the Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland had already announced that they would limit mortgages to a maximum of four times a borrower\u2019s annual earnings when lending more than 500,000 pounds, or about $849,000, on a property.Like the United States, Britain has an inglorious history of housing booms and busts. Propelled by record low interest rates \u2014 now at 0.5 percent, which is the lowest since the Bank of England was founded in 1694 \u2014 Britain\u2019s housing market has taken off. Home prices jumped about 10 percent in the last year through April.The committee\u2019s report underscored that the recovery in the housing market has been associated with a \u201cmarked rise in the share of mortgages extended at high loan-to-income ratios.\u201dAt present, banks are not exceeding the new loan-to-income cap. Only 10 percent of mortgages issued in the 12 months through March exceeded the ratio of 4.5 times a borrower\u2019s annual income. That ratio is far more stark in London, where about 22 percent of mortgages are above the cap, meaning the impact could be more widely felt in the city, said Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank.The moves take the Bank of England into uncharted territory as it seeks to use relatively new and untested supervisory powers to curb market distortions.The Financial Policy Committee has so-called macroprudential powers to remove or reduce systemic risks in the financial system, including imposing lending rules and conducting stress tests, currently underway, to see how financial institutions would weather a major correction.Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, said the committee\u2019s decision was significant. Two years ago, he noted, the central bank seemed reluctant to use tools that targeted loan-to-income ratios, questioning whether there had been sufficient debate about their effectiveness.\u201cThe bank has now signaled that it may act vigorously to head off the economic and financial stability risks that may arise from an overheating housing market,\u201d he said.According to the committee\u2019s Financial Stability Report, British banks are now more solidly capitalized. Capital raising and a reduction in noncore assets have contributed to the bigger cushions.Additional measures required by British regulators to ensure that banks have sufficient capital buffers will now be removed, and banks will be required to comply only with international standards, called Basel III.The British Bankers\u2019 Association had cautioned against the committee\u2019s introducing draconian measures, and it called Thursday\u2019s announcement a \u201ccautious and clever intervention\u201d that will have little effect on the market in the short-term, \u201cbut sets an important backstop to ensure indebtedness does not get out of control.\u201dThe association has recently pointed to signs that the housing market is slowing, noting that mortgage approvals have fallen for four successive months, in part in response to policy measures taken this year.Questions now remain about how the central bank\u2019s efforts will play out when interest rates rise from current lows.Analysts say that Mr. Carney\u2019s approach to guiding the markets toward when rates would rise has been unclear. At a speech delivered to bankers this month, he said that interest rates could rise \u201csooner than markets presently expect.\u201dBut then on Tuesday at a hearing by the Parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee, he struck a seemingly different note. He said that the most recent data showed average real wages had contracted again in April, indicating that the economy had more slack between what it could produce and what it was producing.The measures introduced may buy the bank more time before it is forced to raise rates. Yet it will be hard pressed to address a crucial component bolstering the exuberant housing market: lack of supply.\u201cIn the end, the only things that will really cool the market are putting up rates and building thousands more homes \u2014 now,\u201d Eversheds, a British law firm, said.An earlier version of this article misstated a mortgage loan-to-income figure introduced by the Bank of England. The bank moved to\u00a0restrict the number of new residential mortgages that were equivalent to, or more than, 4.5 times a borrower\u2019s annual income, not 4.5 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rail Strike Strands French and Tests Their President", "Date": "2014-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Now entering its second week, the national railway strike here has stranded thousands and exasperated millions more. It has brought on even more stress for high school students trying to reach their nationwide graduation test sites; upended business trips, hospital visits, vacations and daily commutes; and cost the state rail system upward of $250 million (about 184.2 million euros).It is also becoming a moment of truth for the beleaguered government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.Faced with a stagnant economy; a vast, underfunded system of social-welfare benefits; and deep unpopularity, Mr. Hollande is trying to persuade his Socialist Party to embrace a more centrist path that includes tax and spending cuts and more market competition. The main opposition is coming from his base on the left, especially labor unions.The rail strike is seen as a crucial test of Mr. Hollande\u2019s willingness to hang tough in the face of criticism from that opposition and the ensuing strains in his party. Two major unions are striking in an effort to block a planned restructuring of the national rail system, a change intended to help prepare for further competition with private and foreign train services, in accordance with European Union directives.Given the disruption caused by the strike, there is not a great deal of public support for it, especially in light of the generous welfare benefits and labor safeguards that rail workers receive. But French law affords broad legal protections to striking workers, and the government has been unable to persuade the unions to back down.On Wednesday, train service was still cut by about half nationwide, with 12 percent of workers on strike, according to the S.N.C.F., the national rail operator. That was down from a high of nearly 28 percent last week, but the two unions leading the strike, the CGT and SUD-Rail, said it would continue Thursday. On Wednesday afternoon at the Gare de Lyon station in Paris, Thierry Clergue, 49, awaited a train home to Montpellier after an earlier train was canceled.\u201cIt\u2019s France, and it\u2019s madness \u2014 everyone\u2019s resigned to it,\u201d Mr. Clergue said. French unions \u201cdon\u2019t want to shift,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the world is shifting.\u201dThe proposed overhaul, which is being debated in the lower house of Parliament this week, would combine the S.N.C.F. with the R.F.F., the state administration that oversees the rail network infrastructure, under a newly formed state rail parent company, to be called the S.N.C.F.The unions say the overhaul is little more than cosmetic and is likely to increase administrative waste, not reduce it, as the government contends. In an unusual convergence of opinion, some lawmakers on the right as well as defectors from Mr. Hollande\u2019s leftist parliamentary majority agree. Though politicians from across the political spectrum have expressed reservations about the restructuring plan, only members of the radical left have backed the strike.But union leaders have also asserted that the government is secretly planning to privatize the rail system, and they fear a potential disruption to the benefits that railway workers are currently guaranteed by law, including full retirement pensions for drivers as young as 50 and conductors and other workers as young as 55. The government has called those worries unfounded. Despite unrest among Socialist Party lawmakers, Prime Minister Manuel Valls, the most prominent of the party\u2019s centrists, has pledged to push the legislation through Parliament. The work stoppage \u201cmakes no sense with the current conditions of dialogue that exist, and with respect to a bill that would reform, modernize the S.N.C.F., and which protects the statutes of rail workers,\u201d Mr. Valls said.If there is any agreement between the strikers and everyone else, it is that the system could benefit from some adjustments. Defenders of the status quo \u2014 in which the S.N.C.F. handles the trains while the R.F.F. handles the rails \u2014 are few. S.N.C.F. administrators recently discovered that, after receiving faulty measurements from R.F.F., the company spent \u20ac3 billion on new trains that were too wide for about 15 percent of France\u2019s rail stations.Ma\u00efa de la Baume contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Hundreds of opposition members have been sentenced to death in absentia. The Muslim Brotherhood, the main opposition party, has been outlawed. So has the April 6 Youth Movement, the secular coalition that helped lead the 2011 protests against Mr. Mubarak.The real question now is how much longer the United States government will be able to continue to justify giving over $1 billion a year to Egypt\u2019s regime.Peter Hayakawa, Washington\u00a0Regime change and North KoreaRe \u201cLet North Korea collapse\u201d (Opinion, June 17): Analysts have argued for decades that North Korea is on the verge of imminent collapse. But according to some experts, the economic situation inside the country is better now than at any point in recent history. Chinese and Russian investments have hastened infrastructure and construction projects, and Pyongyang is putting greater priority on special economic zones.Rather than elbowing Pyongyang into a confrontational stance and creating conditions for regime change, the sensible thing to do is to promote legitimate economic activity with regional partners. This gives greater incentives for Pyongyang to be accountable, and increases the quality of life for the people. Any attempts at regime change would yield unforeseen consequences that could make the status quo of the past 60 years look more preferable by comparison.There is no easy answer to the Korean question, but the current path has only deepened the suffering of the North Korean people. The outside world should keep in place sanctions only on military technology, while encouraging Pyongyang\u2019s efforts to develop its economy.The region and its people would be far better off encouraging a \u201cdevelopmental dictatorship\u201d in Pyongyang, rather than pursuing antagonistic regime change policies that embolden a siege mentality and encourage inter-Korean brinksmanship.Nile Bowie Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaAdvertisement"}

Six and a half years after the Great Recession began, and five years after it ended, we have now regained all the jobs lost during the downturn. Huzzah!O.K., maybe not.At the previous high, in January 2008, American employers had 138.365 million jobs. With a solid 217,000 positions added in May 2014, that number has now reached a new high of 138.463 million. Yet we can all agree that, if throwing a ticker-tape parade for the economy was a thing that happened, we wouldn\u2019t be doing it. The reasons tell something important about the economic calamity the nation has been through and why public opinion polls show such continued discontent among ordinary Americans.The May jobs numbers released Friday morning were quite solid, and fit with both analysts\u2019 forecasts and the general tenor of recent data \u2014 not just the 217,000 payroll jobs added, but an unemployment rate unchanged at 6.3 percent and hourly wage gains of 0.2 percent for private-sector employees.But a bit of simple math shows why, even after a progression of solid months of jobs data like May, things don\u2019t feel so great.Yes, the number of jobs on United States employers\u2019 payrolls has risen back to its pre-recession levels. But in the six and a half years that have passed, the nation\u2019s population has risen a good deal; the civilian noninstitutional population has risen since January 2008, to 247.4 million from 232.6 million. So we now have about the same number of jobs as we did then, but about 15 million more people who might wish to hold them.And consider wages. The average private-sector worker took home $838.70 a week in April. In January 2008, if you use April 2014 dollars, that was $818.31. In other words, in the last six and a half years, the average private-sector American worker has seen a total inflation-adjusted pay increase of only 2.5 percent, a lousy $20 a week.The question is not whether the economy is in as good a shape today as it was back in January 2008, when total American payrolls were last at this level; it quite clearly isn\u2019t. Rather, this milestone of surpassing the previous employment high is a good occasion to ask how much further we have to go to get to that position of true health.The problem, of course, is that there is no single definition of good health. Economists think the nation is at full employment when the unemployment rate is something like 5.5 percent (it can\u2019t fall too much lower because some people are always between jobs, and if it falls too low inflation will result).That would imply 1.24 million of the people who are currently unemployed finding themselves with a job. But that number is too simplistic \u2014 it implies a static system with the labor force consisting only of the people who were in it in May.In reality, the labor force remains a good bit smaller than you would expect it to be given demographic trends. Presumably, if unemployment keeps falling, employers keep hiring, and worker pay starts to rise, at some point some of those people will decide they want a job after all. But it is hard to know just how big this shadow work force is. How many of the 61-year-olds who gave up looking for a job in the last few years are going to return to the labor force when they smell opportunity, and how many have retired for good?We\u2019ll only know that for sure as the recovery continues and indicators like the labor force participation rate (the proportion of the population who either have a job or are looking for one) rise significantly. For what it\u2019s worth, it was unchanged in May at 62.8 percent.Advertisement"}

The moral giant has become a calculating politician.Buddhists are renowned for peacefulness, yet, here in Myanmar, Buddhist monks have marched through the streets, demanding the expulsion of humanitarian workers who would try to save the lives of Muslims.Obama and Aung San Suu Kyi will probably flinch as they read this, protesting that Myanmar is infinitely complicated. True. Muslims have also killed Buddhists in clashes, and no country should be judged solely based on its worst side.I wish Obama and Aung San Suu Kyi could have sat down with Noor Begum, an emaciated 37-year-old woman who is confined to an internment camp without doctors and over the course of three days lost her husband and her twin babies. She doesn\u2019t really know what killed them; all she knows is that first one baby died, then her husband and, finally, the other twin.Then there\u2019s Asiya Khatu, 28, who smashed her finger in a door, breaking the bone so that it protruded from the finger. She needed a doctor but had to settle for the only alternative: a makeshift pharmacy run by a man named Maung Maung Tin.I wish my local CVS pharmacy could do what he managed. He cut open the finger, pushed the bone back in place and then stitched her up with a splint of bamboo.That\u2019s a sign of the resilience that is as stunning a feature of the camps as the deprivation. There is suffering, death and despair, but there is also courage, generosity and ambition.With no jobs available, Anwa Begum, a 17-year-old girl, dives in the sea for driftwood to sell as firewood. In a day she can collect wood worth about 20 cents.Or there\u2019s Khin Thuzar Myint, a brilliant 15-year-old girl. Because there are no formal schools for the Rohingya, she attends an informal school \u2014 where she is first in her class. She studies until midnight every evening and yearns to go to medical school and care for her people.It\u2019s probably an impossible dream. There are only a couple of Rohingya doctors in the region, and one of them is in prison.The role of Aung San Suu Kyi is particularly sad. She has lost international stature because of her unwillingness to speak truth to her people, while at home many voters object that she is insufficiently chauvinist.\u201cShe supports Muslims,\u201d U Pan Tha, a 66-year-old Buddhist, told me, bitterly. His home was burned by Muslims in 2012 clashes, and he now lives in a camp for displaced people. He voted for Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party in 1990, but he says he won\u2019t in the elections next year. \u201cWe will choose the military government over Suu Kyi,\u201d he said.Myanmar is advancing in many directions, and it\u2019s exciting to see the political and economic transformation. But there\u2019s also a poison spreading, and Western governments do no one any good by pretending not to notice.One evening I visited a camp of Buddhists displaced by the conflict and asked a group of children what they would do if they saw a Muslim boy.\u201cKill him,\u201d said Maung Thein Soe, 13.A couple of days later in the Rohingya encampment, I encountered a group of Muslim children.

{"Headline": "Wave of Minors on Their Own Rush to Cross Southwest Border", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHonduran migrants traveling with children from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, to Guatemala City, fleeing the violence in the country.SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras \u2014 After a decade apart, 13-year-old Robin Tulio was finally heading to the border to be with his mother. A maid, living illegally in Baltimore, she had decided the time was right to smuggle her son into the United States.Like so many others across Central America, Robin said his mother believed that the Obama administration had quietly changed its policy regarding unaccompanied minors and that if he made it across, he would have a better shot at staying.She hired a smuggler, but Robin didn\u2019t make it.\u201cIt\u2019s too hard,\u201d he said after being caught in Mexico recently and sent home to Honduras. But his aborted journey helps explain why there has been a rush of migration of unaccompanied minors so severe that the United Nations declared it a humanitarian crisis akin to refugees\u2019 fleeing war.Many say they are going because they believe that the United States treats migrant children traveling alone and women with their children more leniently than adult illegal immigrants with no children.The Obama administration says the primary cause of the influx of children is rising crime and ailing economies in Central America, not policy changes in the United States.To deal with the surge, the administration on Monday used a California naval base to house recently apprehended minors and ordered the federal emergency administrator to develop a plan of action.\u201cWe have heard sort of rumors and reports, or suggestions, that the increase may be in response to the perception that children would be allowed to stay or that immigration reform would in some way benefit these children,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, in a conference call with reporters on Monday. \u201cIt seems to be quite clear that what is driving this is what\u2019s happening in their home countries.\u201dOfficials said that recently arrived children would not benefit from the immigration bill passed by the Senate last year or from Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that lets minors who meet certain criteria avoid deportation.But even as the government moves to confront the situation, children, parents, immigration officials, lawyers and activists interviewed say that there has been a subtle shift in the way the United States treats minors.That perception has inspired parents who have not seen their children for years to hire so-called coyotes, guides often associated with organized crime, to bring them north. It has prompted other parents to make the trip with toddlers in tow, something rarely seen before in the region.\u201cIf you make it, they take you to a shelter and take care of you and let you have permission to stay,\u201d Robin said after he stepped off a bus on a Thursday night with eight others caught on their way north. \u201cWhen you appeal your case, if you say you want to study, they support you.\u201dIn San Pedro Sula, in northern Honduras, a group of women and their children were huddled in a bus terminal earlier in the week, ready to begin a multiweek journey to Mexico and beyond. \u201cThe passage is easier with the kids, and this way we\u2019re not dumping them with relatives,\u201d said Arelys S\u00e1nchez, who was traveling with two young daughters. \u201cI think with them, it\u2019s easier for them to let you stay.\u201dWhile the Obama administration has moved aggressively to deport adults, it has in fact expelled far fewer children than in the past. Largely because of a 2008 federal law aimed at protecting trafficked children, the administration in 2013 deported one-fifth the number of Central American children as were expelled in 2008, according to federal government statistics.Ana Solorzano, an immigration official who tends to deportees in El Salvador, said that as the number of deportees flown by air to El Salvador from the United States started to drop, the number of people returned by land from Mexico started to rise. Of the 325 Salvadoran children who were deported last year, only 22 came from the United States, she said.\u201cThey have not publicly recognized a change in public policy, but we see it,\u201d Ms. Solorzano said.Central Americans, she said, were left with the sense that the United States had \u201copened its doors\u201d to women and children.As more of those children were released from federal shelters and the number placed with parents or in foster care soared, other parents noticed. Those parents were encouraged by the opportunities children were being given to fight their cases in court \u2014 even if they were ultimately unlikely to succeed.\u201cIt\u2019s a massive Catch-22,\u201d said Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, an organization that matches unaccompanied minors with volunteer lawyers. \u201cThe problem here is that the system is broken. It\u2019s going to implode.\u201dOne federal judge slammed the Department of Homeland Security for \u201ccompleting a criminal conspiracy\u201d by placing a recently smuggled child with the undocumented immigrant parent who had hired the smugglers.Experts say it is the dual dynamics of crime at home and perceived leniency across the border that have inspired many in Central America to risk the trip. The United Nations has consistently listed Honduras, for example, as the country with the highest murder rate in the world. Its latest report said Honduras had 90.4 killings per 100,000 residents, nearly three times the rate a decade ago. In El Salvador, that number is 41.Elizabeth Kennedy, a Fulbright scholar who is studying Salvadoran youth migration, said 60 percent of the 326 students she had interviewed cited gangs and crime as the reason they were leaving.\u201cA large number are forcibly recruited by gangs,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said. \u201cMost kids lived in areas that are controlled by one or both of the gangs.\u201dIn Honduras, the authorities are receiving more buses filled with a larger number of juvenile deportees, and they are increasingly younger and often girls. As gang violence here worsens and word gets out that the children who made it to the other side were reunited with long-lost parents with the blessing of United States immigration authorities, more and more youngsters are making the treacherous journey.Maynor Dub\u00f3n, 17, tried to cross the border last year. But he, too, was caught and wound up at Casa Alianza, a children\u2019s shelter in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, for a year. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know what moment you\u2019re going to be killed,\u201d he said of life in Honduras. \u201cThe gangs say things like, \u2018You work for me now.\u2019 They asked me to join, and I said, \u2018Let me think about it for a few days,\u2019 so I left. It\u2019s like being in hell.\u201dA member of his immediate family was murdered at the family\u2019s front door this year, so he is using the barber skills he learned at Casa Alianza to save money to try again. He must leave, he said, before he turns 18 in September.Government officials say they are at a loss, because they cannot prohibit the children\u2019s departure, but they worry what such an exodus will mean for the nation\u2019s future.\u201cThe governments have to do something; we can\u2019t continue like this. These children are our future,\u201d said Felipe Morales, executive director of the Honduran federal children\u2019s services agency. \u201cThis is a tragedy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By far South Korea\u2019s smelliest food, the fish, called hongeo, is described by lovers and detractors alike as releasing odors reminiscent of an outhouse. Served most often as chewy pink slabs of sashimi, hongeo is prized by enthusiasts for the ammonia fumes it releases, sometimes so strong they cause people\u2019s mouths to peel.\u201cI used to think that people could not possibly eat this stuff unless they were crazy,\u201d said Park Jae-hee, a 48-year-old marketing executive. \u201cBut like smelly blue cheese, it has no replacement once you fall in love with it.\u201dIt is easy, of course, to poke fun at other nations\u2019 cuisines: Consider Europeans\u2019 wrinkled noses at the American penchant for slathering ketchup on everything from fries to scrambled eggs. But some South Koreans who are otherwise fiercely proud of their fiery, often odoriferous foods, like kimchi, admit to being repelled by hongeo and baffled by its rising popularity.\u201cI can\u2019t understand who in the world would pay to eat a rotten fish in a restaurant that smells like an uncleaned public restroom,\u201d said Ms. Park\u2019s closest friend, Huh Eun.Even those who swoon over its exotic taste cheerily admit their passion comes with some social costs. A subway ride after a meal of hongeo can be isolating, with fellow riders sometimes casting furtive glances and sidling away. Owners of restaurants that specialize in hongeo advise customers to seal their jackets in plastic bags before the meal and offer to spray them with deodorant afterward.The lowly fish, once just a regional specialty in the southwest provinces of North and South Jeolla, followed the migration of rural workers during South Korea\u2019s industrial boom in the 20th century, with restaurants specializing in hongeo opening to serve growing populations of scattered Jeolla natives.Still, it took a while to catch on, thwarted not only by its formidable odor and limited supply, but also by the regional prejudices that have dogged Jeolla, where Heuksan Island is. During decades of military dictatorships, the country\u2019s elites, often from rival Gyeongsang Province, were accused of ostracizing Jeolla and fomenting a bias that outlived authoritarian rule.Then, about 10 years ago, a free-trade agreement with Chile helped wear down resistance to Jeolla\u2019s signature fish dish, flooding the market with relatively cheap Chilean hongeo and inspiring new restaurants to open.Among the legions of the fish\u2019s fans, the velvety texture of frozen hongeo liver melting on the tongue with a pinch of salt and red pepper has been compared to foie gras. The smell, to their minds, is most of the appeal, coupled with a tingling in the mouth that accompanies the hit of ammonia. Gourmets say a proper hongeo dinner must end with hongeo soup, steaming with the smell of boiling ammonia.Despite the dish\u2019s newfound popularity, the center of hongeo worship remains here on Heuksan Island, off the country\u2019s southwestern tip. The bottom-feeding fish with the Guy Fawkes-like smile has long been the foundation of the island\u2019s economy, and fishing boats head out several times a month to nearby waters where hongeo feed and lay eggs.Islanders say the fish first gained a following here because of a quirk of biology. In the days before refrigeration, the fishermen\u2019s forebears learned that hongeo was the only fish they could ship to the mainland 60 miles away without salting. The hongeo lacks a bladder and excretes uric acid through its skin. As it ferments, it oozes ammonia that keeps it from going bad.\u201cHongeo can\u2019t pee, and that\u2019s where the miracle begins,\u201d said Kim Young-chang, 77, the owner of a hongeo restaurant here. A true believer in the fish\u2019s power, Mr. Kim rattled off a list of health benefits he believes come from eating it. \u201cI have never seen anyone having stomach trouble after eating hongeo,\u201d he proclaimed.Among Heuksan residents and their neighbors across the water in mainland Jeolla, hongeo has long been an integral part of local tradition and lore. Wedding parties are considered incomplete if hongeo is not served. And natives point out that the dissident-turned-president Kim Dae-jung, perhaps Jeolla\u2019s most famous son, was so homesick for the fish that politicians made sure to bring him fresh stocks during the years of military rule when he was in exile.The fish has also helped rejuvenate this island of 2,200, once a major port, where thousands of boats sought shelter from typhoons and where crews traded in fish and visited the then-famous bars. The town had declined in recent decades, as boats with refrigerated storage could bring their catch farther and found less use for the island as an offshore trading post.But with hongeo\u2019s growing popularity, residents began pitching the island as a tourist attraction where people could sample authentic \u201cHeuksan-do hongeo,\u201d and hongeo restaurants have replaced many of the seafront bars. Yoon Sung-jong, 51, the island\u2019s postmaster, said that up to 80 percent of the outbound packages his office handled were hongeo, addressed to mainland restaurants, where a dish of Heuksan Island\u2019s hongeo can go for $150.These days, one of the surest signs of hongeo\u2019s rise to national attention is also a dispiriting one for those who value regional harmony. According to Lee Jeong-bok, a linguist, the word has entered the lexicon of slurs that some Gyeongsang people hurl at their Jeolla neighbors, with the clear implication that Jeolla people are repulsive. (Not to be outdone, some Jeolla people use the name for a Gyeongsang delicacy \u2014 a half-dried mackerel \u2014 to describe their enemies there.)But hongeo has also helped bridge regional prejudices. Some Gyeongsang natives have been drawn to Heuksan Island to sample the fish. And in a good-will gesture in 2005, Park Geun-hye, a Gyeongsang native and aspiring president, sent two hongeo as a gift when a Jeolla politician named Han Hwa-gap was elected head of an opposition party.When Mr. Han switched his allegiance seven years later to support Ms. Park\u2019s bid for the presidency, earning death threats, he cited, among other things, how touched he had been by the symbolism of her gift.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fear Not the Coming of the Robots", "Date": "2014-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJUST over 50 years ago, the cover of Life magazine breathlessly declared the \u201cpoint of no return for everybody.\u201d Above that stark warning, a smaller headline proclaimed, \u201cAutomation\u2019s really here; jobs go scarce.\u201dAs events unfolded, it was Life that was nearing the point of no return \u2014 the magazine suspended weekly publication in 1972. For the rest of America, jobs boomed; in the following decade, 21 million Americans were added to the employment rolls.Throughout history, aspiring Cassandras have regularly proclaimed that new waves of technological innovation would render huge numbers of workers idle, leading to all manner of economic, social and political disruption.As early as 1589, Queen Elizabeth I refused a patent on a knitting machine for fear it would put \u201cmy poor subjects\u201d out of work.In the 1930s, the great John Maynard Keynes predicted widespread job losses \u201cdue to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.\u201dSo far, of course, they\u2019ve all been wrong. But that has not prevented a cascade of shrill new proclamations that \u2014 notwithstanding centuries of history \u2014 \u201cthis time is different\u201d: The technology revolution will impair the livelihoods of millions of Americans.Even The Economist has weighed in, with a special section declaring on its cover that robots are the \u201cimmigrants from the future.\u201dLet\u2019s go back to first principles. Call it automation, call it robots, or call it technology; it all comes down to the concept of producing more with fewer workers. Far from being a scary prospect, that\u2019s a good thing.Becoming more efficient (what economists call \u201cproductivity\u201d) has always been central to a growing economy. Without higher productivity, wages can\u2019t go up and standards of living can\u2019t improve.That\u2019s why, in the sweep of history, the human condition barely improved for centuries, until the early days of the industrial revolution, when transformational new technologies (the robots of their day) were introduced.Consider the case of agriculture, after the arrival of tractors, combines and scientific farming methods. A century ago, about 30 percent of Americans labored on farms; today, the United States is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of agricultural products, even though the sector employs just 2 percent of Americans.The trick is not to protect old jobs, as the Luddites who endeavored to smash all machinery sought to do, but to create new ones. And since the invention of the wheel, that\u2019s what has occurred.When was the last time you talked to a telephone operator? And yet if rotary dial telephones hadn\u2019t been invented, millions of Americans would currently be wastefully employed saying \u201cCentral\u201d every time someone picked up a telephone receiver. More recently but similarly, the Internet has rendered human directory assistance nearly extinct.Of course, I can\u2019t prove that the impact of some new wave of technological innovation won\u2019t ever upend thousands of years of history. But it hasn\u2019t happened yet.If technology were supplanting jobs, productivity \u2014 the measure of each worker\u2019s output \u2014 would be rising sharply. However, that\u2019s not happening. In fact, productivity growth in recent years has been sluggish (an even scarier concern). That has led to fears about the opposite problem, the possibility that technological advances won\u2019t be robust enough to provide the productivity increases needed to sustain income growth.I don\u2019t buy that either. As recently as 30 years ago, few of us would have foreseen the information technology revolution, with the vast gains in efficiency that have flowed from it.To be sure, technology has changed the nature of work \u2014 more specialized training is now required for many jobs \u2014 and consequently, it has contributed to the sharp rise in income inequality.But technology is not the prime culprit behind our languid employment and income growth. That honor belongs to globalization, and particularly the ability of companies to substitute far less expensive and increasingly skilled labor in developing countries.To address these very real challenges, we should be embracing technology, not fearing it. That means educating and training Americans to perform the more skilled jobs that cannot yet be performed by workers in developing countries. And let\u2019s not forget that we are world leaders in industries like education, medicine, technology, entertainment and yes, even financial services.Many of these sectors generate skilled jobs \u2014 nurses, who are in high demand, earn an average of $65,000 per year \u2014 and even substantial export dollars. Of course, not every worker can be retrained, and so we must help those who aren\u2019t suitable for the new jobs through more robust social welfare programs.We mustn\u2019t become a nation of robot worriers. That will merely guarantee that our incomes and standards of living will continue to stagnate.A contributing opinion writer and an investment adviser. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seattle Approves $15 Minimum Wage, Setting a New Standard for Big Cities", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The City Council here went where no big-city lawmakers have gone before on Monday, raising the local minimum wage to $15 an hour, more than double the federal minimum, and pushing Seattle to the forefront of urban efforts to address income inequality.The unanimous vote of the nine-member Council, after months of discussion by a committee of business and labor leaders convened by Mayor Ed Murray, will give low-wage workers here \u2014 in incremental stages, with different tracks for different sizes of business \u2014 the highest big-city minimum in the nation. \u201cEven before the Great Recession a lot of us have started to have doubt and concern about the basic economic promise that underpins economic life in the United States,\u201d said Sally J. Clark, a Council member. \u201cToday Seattle answers that challenge,\u201d she added. \u201cWe go into uncharted, unevaluated territory.\u201dBut some business owners who have questioned the proposal say that the city\u2019s booming economy is creating an illusion of permanence. The fat times and the ability to pay higher wages, they warn, will not go on forever. \u201cWe\u2019re living in this bubble of Amazon, but that\u2019s not going to go on,\u201d said Tom Douglas, a prominent restaurateur in Seattle, referring to the local boom in jobs and economic growth from hiring at Amazon, the online retailer, which has its headquarters here. Mr. Douglas said the new law will inevitably result in costs being passed on to consumers. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some terrific price inflation,\u201d he said.The measure has the support of Mr. Murray, who ran last year on a pledge to raise the wage to $15 and made it one of his first priorities in office.Cheers and jeers repeatedly erupted in the City Hall meeting room, which was packed with supporters of the plan, who often interrupted speakers in the 90-minute debate before the vote with chants. \u201cWe did it \u2014 workers did this,\u201d said Kshama Sawant, a socialist who campaigned for a $15 minimum wage when she was elected to the Council last year. Ms. Sawant sought to accelerate the carrying out of the measure and to strip out a lower youth wage training rate, but the council rejected her proposals. The vote, economists and labor experts said, accentuates the patchwork in wages around the country, with places like Seattle \u2014 and other cities considering sharply higher minimum pay, including San Diego, Chicago and San Francisco \u2014 having economic outlooks increasingly distinct from those in other parts of the nation. Through much of the South, especially, the federal minimum of $7.25 holds fast. Eight states plus the District of Columbia have already increased their minimum wages this year, the most to have done so in a single year since 2006, and at least eight other states and municipalities could put minimum wage ballot measures before voters by November. But it is the scale of ambition that is catching the attention of economists, labor leaders and business owners. \u201cIn past rounds of minimum wage increases, proposals sought chiefly to restore the value of the minimum wage lost to inflation over the decades,\u201d said Paul Sonn, the general counsel and program director at the National Employment Law Project, a New York-based group that supports raising the minimum wage. The increases in places like Seattle, Mr. Sonn said, go beyond playing catch-up. \u201cThe $15 proposals make real gains,\u201d he said. Economists who study the minimum wage are not sure of the effect of having sharply different levels \u2014 in some places, it is twice that of others. Though records are a bit uncertain, people who track minimum wage law say the range of mandated minimums, lowest to highest, is the largest it has been since a national minimum was established by Congress in 1938.\u201cNobody has studied a doubling of the minimum wage \u2014 that\u2019s outside our experience,\u201d said Dale Belman, a professor of labor and industrial relations at Michigan State University and co-author of a coming book about the minimum wage.Individual workers and business owners in and around Seattle are unsure of the implications. Washington State already has the highest state minimum wage in the nation, $9.32, but more than 24 percent of Seattle residents earn hourly wages of $15 or less, according to the city, and approximately 13.6 percent of Seattle residents live below the federal poverty level. Under the plan approved on Monday, the hourly wage will rise to $15 by 2017 for employers with more than 500 workers that do not provide health insurance, and by 2018 for those large employers who do. The minimum will be phased in through 2021 for smaller employers.In its early years, the law allows employers to include tips as part of a workers\u2019 compensation in reaching the minimum, but that provision is phased out over time. \u201cThe short-term side of it says it\u2019s attractive,\u201d said Mickey Adame, a bartender who works in Bellevue, Washington\u2019s fifth-largest city, which is just outside Seattle, and the new $15 wage boundary. \u201cBut I think people in Seattle aren\u2019t going to tip as much, knowing the servers are getting paid $15,\u201d added Mr. Adame, who lives in Seattle and is trying to start a music record label called Sounder Music, for which his tip jar, he said, is crucial. \u201cIf I had to pick an answer, I would say I think I\u2019ll make more in Bellevue.\u201d Ms. Sawant, in her comments to the Council and the crowd, did not take the tone of someone who was savoring a victory. The fight for workers\u2019 rights and economic fairness, she said, is not over.\u201cWe have fought to the last day, the last hour, against all the loopholes demanded by business,\u201d she said. \u201cThe attempts of business to undermine $15 will continue,\u201d she said, as would the battle to \u201cturn the tide against corporate politics.\u201d She added: \u201c$15 in Seattle is just a beginning. We have an entire world to win.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Spiritual Recession", "Date": "2014-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past few centuries, the Western world has witnessed a contest of historic visions. On the one side was the dream of the beautiful collective. Human progress was a one-way march toward socialism. People would liberate themselves from religion, hierarchy and oppression. They would build a new kind of society where equality would be the rule, where rational planning would replace cruel competition. On the other side was the dream of universal democracy. Human progress was seen as a one-way march toward democratic capitalism. Societies would be held together by shared biblical morality. They would be invigorated by economic competition. They would be guided by a democratic state, where power was in the hands of the masses and dispersed through checks and balances. These two historic visions had amazing appeal. Millions of people dedicated their lives to socialism or communism. The democratic gospel was just an idea, but it shaped American history. The founders believed that they were writing a Constitution for a nation that would herald a new order of the ages. Walt Whitman wrote an essay called \u201cDemocratic Vistas\u201d defining the nation\u2019s spiritual mission, while Lincoln celebrated the last, best hope of earth.In the 1930s, the radical Leon Samson explained that Americans never went in big for socialism because they already had a creed, which made them happy, gave them work and made history meaningful. \u201cEvery concept in socialism has its substitutive counter-concept in Americanism,\u201d Samson wrote, \u201cand that is why the socialist argument falls so fruitlessly on the American ear. ... The American does not want to listen to socialism because he thinks he already has it.\u201dHe\u2019s a bit right about that. When the U.S. was a weak nation, Americans dedicated themselves to proving to the world that democracy could last. When the U.S. became a superpower, Americans felt responsible for creating a global order that would nurture the spread of democracy. But now the nation is tired, distrustful, divided and withdrawing. Democratic vistas give way to laissez-faire fatalism: History has no shape. The dream of universal democracy seems na\u00efve. National interest matters most.Lilla\u2019s piece both describes and unfortunately exemplifies the current mood. He argues that the notion of history as a march toward universal democracy is a pipe dream. Arab nations are not going to be democratic anytime soon. The world is an aviary of different systems \u2014 autocracy, mercantile despotism \u2014 and always will be. Instead of worrying about spreading democracy, we\u2019d be better off trying to make theocracies less beastly. Such is life in a spiritual recession. Americans have lost faith in their own gospel. This loss of faith is ruinous from any practical standpoint. The faith bound diverse Americans, reducing polarization. The faith gave elites a sense of historic responsibility and helped them resist the money and corruption that always licked at the political system.Without the vibrant faith, there is no spiritual counterweight to rampant materialism. Without the faith, the left has grown strangely callous and withdrawing in the face of genocide around the world. The right adopts a zero-sum mentality about immigration and a pinched attitude about foreign affairs. Without the faith, leaders grow small; they have no sacred purpose to align themselves with. Young people get fired up by the thought of solar panels in Africa but seem much less engaged in the task of spreading political dignity and humane self-government. Meanwhile, the country grows strangely indifferent to democratic heroes. Decades ago, everyone knew about Sakharov. But how many raised a fuss over the systematic persecution of democratic activists and Christians across the Middle East? The democratic gospel was both lofty and realistic. It had a high historic mission, but it was based on the idea that biblical morality is necessary precisely because people are selfish and shortsighted, capitalism is necessary because economies are too complicated to understand and plan; democracy is necessary because concentrated power is always dangerous, no matter how seductive it seems in the short term. Sure there have been setbacks. But if America isn\u2019t a champion of universal democracy, what is the country for? A great inheritance is being squandered; a 200-year-old language is being left by the side of the road. Advertisement"}

The real lesson from Kansas is the enduring power of bad ideas, as long as those ideas serve the interests of the right people.So how did the charlatans and cranks end up dictating policy in Kansas, and to a more limited extent in other states?

While ALEC supports big income-tax cuts, it calls for increases in the sales tax \u2014 which fall most heavily on lower-income households \u2014 and reductions in tax-based support for working households. So its agenda involves cutting taxes at the top while actually increasing taxes at the bottom, as well as cutting social services.But how can you justify enriching the already wealthy while making life harder for those struggling to get by? The answer is, you need an economic theory claiming that such a policy is the key to prosperity for all.

{"Headline": "Secret Tapes of Politicians Cause a Stir in Poland", "Date": "2014-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 Mysterious tapes of high-level officials discussing what seem to be unsavory deals, recorded in the back room of a restaurant popular with the political elite, are threatening the careers of some of Poland\u2019s most prominent leaders and perhaps even the survival of the current government.Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Monday afternoon described the electronic eavesdropping, which occurred over many months and may have involved several locations, as \u201can attempt at a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, bringing down the Polish government by illegal means,\u201d and called it well organized and unprecedented in Poland\u2019s post-Communist history.Although Mr. Tusk and other officials in the governing party criticized some of the behavior and language contained on the tapes, they focused the bulk of their wrath Monday on the eavesdropping itself.\u201cThe goal of this well-organized crime was not the public good, but eavesdropping on politicians of the ruling party,\u201d Mr. Tusk said.In the most potentially incendiary of the recordings, made last July, Marek Belka, chief of the central bank, chats with Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, the interior minister, about steps the bank might take in an emergency to prop up the national economy, something the minister remarks might be needed to help the governing party win re-election in 2015.Mr. Belka is heard saying that the bank might intervene, but asked that the finance minister at the time, Jacek Rostowski, be replaced by a more apolitical figure. Mr. Rostowski was in fact replaced last fall by a bank economist with no previous political experience.Under Polish law, the central bank is to remain independent of politics.\u201cWe are facing extraordinary and outrageous events,\u201d said Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the chief opposition party, Law and Justice. \u201cThe only proper reaction should be the dismissal of the government.\u201dIf Mr. Tusk does not step down, Mr. Kaczynski said, he will call for a no-confidence vote in Parliament.Poland\u2019s top prosecutor, Andrzej Seremet, said Monday that while his office would study the tapes \u2014 so far, he said, it had only seen the transcripts \u2014 he did not, at the moment, see any basis to investigate Mr. Belka and Mr. Sienkiewicz.There would, however, be a case to be made against whoever had recorded the conversations.\u201cI agree that the analysis of the conversation does not point to any violation of law,\u201d Mr. Tusk said, adding that he would not fire Mr. Sienkiewicz. \u201cOf course, the style of these talks is quite scandalous.\u201dBlunt, sometimes profane language, however, is \u201cpart of the normal, unofficial give-and-take in the way politics is conducted,\u201d he said, especially when the participants are all men and believe they are speaking in private.Reached while traveling in Israel by a Polish radio journalist, Mr. Belka said that the tape had been edited and taken out of context.\u201cI do not deny using the expressions which are printed in the weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the context was much broader. We were most of all talking about particular situations which happen very rarely.\u201d\u201cThose who read this as a dirty case \u2014 the truth is, I don\u2019t think they understand,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, what is important is the question of the financial security of the country, and I think we spoke precisely about this.\u201dOn a second tape, which the paper said was recorded in February, a former government official is heard discussing a tax investigation of his wife\u2019s business with a deputy finance minister. The minister, Andrzej Parafianowicz, who has since left the government, assured the former official that he had personally \u201cblocked\u201d the investigation.That conversation, Mr. Seremet said, does appear to show illegal activity, if Mr. Parafianowicz did what he claimed.Anatol Magdziarz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The Adler regime came to power on the backs of scads of slackers who had not previously given two whits about how their homes were designed but were now making enough money thanks to the hipster economy that to continue in ignorance would be an error, but to give in to shabby chic or even all-midcentury-modern-everything would be, you know, lame.Enter cheek: the sort of home d\u00e9cor that\u2019s both prim and also disruptive, thanks to the use of provocative colors or trims or language. But there\u2019s nothing transcendent about this cheap kitsch, no visible hand of aesthetic agency. And so a countermaneuver was destined, and it has arrived in the form of a revival of handcrafted home items: pottery and dishes and cutlery and so on. It\u2019s also an extension of the yen for artisanal food, a yen for something artisanal (or at least unique) to eat it out of.That leads to a store like Joinery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which in addition to carrying men\u2019s and women\u2019s high-end utility clothing features a host of items for a well-ordered home. That includes hearty wide walnut display bowls by Tenebras ($90), a beautiful white enamel colander by Reiss ($68), and of course, a hexagonal teak candlestick ($35). (I mean, you can\u2019t throw a Birkenstock without hitting a hexagonal candlestick these days.)Of the recent crop of Williamsburg housewares entrants, Joinery is the most earnest. At the other end of the spectrum is Beam, part of the Shops at 240 Kent mini-mall, which embodies design in a post-Adler world, keeping elements of his fanciful approach but mostly without its blunt force. There were surprisingly lovely silicone vessels with long, thin tops that ended in a point (as if they held a violent tagine) in chirpy colors ($140), and a smart Pablo lamp with a Lucite base (in bold fluorescent colors like pink and green) with a rectangular fabric shade ($125). Also by Pablo, the Pixo table lamp, a circular head like the U.F.O. in \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d atop a slender arm, fully adjustable and in bright colors ($199). I also loved the multipiece desk organizer in the shape of a ship ($64).Less interesting were the hybrid bone china plates by Seletti, gluing together halves of two styles to make a gauche whole. On the fence was a camouflage Chesterfield easy chair ($1,449). If it\u2019s your one outr\u00e9 item of furniture, then great, but if it\u2019s part of a loud chorus, maybe reconsider your vision.There\u2019s a fine line between cute and cutesy, and Beam isn\u2019t scared of wobbling on it. You can certainly buy a stuffed doll of Picasso, or Biggie Smalls, or Coco Chanel ($42). On the wall, and for sale, were framed preserved butterflies in electric blue ($468), in case trad taxidermy is too hairy and artisanal for you. These aren\u2019t items that will make your home, or that take a stand, but they may communicate to someone that you think that you have.Once you have learned the distinction between those two things, you can go a few blocks away, to Abode New York, for a maturity upgrade and where, yes, I bought place mats. Beautiful place mats, made of multicolor basket-woven PVC yarn. And a beautiful white and aubergine salad bowl by ASA Selection, a German manufacturer that pairs dignity with panache.Abode exists on the accessible end of the design-degree universe. A tubular pendant light in primary colors by Cilandro ($255), a rubber tissue dispenser by Tunell, a waterdrop trivet by Toma ($45): all items you can display proudly, and that wink casually, not face-transmogrifyingly.Still, the charm of these pieces is largely digital. Almost certainly, they were designed on a computer, even if it was one with, like, an X-Girl sticker on it. If you want to see hands in action, you have to leave Williamsburg for Boerum Hill and the Primary Essentials, which is a shrine of the small batch. Surely you would like your morning muesli in one of the infinity bowls by Clam Lab ($120 for set of three), which look better cupped in your hand than on some dusty old table.Chen Williams has porcelain bowls made from a cast of a cantaloupe ($98), Nicholas Newcomb has a range of rough-molded ceramic spoons, and Helen Levi has a multicolor paint-splattered pitcher ($136) \u2014 all striking.

{"Headline": "U.S. Economic Recovery Looks Distant as Growth Stalls", "Date": "2014-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Recessions are always painful, but the Great Recession that ran from late 2007 to the middle of 2009 may have inflicted a new kind of pain: an era of slower growth.It has been five years since the official end of that severe economic downturn. The nation\u2019s total annual output has moved substantially above the prerecession peak, but economic growth has averaged only about 2 percent a year, well below its historical average. Household incomes continue to stagnate, and millions of Americans still can\u2019t find jobs. And a growing number of experts see evidence that the economy will never rebound completely.For more than a century, the pace of growth was reliably resilient, bouncing back after recessions like a car returning to its cruising speed after a roadblock. Even after the prolonged Great Depression of the 1930s, growth eventually returned to an average pace of more than 3 percent a year. But Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, citing the Congressional Budget Office, said on Wednesday that the government now expected annual growth to average just 2.1 percent, about two-thirds of the previous pace.\u201cMany today wonder whether something that has always been true in our past will be true in our future,\u201d Mr. Lew told members of the Economic Club of New York. \u201cThere are questions about whether America can maintain strong rates of growth and doubts about whether the benefits of technology, innovation and prosperity will be shared broadly.\u201dThe most recent recession and the slow recovery have \u201cleft lasting scars on the economy,\u201d the Labor Department concluded late last year in a report that declared slower growth \u201cthe new normal\u201d for the American economy. The Federal Reserve, persistently optimistic in its previous forecasts, said in March that it no longer expected a full recovery in the foreseeable future.Five years since the end of the recession, many states still haven\u2019t returned to, or neared, their previous levels of unemployment.The pessimism is a striking departure from economic orthodoxy. Recessions cause considerable suffering, including permanent disruptions to individual lives, but most economists have long asserted that recessions do not reduce the economy\u2019s capacity to supply goods and services.Some economists still expect a complete recovery. They say it takes a long time to recover from financial crises, and that the healing process has been set back unexpectedly by cuts in government spending, by Europe\u2019s woes and, most recently, by a hard winter.Other economists, also committed to the orthodox view of recessions, argue that the slower growth is here to stay, but say that it is the result of longer-term trends that predate the recession, like fewer Americans entering the work force and less innovation.\u201cWe have recovered\u201d from the recession, said Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University. \u201cWe just don\u2019t like what that looks like.\u201dThe emerging view espoused by an eclectic range of economists \u2014 including Mr. Summers; Paul Krugman of Princeton and an Op-Ed page columnist for The New York Times; and Robert E. Hall of Stanford University\u2019s conservative Hoover Institution \u2014 accepts that slower growth is partly the result of long-term trends. It is an unfortunate coincidence, in effect, that just as the floor was giving way, the ceiling was falling, too.But these analysts also see mounting evidence that recessions, and slow recoveries, can have enduring consequences.Much of the scrutiny has focused on the labor market. The share of adults with jobs fell sharply during the recession and has rebounded only slightly because many people have simply stopped looking for work. The situation is likely to improve somewhat as the economy gains strength, but part of the decline is tied to factors that are more permanent.They include the share of Americans claiming federal disability benefits, which rose sharply in recent years. Few of those people will ever return to the work force after receiving benefits. At the same time, fewer immigrants have been arriving. There are almost two million fewer people over the age of 16 than the federal government had projected back in 2007.The recession also reduced the number of future workers. The birthrate has declined each year from 2007 to 2012, the most recent for which data is available.Economic prosperity is determined not just by the number of workers but, even more important, by their output per hour of work. There is growing speculation that decisions made in the wake of the recession have weakened that output, too.Government spending and public investment has fallen by almost 8 percent, the largest decline in more than half a century. Corporate investment has also been lackluster.This view remains controversial. \u201cProductivity forecasts have had no success historically,\u201d Mr. Hall wrote in his recent analysis. \u201cWhether the return to a normal economy will result in a catch-up in productivity growth in the longer term is an unsettled question.\u201dAnother unsettled question is whether the federal government can help.The paper, which sought to formalize recent conceptualizing about so-called secular stagnation, argued that in a normal cycle, falling interest rates would eventually generate sufficient demand to restore the economy to its historical growth rate.Five years since the end of the Great Recession, the private sector has finally regained the nine million jobs it lost. But not all industries recovered equally.But the Fed has held interest rates near zero since late 2008 and there has been no such rebound. The researchers concluded that the economy might experience \u201ca permanent slump in output\u201d without bold new measures to spur investment, like a large increase in government spending or higher inflation.Mr. Lew, the Treasury secretary, argued on Wednesday that smaller steps, like increased immigration and improved education, could help too.\u201cThe choices we make over the years to come can alter this projection\u201d of slower growth, he said.There is little prospect a divided Congress will embrace either approach, but there are still some reasons for optimism. For all his doubt about the current outlook, Mr. Cowen, author of \u201cAverage Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation\u201d (Dutton, 2013), expects that some existing innovations, and some as yet undreamed, will eventually drive faster growth.Just not very soon. \u201cIf you\u2019re 40 now,\u201d Mr. Cowen said, \u201cI don\u2019t see why you ever see it, or enjoy it as a worker.\u201dWhile worried about a slowdown, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, sees even odds over the next five years that the economy will grow more quickly.\u201cI don\u2019t believe the U.S. economy can remain for a long time in secular stagnation,\u201d Mr. El-Erian, who correctly predicted the current malaise in 2009, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s like a car that has to be either in fourth gear or in neutral. There\u2019s too much leverage in the system. If we don\u2019t get growth, the leverage becomes an issue. If we don\u2019t grow out of our debts, the debt is going to discourage economic activity and we\u2019re going to have trouble growing 2 percent a year.\u201dFinally, while it is human nature to assume trends will persist, they often don\u2019t.During the 1930s, many economists predicted that growth would not resume its earlier pace. Alvin Hansen, a Harvard University professor, coined the term \u201csecular stagnation\u201d to describe his view that changed circumstances, including a lower birthrate, would prevent a full recovery.Mr. Hansen was spectacularly wrong. After World War II, the number of babies boomed \u2014 and so did the economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Reality of Student Debt Is Different From the Clich\u00e9s", "Date": "2014-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStarting From BehindThe deeply indebted college graduate has become a stock character in the national conversation: the art history major with $50,000 in debt, the underemployed barista with $75,000, the struggling poet with $100,000.The anecdotes have created the impression that such high levels of student debt are typical. But they\u2019re not. They are outliers, and they\u2019re warping our understanding of bigger economic problems.The vastly bigger problem is the hundreds of thousands of people who emerge from college with a modest amount of debt yet no degree. For them, college is akin to a house that they had to make the down payment on but can\u2019t live in. In a cost-benefit calculation, they get only the cost. And they are far, far more numerous than bachelor\u2019s degree holders with huge debt burdens.The solutions to the dropout crisis have some overlap with the solutions to the so-called student-debt crisis: more accountability for colleges. For the most part, though, the two issues are different \u2014 and require different answers. Lifting the nation\u2019s college graduation rate depends on better, more cost-effective education, rather than merely cheaper education.I realize that the stories of student debt are so common and visceral that many readers will view the Brookings argument with some skepticism. So let me walk through it.The first thing to acknowledge is that student debt has risen over the last two decades. In 2010, 36 percent of households with people between the ages of 20 and 40 had education debt, up from 14 percent in 1989. The median amount of debt \u2014 among those with debt \u2014 more than doubled, to $8,500 from $3,517, after adjusting for inflation.But even with tuition rising, several other factors have helped hold down debt burdens. The incomes of college graduates have grown since the early 1990s. And the repayment time for many loans has become longer. This combination creates perhaps the most surprising fact from the Brookings data:The share of income that a typical student debtor has to devote to loan payments is only marginally higher than it was in the early 1990s \u2014 and somewhat lower than it was in late 1990s. It was 3.5 percent in 1992, 4.3 percent in 1998 and 4 percent in 2010.Maybe even more surprisingly, the burden for the people with the most debt is significantly lower today than two decades ago. Someone at the 90th percentile of debt had to devote 15 percent of her income to repayment in 2010, down from 20 percent in 1992.What explains the widely held notion to the contrary? I think it stems in large part from the fact that Americans are legitimately frustrated about the economy\u2019s performance over the last 15 years. But when you start looking at the evidence that blames student debt, it can be flimsy.\u201cThe evidence,\u201d Ms. Akers says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t support the notion that student loan debt is creating a drag on the economy.\u201dWith all this being said, the Brookings paper does contain a true cause for concern: \u201cAmong households with some college but no bachelor\u2019s degree, the incidence of debt increased from 11 to 41 percent.\u201d The average amount of debt among this group also more than doubled over the last two decades. Some members of the group are thriving community-college graduates, but more are college dropouts.If you want to argue that American universities charge too much money for too little education, you can make a pretty good case. But the people paying the real price for those failings aren\u2019t the ones who fit the clich\u00e9s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data Readings Converge to Show an Economy Regaining Momentum", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, the weather has dominated discourse about the economy. Analysts attributed the dearth of shoppers, the weak employment numbers and the overall decline in economic activity to the cold and snow in the eastern half of the nation, the freakish storms in the South and Midwest, and the drought in the West.But finally a set of numbers is emerging that takes the temperature of the economy without the taint of severe weather. And while some of the data is disappointing \u2014 for starters, exports slowed in April and productivity gains have been modest \u2014 over all the economy appears to be getting back on a moderate growth path after the setbacks of the first quarter.\u201cYou\u2019re getting an underlying look at what the economy looks like,\u201d said John Canally, an economist for LPL Financial. \u201cAnd it looks good, though it\u2019s not all the way back to where it\u2019s been.\u201dThe exports declined from March by 0.2 percent, as the imports rose 1.2 percent, driven by an increase in consumer goods, capital goods, automotive vehicles, parts and engines, as well as food and beverages and other items.The numbers, along with other statistics released in recent days, indicate an upswing in business activity and expectations for greater spending in the months ahead, economists said. That is a silver lining to the clouds over the economy generated by the nation\u2019s overall inability to produce enough domestically to match the demand for consumer goods from abroad.\u201cRising imports are not a sign of economic weakness,\u201d said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc. \u201cTo the contrary, it\u2019s a sign of economic demand.\u201dEconomists are already looking ahead to the Labor Department\u2019s jobs report for May, which will be released Friday morning. But already there are signs that things are moving in a better direction. Some of the data released on Wednesday fell short of expectations but was viewed as consistent with solid growth in the second quarter after the pace of economic activity fell at an annual rate of 1 percent in the first quarter.New numbers show that productivity, which measures the output of the economy per hours worked, has slowed since 2012. Nonfarm business sector productivity fell at a 3.2 percent yearly rate in the first quarter. Output fell 1.1 percent even though hours worked grew 2.2 percent.The release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s so-called Beige Book reinforced the picture of an economy generally expanding nearly everywhere in the country. The report, compiled by the Fed\u2019s 12 regional districts and issued about two weeks ahead of each of the central bank\u2019s regular monetary policy meetings, characterized growth as moderate in its Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco districts, and said growth elsewhere was modest. The Kansas City area was the only district that slowed slightly compared with the previous report.Based on informal surveys of local businesses, the Fed\u2019s regional banks found that consumer spending was continuing to expand, though it was held back to varying degrees by a late Easter and late spring. Non-auto retail sales grew at a healthy clip. The Fed report said lingering wintry weather weighed on sales in parts of Boston and New York.The spring season is generally when the real estate market kicks into high gear, but the Fed report found that residential housing activity was mixed as low inventories slowed sales in areas like New York and Kansas City.For instance, in New York, Broadway shows were bringing in significantly more people and money than last year, reflecting an increase in the number of shows as well as in tourism. But the city\u2019s information technology sector appears to be suffering from a shortage of workers available for hire.On the West Coast, a fatal hog virus is plaguing the district, driving up pork prices, and the region\u2019s farmers are struggling from too little rain. But Midwestern districts are being drenched by too much rain. In West Virginia, a closed coal mine has reopened because of strong demand from European and Chinese customers.\u201cThe Beige Book isn\u2019t so much a road map as a history lesson,\u201d said Lawrence R. Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. \u201cIt\u2019s always fascinating reading. The job of investors is to figure out what happens next.\u201dOther economists have devised their own methods for interpreting the fine print of the 50-page report. Mr. Canally, of LPL Financial, counted the 34 mentions of weather in Wednesday\u2019s report, noting that most were in a positive light about improved conditions. March\u2019s Beige Book, by contrast, mentioned the weather\u2019s negative impacts in almost all of the 119 times it was cited, he said.Small businesses added an estimated 82,000 jobs, ADP said. Manufacturing added 10,000 jobs and construction added 14,000 jobs.While the report, which usually comes out only a couple of days ahead of the government\u2019s jobs report, is closely watched for clues to the official data, the connection between the two is fairly unreliable, economists point out. Last month, ADP\u2019s report indicated far lower numbers than the big jump that ultimately came out in the government\u2019s jobs report. Economists are predicting a robust increase in payrolls, perhaps of 200,000 or more, when the jobs numbers are released on Friday.But many were also expecting the unemployment rate, which fell to 6.3 percent in April, to rise for May if the improving economy has encouraged more people who had dropped out of the work force, where they are no longer counted as unemployed, to start looking for work again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rare Frederick Ashton Revival, Hell and a Garden Party", "Date": "2014-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDance ReviewThe ballet, however, is not a literal depiction of the events in the \u201cInferno.\u201d The designs, by Ashton\u2019s frequent collaborator Sophie Fedorovitch, recall the line drawings of John Flaxman for the \u201cDivine Comedy,\u201d and the sculptural groupings and floating figures of the ballet have something of the same abstract economy. White stairs and puffs of smoke or clouds are the lightly sketched backdrop to the ballet\u2019s two groups, who confront one another in a series of tormented encounters.First come the Children of Light, the women in simple white dresses, the men in billowing shirts over tights. They are halted by the Children of Darkness, men and women who have black snakes coiled across their torsos and legs. Ashton\u2019s physical language is surprising: gestural, grounded, probably influenced by Isadora Duncan. The women toss their unbound hair, run in galloping, broken rhythms, gesture emphatically. The men fight \u2014 pummeling prone bodies with fists, creating sculptural groupings with images of crucifixion, shame, mass death. Ashton is careful not to insert a note of hope; at the end the male leaders of both factions are lifted high, dead. All is waste and destruction.\u201cLes Rendezvous,\u201d the opening ballet, and \u201cFa\u00e7ade\u201d have both proved more enduring, even though neither ballet is much performed now. \u201cThe more trivial the subject matter, the deeper and more beautiful is Ashton\u2019s poetic view of it,\u201d the dance critic Edwin Denby once wrote of Ashton\u2019s choreography, and that is certainly borne out in \u201cRendezvous.\u201d The ballet, an onstage garden party, seems initially insubstantial. Friends arrive for the party and greet one another. The host and hostess arrive. There are encounters, a romantic pas de deux, a pert quartet, solos for the principals. All is frothy and light, as is the music, from Daniel Auber\u2019s opera \u201cL\u2019Enfant Prodigue,\u201d arranged by Constant Lambert for the ballet.But \u201cLes Rendezvous\u201d is also a kind of master-class in Ashton technique and style. The patterning of the corps de ballet is gorgeous, folding in and out of kaleidoscopic geometries. And the choreography is full of the details that distinguish his work; the elaborate use of the wrist and hand, the detailed \u00e9paulement (the angles, in relation to one another, of the shoulder, head and hips), the bending upper body, the neat, fluent, fiendishly difficult footwork.\u201cFa\u00e7ade\u201d is also tough to get right. The piece began life as a 1923 collaboration between the composer and Edith Sitwell, who recited her poems over Walton\u2019s music. When Ashton decided to create the ballet, he asked Walton to refashion the music into a suite, and abandoned the poems. But the non-sequitur series of whimsical divertissements borrows from the absurdity of Sitwell\u2019s text without strict narrative adherence. The ballet begins with a trio doing a Highland fling, continues with a polka in which the ballerina drops her skirt, parodies a debutante ball waltz, and \u2014 its best bit, called \u201cPopular Song\u201d \u2014 gives us two men in a deadpan music-hall double act.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congress Versus Hobbit", "Date": "2014-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet\u2019s talk about tax reform.Come back! This is going to be really interesting. Or at least I will try to trick you into feeling that it\u2019s interesting by making copious references to popular culture.We should begin with Representative Dave Camp, a Republican from Michigan who is the current chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. Camp has been on a quest to make the tax system cleaner and simpler. In this matter we might think of him as a Hobbit, facing great danger in his search for the golden W-2 form.\u201cI aim to launch and fight the tax reform battle once again,\u201d Camp announced, rather grandly. After many, many hearings and discussions, he unveiled a proposal to reduce the nation\u2019s high corporate tax rate by eliminating loopholes that allow a number of corporations to avoid paying anything at all.It was, if not supremely heroic, at least a nice principled stand. Like on \u201cMad Men,\u201d when Don Draper gave Peggy the chance to do the presentation for the Burger Chef account. Camp\u2019s plan raised taxes on banks. It nibbled away at many sacred cows, even the mortgage deduction. The Democrats did not love his approach, but a lot of them gave the chairman credit for trying.The Republicans, however, hated the idea of irritating so many powerful special interests just to create a simpler, tidier tax system. John Boehner, asked about Camp\u2019s plan at a press conference, famously responded: \u201cBlah, blah, blah, blah.\u201d This was a betrayal somewhat similar to the moment in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d when Lord Walder Frey assassinated his new in-laws at his daughter\u2019s wedding. \u201cIt went down the toilet!\u201d said an unsurprised Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. The last time Congress actually managed to pass serious tax reform, Ornstein noted, was in 1986. Good old 1986. Tom Cruise was flying around in \u201cTop Gun,\u201d William Shatner was transporting whales in \u201cStar Trek IV\u201d and former New York Knicks star Bill Bradley was simplifying the tax code in the Senate.\u201cFind me a Bill Bradley now,\u201d Ornstein challenged.Actually, I found Bill Bradley himself, who was happy to reminisce. His interest in tax reform, he said, stemmed from the fact that \u201cas a basketball player I was a depreciable asset.\u201d Truly, our tax code is a thing of wonder. Do you think Batman gets to write off Robin? I digress. Congress 2014 was definitely not up to a 1986-style effort. Reform went nowhere. So how do you think Dave Camp responded?He marched into a committee meeting and took up $300 billion worth of temporary tax breaks that were due to expire. Most were things he had proposed eliminating or cutting back on in his principled tax plan. Camp then asked that all of them be made permanent.This made no sense at all. The biggest of the temporary breaks allows businesses to get half the depreciation write-off on the cost of new equipment right away. Some people believe that during recessions, this helps jump-start the economy. Many experts doubt it really works. Either way, you obviously destroy the incentive to speed up purchases if the fire sale lasts forever. \u201cThis is not failure of tax reform,\u201d Camp told the committee. \u201cThis is incremental progress on tax reform.\u201d It was sort of a shock. Like the time on \u201cScandal\u201d when Olivia Pope found out that her beloved deceased mother was actually a sinister anti-American spy being held in a secret prison. Camp\u2019s theory was that he was dealing a blow to Congress\u2019s habit of continually passing temporary tax cuts. Temporary tax cuts are not paid for. It\u2019s a magical thing, like the appearance of food in the dining room at Hogwarts.By making the tax cuts permanent, Camp argued, he would be forcing his colleagues to come up with the money needed to fund them. Or not. \u201cRepublicans care deeply about deficits, unless they\u2019re caused by tax cuts. Then they don\u2019t give a damn,\u201d said Ornstein.At least it made for an unusually interesting committee meeting. One of the tax breaks \u2014 which Camp wanted to kill until he wanted to extend it forever \u2014 allowed companies to take a write-off for donating unsold food to food banks. The Democrats warned that Congress was encouraging businesses to foist their \u201cstale potato chips and Twinkies\u201d on to the innocent poor. Republican Tom Reed of New York retorted that some of those aging snacks were going to needy \u201cchildren and their birthday parties.\u201dOn party-line votes, Ways and Means followed Camp\u2019s lead. The House Republicans are now on their way to approving permanent tax cuts that would add about $600 billion to the deficit over 10 years. It will make a lot of corporations happy, but, as a plan, it\u2019s like \u2014 wow, what do you think? Walter White\u2019s idea on \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d to pay his hospital bills by selling meth? Something about vampires or zombies? Feel free to fill in the blank. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and European Job Markets Take Different Paths", "Date": "2014-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsMORE than five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September intensified a credit crisis, the labor market in the United States has almost recovered \u2014 at least as measured by the number of unemployed people. But in most of Europe, the number of jobless workers remains substantially higher than it was then.Over all, the number of unemployed workers in the United States was 3 percent higher in May than it was in September 2008. In Germany, where employment fell less than in the United States during the crisis and then rose faster in the recovery, the number of unemployed workers is down by 25 percent. But in every other country in the euro zone, unemployment remains higher, often by large amounts, than it was then. The number of people looking for work in Spain is now double the level of September 2008, and the figure is Italy in nearly as bad. In France, unemployment is 40 percent higher than it was then. But Spanish unemployment has declined a little since it peaked in 2011, while in both Italy and France the number of people out of work is at or near a record high.In Britain, which is not in the euro zone, the number of unemployed workers remains 16 percent above where it was when Lehman failed, although the number has been falling in recent months.Perhaps surprisingly, given the attention given to the problem of high unemployment among younger workers, the number of unemployed people under 25 has generally risen less than the number of unemployed older workers. In the United States, in May the youth figure was 5 percent lower than it was in the fall of 2008.Unemployment rates \u2014 based on the number of people with jobs compared with the number who are working or looking for work \u2014 remain higher than they were. In the United States, the overall rate was 6.3 percent in May, compared with 6.1 percent in September 2008. The rate for younger workers was actually lower than it had been then.Adult unemployment rates help to show how much European economic performance diverged as the credit crisis intensified and was then followed by the euro zone crisis. In September 2008, the unemployment rate for the euro zone countries other than Germany was 6.8 percent, only a little higher than the 6.5 percent rate in Germany. In April, the German rate was down to 4.9 percent, while the rest of the euro zone had a rate of 12.7 percent, nearly twice as high.There have been signs of improvement in the euro zone outside of Germany. Unemployment rates have been slowly falling since early last year, and the economies grew at a slow rate for three consecutive quarters, before slipping a bit in the first quarter of 2014. But the slow pace of that recovery was a major reason that the European Central Bank this week took steps to force banks to increase their lending to businesses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Smart Way to Skip College in Pursuit of a Job", "Date": "2014-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneCould an online degree earned in six to 12 months bring a revolution to higher education?This week, AT&T and Udacity, the online education company founded by the Stanford professor and former Google engineering whiz Sebastian Thrun, announced something meant to be very small: the \u201cNanoDegree.\u201dAt first blush, it doesn\u2019t appear like much. For $200 a month, it is intended to teach anyone with a mastery of high school math the kind of basic programming skills needed to qualify for an entry-level position at AT&T as a data analyst, iOS applications designer or the like.Yet this most basic of efforts may offer more than simply adding an online twist to vocational training. It may finally offer a reasonable shot at harnessing the web to provide effective schooling to the many young Americans for whom college has become a distant, unaffordable dream.Intriguingly, it suggests that the best route to democratizing higher education may require taking it out of college.\u201cWe are trying to widen the pipeline,\u201d said Charlene Lake, an AT&T spokeswoman. \u201cThis is designed by business for the specific skills that are needed in business.\u201dMr. Thrun sounded more ambitious about the ultimate goal: \u201cIt is like a university,\u201d he told me, \u201cbuilt by industry.\u201dBut this very statistic underscores the depth of the nation\u2019s educational deficit. One reason for the enormous payoff from a college degree, which is almost twice as big as it was in 1979, Mr. Autor finds, is that too few young Americans \u2014 despite a bump in enrollment right after the Great Recession \u2014 ever earn one.With tuition rising around the country and states cutting the budgets of their public university systems, many disadvantaged students are left at the mercy of unscrupulous degree mills that promise good jobs on graduation but often discharge young adults with only limited employment prospects and a crushing burden of debt.It is easy to oversell technology\u2019s ability to close some of these gaps. When they were introduced a few years ago, the Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs, offered by the likes of Udacity, Coursera or edX, the joint venture between Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were promoted as the best way to close the opportunity gap.But putting traditional college courses online may do little to close the gap. Instead, the evidence so far suggests that online education may do better in giving low-income students a leg up if it is directly tied to work. And companies, rather than colleges, may be best suited to shape the curriculum.Moreover, those engaging with online education mostly have not been the young people who might benefit most from the free coursework. \u201cThe people who have taken up these opportunities are not the needy of the world,\u201d said Fiona M. Hollands of Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College. \u201cThey are not democratizing education. They are making courses widely available, but the wrong crowd is showing up.\u201dBut even if MOOCs have failed to deliver on their original promise to educate the poor, they have proved more effective with another slice of the population: Americans who may already have a higher education and a job, but who feel the need to acquire new skills to progress in their careers.Udacity was the first to move in this direction, focusing on a more humble business model helping companies create MOOCs to train their workers and customers.Google, for instance, teamed with Udacity to create MOOCs for programmers who work on Google platforms.

Udacity is also creating NanoDegrees with other companies.If all goes according to plan, Mr. Thrun says, Udacity will ultimately create an alternative approach to the \u201cfour years and done\u201d model of higher education, splitting it into chunks that students can take throughout their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s a more focused education with less time wasted,\u201d Mr. Thrun told me. \u201cThey can get a degree quickly, get a job and then maybe do it again.\u201dThis isn\u2019t the kind of educational pathway that encourages much smelling of the roses.

(She \u201cgot it wrong,\u201d she writes of that vote. \u201cPlain and simple.\u201d) \u201cHard Choices\u201d seems meant to serve several purposes at once: to document Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state; to put her dysfunctional 2008 presidential campaign in the rearview mirror; to supplant memories of her tumultuous days as first lady (Whitewater, Monica Lewinsky) with images of her negotiating with leaders on the world stage; and to lift her above the partisan mudslinging of Washington.The only chapter in which Mrs. Clinton sounds defensive or defiant is the one on the 2012 attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya \u2014 the subject of continuing investigations by House Republicans, bent on asserting that President Obama and Mrs. Clinton covered up what they knew about the causes of the attack. \u201cI will not be a part of a political slugfest on the backs of dead Americans,\u201d she writes. More positive developments like the diplomatic and economic isolation of Iran are described in considerable detail, while more controversial subjects like drone warfare and the data collection programs of the National Security Agency get only cursory, talking-points treatment. Beltway readers will not learn much new here about matters like the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the war in Afghanistan or its counterterrorism policies. For readers who are less policy-oriented, there are personal tidbits strewn lightly throughout, like small chocolate Easter eggs. Mrs. Clinton tells us that she would fight jet lag by sometimes digging \u201cthe fingernails of one hand into the palm of the other\u201d; that she kept the raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s hide-out secret from her husband (\u201cThey told me not to tell anyone, so I didn\u2019t tell anyone\u201d); that President Obama once called her aside before an international meeting for what she thought was a sensitive consultation, only to hear him whisper in her ear, \u201cYou\u2019ve got something in your teeth.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s views are perceived as often more hawkish than Mr. Obama\u2019s, and in these pages, she walks a delicate line between being his loyal lieutenant and articulating her own beliefs. She takes a hard line on Mr. Putin, writing that \u201chard men present hard choices\u201d and \u201cstrength and resolve were the only language\u201d that the Russian leader understood. Of her unsuccessful argument within the administration for arming and training moderate Syrian rebels, she writes: \u201cNo one likes to lose a debate, including me. But this was the President\u2019s call and I respected his deliberations and decision.\u201d Addressing much-chronicled tensions between the State Department and White House advisers, Mrs. Clinton enumerates some of her differences with them in the book \u2014 including her counsel of caution to Mr. Obama in pressing President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to step aside in the face of mounting street protests in Cairo. She also writes that it was painful to see her old friend Richard Holbrooke, the veteran diplomat she had chosen to handle the Afghanistan-Pakistan portfolio, \u201cmarginalized and undercut\u201d by younger White House aides who disliked his flamboyant, old-school style. Of her own plans \u2014 to run or not to run for president \u2014 Mrs. Clinton writes that she has not decided yet. It\u2019s \u201canother hard choice\u201d coming up.

So he makes sure to keep plantains on hand as well as a growing selection of fresh fruits and vegetables: lettuce, broccoli, green peppers, onions, celery, pineapples, strawberries.Mr. Ortiz gets all his fresh fruits and vegetables from Jetro Cash and Carry, a wholesale warehouse in Hunts Point that has long been city bodegas\u2019 go-to source for cereals, paper towels, bottled waters and other staples with long shelf lives. In recent years, the warehouse has responded to changing appetites by significantly expanding its fresh produce and meat offerings, adding a fish and seafood market, and sponsoring health fairs and cooking demonstrations that teach bodega owners to make, for example, salad with grilled tilapia.Now Jetro is teaming up with City Harvest, a nonprofit that collects excess food for pantries and soup kitchens; Hostos Community College; and city health officials on a new effort to promote healthy eating in poor neighborhoods, where supermarkets can be scarce and access to fresh food even more so. This summer, a store display of fresh produce will be created at the warehouse to encourage bodega owners to recreate it in their stores. There are also plans for a \u201cBodegueros Institute\u201d that would teach free classes on handling and selling fresh foods, imparting information like tomatoes need not be refrigerated.\u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty novel partnership to reach this economic niche \u2014 the bodega owners \u2014 we really take for granted,\u201d said Sally Cooper, a program director for City Harvest. \u201cThey\u2019re beloved in their neighborhoods. We think of them as anchor institutions that are helping to hold their neighborhoods together.\u201dRamon Murphy, president of the Bodega Association of the United States, which is based in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, said that New York City\u2019s 12,000 bodegas play a vital role in supporting the local economy. He estimated that a typical bodega employs four to seven workers and averages $15,000 to $30,000 in sales a week, generating much-needed sales tax revenue for municipal coffers.The Hunts Point warehouse is the flagship for Jetro Holdings, a fast-growing nationwide chain of 108 wholesale warehouses that carry the name Jetro, Restaurant Depot or a combination of both; there are five in New York City. The company, which is controlled by the South African business magnate Nathan Kirsh, caters to urban bodegas that have neither the space nor the refrigeration capacity for large inventories: It allows them to replenish supplies as often as needed, with no minimum orders or delivery fees (Jetro has no delivery at all).Jetro, which has operated in Hunts Point since 1985, moved to a new 200,000-square-foot building in 2012 that more than doubled its size. Bodega owners troll for bargains in enormous aisles \u2014 some as long as two football fields \u2014 packed to the ceiling with Goya black beans and Little Debbie honey buns as well as specialty items like halal chicken, cured pork tails and frozen whole goats.Felix Rodriguez, 62, the owner of La Gondola Deli in the Bronx, said he initially got so turned around in the warehouse that he left by an exit on a different side than he had entered on, and was convinced his car had been stolen. (Store workers had to help him find it). He spent several days learning where to find everything, including the plantains, pineapples, bananas and strawberries that his customers request.\u201cYou have to satisfy the customer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they come back the next week and you don\u2019t have what they want, they\u2019re not coming back.\u201dJetro does not advertise to the general public, and sells only to members, though membership in this case is more of a technicality: It is offered free to anyone with a business license. The doors open seven days a week, starting at 2 a.m. on weekdays for those who want to avoid checkout lines, or simply do not have anyone to mind the bodega while they shop.Jack Sagen, sales director for Jetro, said the company has increasingly sought to help bodegas stock healthy options for their customers. City health workers have tagged items in its warehouses that meet a city-approved nutritional standard with white magnets saying: \u201cGood choice, shop healthy.\u201d Jetro has also cultivated its own network of farmers and suppliers to guarantee fresh products. \u201cWe want to support them,\u201d Mr. Sagen said of the bodegas. \u201cIn the long run, the more business they do, the more we do.\u201dMr. Ortiz, who owns Mango Grocery and Meat Market, took over the family bodega in 2006 after his father, Quirico, moved to the Dominican Republic to become a farmer. As the oldest of four children, Mr. Ortiz, 32, recalled growing up in the aisles of Jetro; his younger brother, Davis, later went to work for Jetro as a retail consultant.Mr. Ortiz shopped off a list of more than four dozen items scrawled on a Little Debbie carton top. He comes every Monday or Tuesday to stock up on fresh fruits and vegetables, and returns on Thursdays for nonperishables and again on Fridays for whatever is left on his list. He has even dashed over on Sundays to pick up more plantains for his Dominican customers.\u201cI come here and I don\u2019t have to go nowhere else,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Reserve Sees Slower Growth, but Maintains Plans to Trim Stimulus", "Date": "2014-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday sharply cut its economic forecast for 2014 even as it said the economy had bounced back after a nasty winter, allowing the central bank, in its view, to continue to retreat from its stimulus campaign.A m\u00e9lange of policy documents and public remarks by the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, carried the message that the Fed expected the recovery to maintain its slow and steady pace, and affirmed that the Fed intended an equally slow and steady retreat from its supporting role.The Fed announced, as expected, that it would cut monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in July, to $35 billion, and that it still planned to end purchases this fall. It also affirmed that it is likely to start raising its benchmark interest rate next year.\u201cGrowth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months,\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. It said labor markets, household spending and business investment were all improving.There are \u201cmany good reasons\u201d to expect faster growth going forward, Ms. Yellen said at a news conference after the statement was released. But she tempered that optimism by noting that Fed officials expect that damage from the recession will continue to weigh on the pace of recovery.Ms. Yellen said she was particularly concerned that some people who had been unable to find work would be permanently excluded from the job market.\u201cIt is conceivable that there is some permanent damage to them, to their own well-being, to their families\u2019 well-being and to the economy\u2019s potential,\u201d Ms. Yellen said, echoing a concern increasingly prevalent among economic policy makers.At the same time, Ms. Yellen sought to emphasize that the Fed regarded its forecasts as uncertain and its plans as malleable. Officials are concerned investors have grown too complacent about the trajectory of monetary policy and the economy.David Wessel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted that Ms. Yellen \u201clooked for ways to feather the word \u2018uncertainty\u2019 into almost every answer.\u201dThe Fed offered little information about the question most on the minds of investors: What comes next, after the central bank ends its bond-buying campaign later this year?The aggregated forecasts of Fed officials, published Wednesday, showed a small increase in the average expected level of the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate at the end of 2015 and 2016. The median for 2015 rose to 1.2 percent from 1.125 percent, but it was not clear that the change reflected a forward creep in the views of Fed officials about the timing of a first rate increase from the level close to zero at which the Fed has maintained the rate since late 2008. The change is slight, and the documents do not indicate whether it is Ms. Yellen and her allies who changed their views.Comparisons were also complicated by shifts in the committee\u2019s membership, as two members left and two new arrivals submitted forecasts for the first time.Twelve of the 16 participants said they expected a first rate increase in 2015. Investors generally share that expectation, but Ms. Yellen, who appeared to affirm that timing at her last news conference, avoided a repeat on Wednesday. Asked about the meaning of the Fed\u2019s statement that it would raise interest rates \u201ca considerable time\u201d after it stops buying bonds, she said the timing depended on the path the economy follows in the months ahead. \u201cWhile the Fed chair has tried to downplay those projections, they are consistent with Fed officials generally becoming at least a bit less dovish as unemployment continues to decline,\u201d Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients.Other analysts saw less meaning in the movement, however, and markets continue to price in a somewhat later and slower increase in rates.\u201cThe dots are likely biased upward by the more \u2018hawkish\u2019 members of the F.O.M.C., with the consensus likely more dovish,\u201d Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Bank Group, wrote in a note to clients.The Fed was more forthcoming about its economic views. Officials estimated that the economy would expand 2.1 percent to 2.3 percent this year, down from a March forecast for growth of 2.8 percent to 3.0 percent. It is the seventh straight year that the optimism of the Fed\u2019s initial forecasts has been gradually eroded by disappointing data. They also estimated that the economy in the long term would grow at a rate of 2.1 percent to 2.3 percent, markedly below their expectations just a few years ago. They continued to predict, however, that growth in 2015 and 2016 would exceed that average, topping 3 percent for the first time since the recession.Most Fed officials remained sanguine about inflation, making only small changes to their predictions that inflation will remain at or below 2 percent through 2016. Ms. Yellen also said concerns about financial stability were not playing a major role in the timing of the retreat. \u201cI don\u2019t see the kinds of broad trends that would suggest to me that the level of financial stability risks has risen above a moderate level,\u201d she said. Some economists share the Fed\u2019s guarded optimism. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said he saw signs of gathering momentum, including increased lending by banks and borrowing by consumers.\u201cThe real stimulus comes when the free market starts to stimulate, and that is happening now,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. He worries, however, that the Fed is underestimating the potential for faster inflation, a concern also shared by some Fed officials, who have continued to press for the Fed to accelerate the pacing of its retreat.The Fed\u2019s board held an unannounced meeting Tuesday, before the full policy-making committee convened, to discuss \u201cmedium-term monetary policy issues.\u201d The board, which comprises the governors based in Washington, but not the presidents of the regional reserve banks, held a similar meeting in April. The meetings are a reflection of Ms. Yellen\u2019s deliberative leadership style, the complexity of the internal debate \u2014 and perhaps the need to bring new officials up to speed.The policy-making committee has added three new voters since its last meeting in April. The Senate confirmed Stanley Fischer as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman and Lael Brainard as a new member of the board; Both were sworn into office on Monday. Loretta J. Mester, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, also attended her first meeting and exercised the vote Cleveland holds this year. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Drive Against Militants, Pakistani Airstrikes Hit Strongholds", "Date": "2014-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 As a full Pakistani military offensive in the tribal district of North Waziristan took shape on Monday, commanders promised a crushing blow to the jihadi groups that have flourished there in the past decade, spreading chaos in the region and posing a security threat to the West.Tanks rolled through the streets of Miram Shah, the district\u2019s main town, as jet fighters pounded targets in a nearby valley and tens of thousands of residents fled to safer areas out of fear of an impending ground assault.But the looming battle will also be decided, experts and analysts said, in Pakistan\u2019s major towns and cities, where the Taliban have threatened to exact violent retribution through mass mayhem. \u201cBy God, we will soon shake your palaces in Islamabad and Lahore and burn those to ashes,\u201d the Taliban spokesman, Shahidullah Shahid, said in a statement on Monday.The scale and virulence of any Taliban reprisals will offer a measure of how deeply the Islamist insurgents have penetrated mainstream society, experts say.Militant threats to bomb foreign airlines and business interests could further damage an economy that has already been crippled by years of violent\u00a0upheaval. And a rash of attacks would test the ability of the country\u2019s feeble security forces to confront and defeat them \u2014 especially as ambiguities persist inside the military toward certain multinational networks.\u201cEstablishing control in North Waziristan won\u2019t be the biggest issue,\u201d said Ayaz Amir, a former member of Parliament and a commentator. \u201cThe problem will lie in the militants\u2019 pockets of support across the country.\u201dThe jittery atmosphere was evident on Monday as soldiers patrolled the streets of Islamabad, and counterterrorism officials across the country arrested militant suspects as part of an effort to discover militant sleeper cells and pre-empt suicide bombings. But the main focus was North Waziristan, where the military operation entered its second day. American-made F-16 jets struck targets in the Shawal Valley, a thickly forested highland area and notorious militant hide-out, the military said. An intelligence official in Peshawar said one of those strikes had hit an abandoned school and killed 13 people, six of whom were members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a jihadist group with Taliban ties that played a central role in an audacious assault on the Karachi airport a week ago. Hours later, a Taliban roadside bomb ripped through a military convoy north of Miram Shah, killing at least six soldiers.Although the initial military drive is being led from the air, a ground operation looks likely. A military official in Peshawar said that about 2,300 soldiers had been moved into North Waziristan on Sunday, bringing the total strength there to about 20,000 soldiers, including paramilitary forces.Still, the exact situation was unclear. The military has tightly controlled the flow of information from the battle zone, which has been sealed off since Sunday and is out of bounds to most journalists. More difficult to control, though, is the situation in the major cities, where the Taliban and allied militants have a history of killing and kidnapping civilians, sabotaging the economy and outgunning the regular security forces. One major concern is an explosion of jihadi unrest in Punjab Province, where militant madrassas have quietly proliferated in recent years.Unidentified gunmen on Monday abducted a nephew of the country\u2019s chief justice in Multan, a city in southern Punjab, police officials and family members said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but immediate suspicions fell on militants operating in the area. One of the victim\u2019s relatives, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the missing man worked as a junior official at Inter-Services Intelligence, the military\u2019s powerful spy agency.The other major worry is Karachi, a city of 20 million people that has seen a gradual infiltration of Taliban fighters and sympathizers, many of whom have slipped into the city in the guise of refugees over the past five years.A senior counterterrorism officer in Karachi, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified a militant cell from the Mohmand tribal agency, near Peshawar, as the most dangerous Taliban group. \u201cThey could target governmental installation, foreign companies or prominent personalities,\u201d he said.In an effort to pre-empt possible Taliban reprisals, the Karachi police have raided suspected Taliban hide-outs in the city and detained a number of suspects since Sunday, the official said. Sharifuddin Memon, an adviser to the provincial home ministry, said that all new refugees would be registered as they entered Karachi and that no new refugee camps would be permitted on the edge of the city. Capability issues aside, one major problem for the security forces in frontally tackling Islamist violence is the military\u2019s continuing ambiguity toward some jihadi groups that are popularly known as the \u201cgood Taliban\u201d in Pakistan.For example, the North Waziristan offensive takes place in a district that is dominated by the Haqqani network, a fighting group that stages attacks in Afghanistan and has traditionally had close ties to Pakistani intelligence \u2014 one American general went as far as to call it a \u201cvirtual arm\u201d of the Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency.Until recently, Haqqani network operatives have mingled freely in North Waziristan alongside Pakistani Taliban fighters and the plethora of other militant outfits that shelter there. Pakistan\u2019s rejection of American demands for an operation in North Waziristan contributed to the escalation of the C.I.A. drone campaign, which has killed at least 2,300 people since 2008, according to groups that monitor the strikes.Major political figures have also voiced support for the military\u2019s move \u2014 including Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who until recently wanted to negotiate a peace deal with the Taliban, and his opposition rival, Imran Khan, a longtime critic of attacking the Taliban who nonetheless said on Monday that he was reluctantly supporting the operation.Away from the battle in Waziristan, analysts said, a crucial question now is the strength of the Taliban riposte, and whether it will sway public opinion. \u201cMost people think it\u2019s good that this operation has started,\u201d said Mr. Amir, the commentator. \u201cBut can we complement it with a broader antiterrorism policy across the country? That is the challenge for Pakistan.\u201dReporting was contributed by Zia ur-Rehman and Saba Imtiaz from Karachi, Pakistan; Ismail Khan and Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud from Peshawar, Pakistan; and Salman Masood from Islamabad, Pakistan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kenya\u2019s Future Clouds as Tensions Rise and Tourists Flee", "Date": "2014-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 The line at the water tank in the Kibera slum is not as long as it used to be. It\u2019s not because of a sudden advent of indoor plumbing. It\u2019s because fewer people can afford a 10-cent jerrycan of water.The cost of just about everything here is going up: rice, wood, rent, gas, minibuses. Hundreds of thousands of young men remain jobless, marooned in the muddy slums, selling garbage or hunting for casual work. And their ranks are growing only because a pillar of Kenya\u2019s economy \u2014 tourism \u2014 has been walloped by a wave of terrorist attacks, including a brazen raid on a coastal village last week that killed more than 40 people.Adding to the woes are rising political tensions, with critics accusing the government of trying to snuff out dissent and Kenya\u2019s opposition leaders threatening to stage nationwide protests.\u201cI\u2019m not talking small protests,\u201d Raila Odinga, an opposition leader, said, his eyes glowing. \u201cI\u2019m talking massive.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Odinga held a rally in a stadium in the western town of Eldoret, where thousands of young men pumped their fists and some called for the end of the current government. Kenya\u2019s police chief initially banned the rally, saying violence could break out, but police officials relented after they were accused of abusing their powers. Scores of riot officers, in helmets and camouflage fatigues, ringed the stadium.But even as anxiety, fear, malaise and pessimism are spreading here, and many speak of a dark cloud settling over Kenya, the outside world still sees mostly clear skies.Glass towers are rising across the capital, Nairobi, many financed by investors in Europe and the Middle East, and chugging bulldozers have become nearly as commonplace as minibuses. There are new roads everywhere, new bridges and huge malls being dug out of hillsides.Just this month, Kenya issued Africa\u2019s biggest debut Eurobond for an impressive $2 billion, and the deal was so oversubscribed \u2014 Morgan Stanley was among the investors \u2014 that the cost of the loan was substantially lower than expected.But at 51 years old, Kenya, which just celebrated its anniversary of independence from Britain, is a bit like a classic car: beautiful on the outside and nice to look at. But under the hood, many Kenyans say, the wiring, and especially the steering, need serious work.One reason for the market\u2019s confidence is Kenya\u2019s diversified economy. This is not a commodity country, like Nigeria or Ghana with their oil, or Zambia with its mountains of metal. There are agriculture, horticulture, tourism (usually), new discoveries of oil and gas, an expanding service sector, a far-reaching national airline and a major African port, with a second one under construction. Kenya\u2019s ruling party prides itself on its commitment to infrastructure.While the terrorist attacks are troubling, investors say, Kenya\u2019s track record of business development, and the size of its middle class, indicate years of growth.The biggest concern remains governance. And it is not only the recent moves by President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s administration to solidify control, threatening to pass a punitive news media bill and to start a nationwide neighborhood watch program that critics say is tantamount to an internal spy network. It is Kenya\u2019s entire system, which can best be described as an ethnocracy; it is a democracy, but politics are determined almost exclusively along ethnic lines and are often highly polarizing.People vote for members of their own group, however sullied the politicians\u2019 reputations are, and coalitions among the five or so major ethnic groups are held together, somewhat tenuously, by doling out posts, often to people grossly unqualified.He waved his hand dismissively.\u201cTribal arithmetic.\u201dIn the attack last week, two truckloads of militants roared into the coastal village with black flags, black scarves, AK-47s, bazookas, grenades and illumination flares. They shot dozens of people, slit throats, then burned down a good chunk of the town. It seemed more akin to an insurgency. Though the Shabab militant group from Somalia claimed responsibility, Mr. Kenyatta blamed \u201clocal political networks.\u201d On Wednesday, his police services arrested the governor of that area in connection with murder.All of this raises the question of how much more a business community, however talented, can accomplish in a place that is increasingly insecure. African terrorist groups seem to have suddenly realized how vulnerable many states are at their core. Nigeria is a cautionary tale. It boasts one of the fastest-growing economies on the continent, but at the same time, Boko Haram, a Nigerian militant group, is growing even faster. Nearly every week it stages bold attacks, including the kidnapping of more than 200 girls, still missing. But Nigeria produces nearly two million barrels of crude oil per day. It does not live or die on outside investment.Mr. Odinga, the opposition leader who lost in Kenya\u2019s last presidential election, remains the most potent shaper of the rising discontent. He holds no official government position, he is dismissed by many as having no clear plan, and he is 69. Still, he can instantly stir up the passions and loyalty of millions of fellow Luos, among others.In a recent interview at a hotel cafe, while slurping the froth off a cappuccino and snacking on peanuts, he said the people were fed up \u2014 so much so that they were \u201cwilling to take the bullet.\u201dAnd you? he was asked.Mr. Odinga tossed a few more peanuts into his mouth, paused, chewed and then grunted yes.Kibera slum is his base. People there barely get by. Boys wheel battered carts up sloppy paths, and women fry sardines in a drop of oil in gummy, tarred skillets. Not far from the water tank sat Peter Mutunga, vendor of secondhand pipe fittings. He had carefully laid out his wares on a plastic tarp, but nobody was buying.

It plans to end the expansion by the end of the year.At the same time, however, the Fed reinvests billions of dollars from maturing securities \u2014 about $16 billion each month this year \u2014 to maintain the size of its holdings.The Fed once planned to stop reinvesting, allowing its holdings to dwindle, soon after it ended the expansion of the portfolio. In 2011, the Fed said this would be its first signal that it was winding down the stimulus campaign. But there is growing support among Fed officials to preserve the portfolio\u2019s size instead.Continuing to reinvest could also help to keep borrowing costs low.Fed officials generally argue that the effect of bond buying on the economy is determined by the Fed\u2019s total holdings, not its monthly purchases. In this view, reinvestment would preserve the effect of the stimulus campaign. In either case, the benefits would be relatively modest in the short term, because the volume of reinvestment is likely to reach a low point in the next year, even as the Fed\u2019s holdings \u2014 now more than $4 trillion \u2014 remain at a historic high.The Fed in recent years has almost completely replaced its inventory of short-term government debt with longer-term securities that do not begin to mature until 2016. It has reinvested just $332 million in Treasuries so far this year, and would need to reinvest just $4 billion in 2015, according to calculations by Lou Crandall, chief economist for Wrightson ICAP, a financial research firm in New Jersey.Reinvestment of mortgage bonds is also in decline. The Fed received and reinvested about $24 billion a month as borrowers refinanced loans or sold homes in 2013. But as interest rates have ticked upward, prepayments have declined. Reinvestment averaged $16 billion a month during the first six months of 2014, and Mr. Crandall estimates that the volume will stabilize a little below that level next year. \u201cThe numbers are not zero, and it\u2019s still important because they\u2019re very mindful of the signaling effect of their operations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for 2015, it\u2019s largely symbolic.\u201dThat would change, however, in early 2016. Mr. Crandall calculates that $39 billion in Treasuries will mature in February that year, and about $177 billion during the rest of the year. Reinvesting those amounts would have a significant effect, he said.Among Fed officials, the debate over reinvestment has become a proxy for the broader debate about how quickly the Fed should end its stimulus campaign. The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her allies, including Mr. Dudley, see clear evidence that low borrowing costs can still help to improve the pace of growth, and they have sought to extend the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign accordingly.Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a strong proponent of the stimulus, suggested this month that the Fed could taper its reinvestments just as it has gradually slowed the expansion of its portfolio.Officials also have come to accept the bond holdings as a fact of life. In 2011, when the Fed first described its exit plans \u2014 which at the time it expected to enact much more quickly \u2014 officials believed that reducing the Fed\u2019s bond holdings was a necessary step to maintain control of inflation. They now insist other tools will serve the purpose, and that the size of the balance sheet doesn\u2019t really matter.John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said at a news conference last month that the reinvestment issue was simply \u201cnot that important\u201d and that changing the policy would just create a distraction.\u201cMy view is that we want to keep the communication as clear as possible,\u201d he said.Indeed, some officials argue that raising short-term interest rates may be a more important measure to prepare for future downturns than reducing the Fed\u2019s bond holdings.Already, the current recovery has run longer than the average period of growth between recessions since the Great Depression. And with short-term rates near zero, the Fed has little ability to respond if the economy falters.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil on Edge as World Cup Exposes Rifts", "Date": "2014-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is the strangest atmosphere I\u2019ve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,\u201d said Antonio Ris\u00e9rio, a historian who explores soccer\u2019s role in shaping Brazil\u2019s national identity.\u201cThe closer we get to the Cup, the more Brazil is going to show its passion for soccer,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said.But signs of such enthusiasm still remain somewhat sparse. And with political analysts arguing over how the Cup\u2019s outcome may influence this year\u2019s presidential election, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government is clearly hoping for a strong showing by Brazil\u2019s national team in a tournament unmarred by major problems.The sense of malaise is partly about the preparations for the World Cup itself, but also reflects a deeper, underlying anxiety about the direction of the country as the economic slump has persisted amid waves of antigovernment protests, reflecting demands from the growing middle class for better services. The divisions are manifesting themselves in unlikely ways; even as many Brazilians voice support for a soccer team that has long been the nation\u2019s passion and pride, others are expressing unhappiness with the sport being placed above other priorities.Before a warm-up match last Friday between Brazil and Serbia, the subway strike in S\u00e3o Paulo affected millions of commuters. Raising the fear of more unrest, police officers dispersed the strikers by beating them with batons in scenes recorded on smartphones and spread on social media.The game disappointed, too. Brazilian fans at the stadium even booed Neymar, the 22-year-old star of Brazil\u2019s national team, which limped to a 1-0 victory.\u201cThat talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality, no one swallows that anymore,\u201d said Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist for the newspaper O Globo.Despite the tension surrounding the Cup, many Brazilians point out that the country has a tradition of warmly receiving foreign visitors and pulling together at the last minute complex events like the Pan-American Games in 2007 or last year\u2019s World Youth Day, an international conference of Catholic youths which featured a visit by Pope Francis.If Brazil starts winning, some contend that optimism will surge around the first World Cup in the country since 1950, and easily exceed the low expectations. \u201cPeople are worried about how much has been spent,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Evaraldo Bezerra, 48, a doorman at a residential building in Bras\u00edlia. \u201cBut once we see the first game, the parties will start.\u201dTo the relief of authorities who contend Brazil will put on a great show despite some airports and transit systems not being completed, the streets in some areas in Brazilian cities are finally becoming festooned with yellow and green ribbons, the colors of the national team.Even so, many Brazilians say the decorations are less extensive than in the run-ups to other World Cups. In Jardins, an upscale S\u00e3o Paulo district, many store owners opted against such adornments out of fear that their premises would be targeted for damage by anti-World Cup protesters, said Rosangela Lyra, president of the area\u2019s commercial association.The massive street demonstrations against government corruption and World Cup spending that shook Brazilian cities last June have evolved into smaller protests, often led by fringe groups.Still, ire remains widespread over the estimated $11 billion cost of hosting the tournament, including subsidized loans for stadiums in cities like Bras\u00edlia, the capital; Cuiab\u00e1, a remote agribusiness center; and Manaus, an industrial hub deep in the Amazon, with paltry soccer fan bases.More than 100,000 people celebrated in Manaus when it was chosen as a host city, but that sentiment has shifted. \u201cWhy does a city like Manaus need an expensive and luxurious stadium when a few meters away there\u2019s a neighborhood, Alvorada, without sidewalks and treated sewage?\u201d asked Milton Hatoum, a writer from Manaus.The animus over the Cup is compounded by dismay at the delays and rising costs of the 2016 Summer Olympics, which Rio will also host. Mexico was the last country in Latin America to host these events in succession, holding the Olympics in 1968 and the World Cup in 1970, when its government tried to project its standing as a rising power in the developing world.\u201cThe diffuse messages which came together are that Brazilians want public services as good as the stadiums FIFA got for the World Cup,\u201d said Jerry D\u00e1vila, a professor of Brazilian history at the University of Illinois.While complaining about the quality of services in Brazil has grown into a pastime, the debate over hosting the Cup has also heightened sensitivity about how the country perceives itself and how it is perceived abroad.In what may prove to be one of the World Cup\u2019s legacies, and perhaps even a parable to other countries with ambitions of hosting the tournament, some in Brazil\u2019s thriving but imperfect democracy are questioning why the country sought such a massive undertaking when its institutions already had trouble delivering on more mundane matters.\u201cWe\u2019re the country of winging it, and that same characteristic which makes our soccer shine keeps us in an idyllic position in relation to any project,\u201d said Helio Gurovitz, editor of \u00c9poca, a weekly newsmagazine. \u201cWe plan poorly, monitor even worse, leave everything until the last hour and believe it will work out in the end,\u201d he added. \u201cUntil, one day, it doesn\u2019t.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about widespread dissatisfaction in Brazil over the costs of holding the World Cup and the Olympics erroneously attributed a distinction to Mexico for having also hosted both events in succession. Mexico was the last country in Latin America to do so, not the last country. (The United States was the last; it held the World Cup in 1994 and the Olympics in 1996.)Lucy Jordan contributed reporting from Bras\u00edlia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Urged to Multiply, Iranian Couples Are Dubious", "Date": "2014-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 In their early 30s, married, and with prospects for successful careers, Bita and Sherag could be contemplating the logical next step in their lives: becoming parents.But for them and an increasing number of young, middle-class Iranians who are deeply pessimistic over their country\u2019s future, raising a child is one of the last things on their minds.Bita, who like her husband asked for her family name to be withheld so they could speak freely, said she had had two abortions, which are illegal in Iran. \u201cWe are really serious about not having kids,\u201d she said.Iran\u2019s leaders have taken notice. Worried about a steep decline in fertility rates that experts are predicting could reduce population growth to zero within 20 years, Tehran has started a broad initiative to persuade Iranian families to have more children.Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sounded the alarm in a speech last winter, saying he was \u201cshaking with fear\u201d over the \u201cdangerous issue\u201d of population decline and warning officials to begin grappling with it now.\u201cAfter a few years, when the current young generation becomes old,\u201d he said, \u201cthere will be no cure for that.\u201dMr. Khamenei followed that up with a 14-point program, announced late last month, that health officials hope will lead to a doubling of Iran\u2019s population, to 150 million, by 2050. Hospital delivery stays are now free, and women are allowed longer maternity leave. Reversing past policies to control population growth, the government has canceled subsidies for condoms and birth control pills and eliminated free vasectomies.Billboards in the capital show a laughing father with five children riding a single tandem bicycle up a hill, leaving far behind an unhappy looking father with only one child. Those parents who actually produce five children are now eligible for a $1,500 bonus, not that many here are likely to be tempted.\u201cWhen I see those, I wonder, how can that father even smile?\u201d said Hadi Najafi, 25, an unemployed professional soccer player. He said he did not have the money to marry, let alone keep up with rents increasing by 25 percent a year.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.\u201cAnybody with a lot of children is either very rich or very irresponsible,\u201d Mr. Najafi said. \u201cThere is no other way.\u201dThe demographic problem has also become entwined with Iran\u2019s long-running conflict with the West over its nuclear program. One of the leading sources of Iran\u2019s economic troubles is the series of harsh Western economic sanctions imposed in recent years to punish Tehran and to bring it to the negotiating table.Iran\u2019s population policies have been erratic.At its peak, in the years after the 1979 revolution, Iran\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of children born to a woman during her childbearing years \u2014 was seven, according to experts, far above the replacement level of 2.1.Fearing that the country\u2019s economy would not be able to provide jobs for the growing number of young people \u2014 a situation with potentially explosive political repercussions \u2014 Iran\u2019s more moderate clerics introduced a \u201cfewer kids, better lives\u201d campaign to bring down the birthrate.Paradoxically, Iran has never had more people of reproductive age. A little under 70 percent of the population of 77 million is younger than 35, with most living in or near cities and increasingly embracing urban culture. But many of them are profoundly pessimistic.Like many young couples, Sherag, an architect, and Bita, a recent college graduate, cited a litany of problems as reasons for their dark outlook: an intrusive state and its conservative ideology, a sickly economy, political instability.\u201cWhen we go to bed we don\u2019t even know what will happen when we wake up,\u201d he said.\u201cI just don\u2019t want to bring children into this hell,\u201d she said.That attitude is widespread among Tehran\u2019s middle class. \u201cEven with our combined incomes, my husband and I can\u2019t afford to rent a place, so we alternate between our parents\u2019 houses,\u201d said Negar Mohammadi, the manager of one of Tehran\u2019s most popular restaurants. \u201cIf I were to give up my job to have kids, how would we manage to rent a house for ourselves?\u201dSome women and human rights activists suspect that the drive for more children is also aimed at keeping women in what conservative clerics believe is their place, the home.\u201cIt will make them more financially dependent on their husbands and the political system, prioritize the family\u2019s well-being over women\u2019s health and education and as a result of all these will make women\u2019s mobilization much more difficult,\u201d said Azadeh Kharazi, a sociologist.The new campaign has had at least one immediate impact, prompting a doctor formerly specializing in vasectomies to shift to Botox injections. For years, the doctor, Nasir Ahmadi, performed at least 60 vasectomies a month. Now, in a good month, he says, he does 10.\u201cWhen the state stopped paying, people stopped coming,\u201d he said.At a shrine near Dr. Ahmadi\u2019s clinic, the cleric in charge, Mojtaba Takhtipour, said economics should not be the deciding factor. Sitting behind a laptop, Mr. Takhtipour took a sip of hot tea and explained that Islam orders a quest for a perfect society.\u201cThat means we need to increase the number of Muslims, so we also need more kids,\u201d Mr. Takhtipour said. To those of his flock making financial arguments against having many children, he lectures on the scriptures of the faith. \u201cWe do believe that ultimately God will provide our daily bread. So go out and have kids and have faith, is what I always say.\u201dThere is a sectarian cast to the fertility issue as well.Although they dominate in Iran, Shiites are a minority worldwide, making up roughly 10 to 20 percent of all Muslims. Not only are the birthrates in Sunni-dominated countries much higher than those among Shiites, but so, too, are those of Sunni minorities living in Iran.Tahereh Labbaf, the medical adviser to the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution, which deals with the population issue, said that the birthrate for the country\u2019s Sunni Muslims is around four children per couple. \u201cThis is very sobering,\u201d a conservative website, Tasnim, quoted her as saying.Experts say that while birthrates in Iran are very low, there is no real crisis just yet. But they also say that financial incentives and faith will not by themselves reverse the population decline.The critical factor, said Mohammad Jalal Abbasi-Shavazi, head of the demographics department at Tehran University, is the economy.\u201cA young and unmarried boy or girl who does not have a permanent job and relies on one-month contracts cannot dare to marry or have children,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause in that case he endangers his job security and his or her own living condition.\u201dThe solution is simple and very complicated at the same time, he said. \u201cWe must try to create jobs, so people can feel secure and follow their plans.\u201dFor Mr. Najafi, the professional soccer player, words like \u201cfuture\u201d and \u201cplans\u201d make him queasy. \u201cWe are always told how there is a bright future ahead, but we are not allowed to live now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf only things were better in my lifetime, I would have a dozen children to share my happiness with.\u201dAn article on June 8 about concerns among Iran\u2019s leaders over a steep decline in fertility rates misidentified the measure of population growth that hit a peak after the 1979 revolution. It was the fertility rate, or the average number of children born to a woman during her childbearing years \u2014 not the birthrate, which is the number of births per 1,000 people. The article also misstated the fertility rate at that time. It was seven children per woman, not 3.6 children per couple. This article was corrected on The Times website in September after further reporting, but editors did not follow through with this correction for print editions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Democrats Set Off to Energize the Faithful, With a Focus on Women", "Date": "2014-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 It is a politically gloomy midterm election year for Democrats, but Representative Nancy Pelosi and some of her House colleagues were on a roll this week.With the Republican-controlled House in recess again, the women and an occasional male lawmaker took to the road in a bright purple bus, traveling from Seneca Falls, N.Y., the 19th-century birthplace of the women\u2019s rights movement, to Boston and Chicago. At each stop, they revved up small but enthusiastic crowds to turn out the vote, especially among single, working-class women, who are some of the Democrats\u2019 most reliable supporters but tend to skip voting in nonpresidential election years.\u201cWe need 17 votes, and then women can have it all!\u201d Ms. Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, told about 85 people who had hastily gathered at Ruby\u2019s Kitchen, a popular home-style restaurant in Toledo, Ohio, after the local Representative Marcy Kaptur pressed for an unplanned stop there on Tuesday. Democrats need to pick up 17 seats to gain control of the House.The crowd then joined Ms. Pelosi in a mantra: \u201cWhen women vote, women succeed, and when women succeed, America succeeds.\u201d\u201cWe need your votes,\u201d Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut said, to put Ms. Pelosi, the first woman to be speaker of the House, back in power.On Wednesday at the Teamster City building in Chicago, the local Representative Jan Schakowsky introduced Ms. Pelosi as \u201cthe former and future speaker,\u201d even as a man among the roughly 200 people in the audience yelled, \u201cNancy for president!\u201dOffstage, though, for all their field-trip bonhomie, the Democrats were hardly in denial about the odds against them.Midterm elections are typically perilous for the president\u2019s party, and President Obama\u2019s slumping popularity has handicappers predicting Republican gains in the House and perhaps a takeover of the Democratic-majority Senate.The road warriors\u2019 message, itinerary and audiences attested to the Democrats\u2019 plight: Their challenge is not so much to persuade people on the fence to vote Democratic as to mobilize the party faithful. They must reach out to supporters who are discouraged, disillusioned or simply distracted by the demands and economic insecurities of daily life \u2014 especially working women.Their message included an economic agenda drafted a year ago to appeal to women, calling for pay equity, a higher minimum wage, affordable child care and paid leave for workers with sick children. The bus traversed the Democratic states of New York, Massachusetts and Illinois, as well as the party\u2019s urban strongholds in the swing state of Ohio. Audiences largely came from local unions and party activists.\u201cIf you want to grow the U.S. economy, the best thing you can do is engage women in the economic growth of our country,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told some 150 people in Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday. To the significant minority of men in the audience, she added, \u201cThank you for being our partners.\u201d\u201cOur whole goal is: If people know about this, more people will vote,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said in an interview as the bus sped through Republican-leaning Indiana. \u201cIf more people are voting \u2014 particularly these women who need this the most, single moms \u2014 then Democrats and Republicans will pay more attention.\u201d \u201cWhatever happens to you in the election,\u201d she added, hinting at the challenge for Democrats in November, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to advance the cause. And that cause is for opportunity for women.\u201dThe partylike atmosphere belied the Democrats\u2019 political problems, as well as the bus\u2019s depressingly dark d\u00e9cor. (While its exterior was wrapped in the purple, gold and white colors of the women\u2019s suffrage movement \u2014 emblazoned with the words, \u201cWhen Women Succeed, America Succeeds: Women on a Roll\u201d \u2014 the interior was more masculine: browns and faux leather.)A refrigerator was stocked with water, sodas and ice cream, and Ms. Pelosi ate whole pints of chocolate ice cream, including for breakfast. There was no beer or wine, even when the women monitored several primary election returns on their laptops and cellphones past midnight on Tuesday en route to Chicago.Kicking off their heels, they swapped political war stories, like the time a generation ago when some female House members entered the Senate to protest its dismissive treatment of Anita Hill during hearings to confirm Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. A Republican senator, thinking they were staff, snapped at them to \u201cget against the wall.\u201dAbout two dozen Democrats participated in at least part of the four-day trip. Most \u2014 like the long-distance travelers Ms. Pelosi and Ms. DeLauro, and Representatives Donna Edwards of Maryland and Joyce Beatty of Ohio \u2014 were incumbents with safe seats. But they were joined at points by embattled representatives, like John F. Tierney of Massachusetts and Brad Schneider of Illinois, and challengers to incumbent Republicans, including Ann Callis in Illinois and Martha Robertson in New York.Michelle Obama also participated when the bus rolled into her party fund-raiser in Boston on Monday. \u201cWomen, minorities, young people \u2014 we don\u2019t show up in the midterms. And these are folks who agree with us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just need to get these folks out to vote.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stuyvesant Town, Former Middle-Class Bastion, Awaits Mayoral Help", "Date": "2014-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGothamTo discover a vaguely affordable apartment in Manhattan is like falling down a fire escape into a bed of clover.It speaks to luck nearly beyond words. So Kirstin Aadahl, a former schoolteacher and mother of a first-grader, describes what it was like to score a one-bedroom apartment in Stuyvesant Town. \u201cIt was like hitting the middle-class lottery,\u201d said Ms. Aadahl, an exuberant woman who sat in one of the development\u2019s interior courtyards and talked while her daughter played tag. All around, grand oak trees swayed like stalks in a stiff late-afternoon breeze. \u201cWe found a village in Manhattan,\u201d she said. \u201cWe love it. We are so, so vested in this community.\u201dThe problem with middle-class life in 21st-century Manhattan is that the vesting is so rarely reciprocal. Money flows like a flood-swollen river down avenues and side streets, and rents triple, quadruple, quintuple. The ecosystem that sustained New York City for centuries, great wealth alongside modest means, withers.For years, tenants in the 11,200 apartments in Stuyvesant Town and its cousin, Peter Cooper Village, which run east of First Avenue and just north of the East Village, sat preserved behind a dam of rent regulations. The red brick apartment buildings are cookie-cutter but the code was gentlemanly. Rents were restricted, behavior codes primly middle-class, and if your oven failed to fire on Thanksgiving, the landlord delivered a free turkey. Schoolteachers, character actors, firefighters and civil servants moved in, and sometimes their children gave doe eyes and flirted and fell in love and married and moved in downstairs from their parents.That reverie is over. The Upper West Side, Clinton, Chelsea, the Village, Murray Hill: One middle-class bulwark after another collapsed in the past three decades. Last decade, Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper became a multiple-billion-dollar exercise in leveraged excess. Tishman Speyer Properties and Black Rock paid $5.4 billion for the developments, a deal whose dollar figures penciled out only if its residents more or less disappeared.The city\u2019s leaders went tone deaf. Asked how to preserve this middle-class bastion, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg offered a plutocrat\u2019s appraising eye. \u201cYou always feel sorry for those who can\u2019t afford it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those who can afford it say, \u2018Well, what about me?\u2019\u00a0\u201dThat global economy and its I-got-mine-Jack ethos collapsed in a superheated heap. Tenants found a strange sort of afterlife. Predatory hedge funds still circled and the financier managers put in charge of the developments pulled out every trick imaginable to push rents higher. About half the units now are too expensive to qualify as middle class. Of late, the developments\u2019 receiver, CW Capital, and the hedge fund Fortress Capital \u2014 a name out of Charles Dickens, that one \u2014 have rumbled that a sale could come soon.So the tenants confront a new vortex and seek a new champion. Mayor Bill de Blasio is eloquent on the need for affordable housing, and he hopes to build and preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing in the next decade. His top advisers have worked hard to fashion a solution for these middle-class developments. So far they claim more success than the facts support.The mayor, who loves to talk of his liberal principles and transcendent victories, has kept an unusual silence. Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen, in an interview, noted that while the administration strongly favored keeping part of these developments affordable, it is often wise to conduct such negotiations under the radar.That said, a mayor\u2019s nouns and verbs carry weight. \u201cLetting the market rule there was one of Bloomberg\u2019s very worst decisions,\u201d noted a member of one of New York\u2019s more prominent real estate duchies, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity for fear of displeasing the mayor. \u201cA mayor\u2019s voice matters in setting out the parameters.\u201dNor is the situation hopeless. The tenants and a real estate partner want to turn the buildings into condos, with a cap on resale values. Others talk of creating a nonprofit corporation to obtain and manage the still-affordable apartments.The city and the de Blasio administration have an oversupply of creative affordable-housing sorts. \u201cAll that\u2019s clear is an open auction would be disastrous,\u201d Councilman Daniel R. Garodnick noted.At stake is our once-glorious urban ecosystem. Too many global cities, from London to Paris to San Francisco, have turned gilded at their cores. Ms. Aadahl and her husband pay a slightly ridiculous rent for a one-bedroom. It\u2019s crowded, but so what? She accepts that. She just wants her mayor to toss down a marker for the real estate barons. \u201cYou know what I have to say to him?\u201d Hers eyes fix on yours. \u201cCome through.

Its reauthorization was once routine for Congress.Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia \u2014 who will step down as majority leader next month after losing his primary to a Tea Party-backed candidate \u2014 negotiated the three-year reauthorization with Representative Steny H.

{"Headline": "Taking Page From Health Care Act, Obama Climate Plan Relies on States", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s new plan to fight climate change depends heavily on states\u2019 devising individual approaches to meeting goals set in the nation\u2019s capital, a strategy similar to the one he used to expand health care, often with rocky results. Rather than imposing a uniform standard for reducing power plant carbon emissions, the regulation unveiled on Monday offers the states flexibility to pick from a menu of policy options. But as with health care, the policy could lead to a patchwork of rules that frustrate businesses and invite resistance from states that oppose the policy.Largely welcomed by environmentalists, the plan generated a torrent of criticism from industry, coal-state lawmakers from both parties and Republican leaders who called it a job-killer that would raise utility costs. The proposal is chiefly aimed at cutting pollution from coal-fired power plants, the nation\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. It assigns each state a separate pollution reduction target, but gives each wide leeway in tailoring its plan. The idea, Environmental Protection Agency officials said, is to allow states to design plans that best fit regional economies and mixes of energy sources.While Rust Belt states rely heavily on coal, farmers in Iowa and Minnesota generate up to 20 percent of their power from renewable sources, and Southeastern states like North Carolina depend on nuclear power. California and nine Northeastern states have enacted cap-and-trade programs, putting a cap on carbon pollution and creating markets to buy and sell pollution permits. Those programs have substantially lowered the states\u2019 carbon footprints. In order to comply with the new national rule, states can, among other actions, shut down coal plants, install wind and solar power and energy-efficiency technology, or join the California or Northeastern cap-and-trade programs. E.P.A. officials said states could even choose to comply by enacting a state-level tax on carbon pollution. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this, where states get this much flexibility. It\u2019s astounding,\u201d said Dallas Burtraw, an expert on electricity markets with Resources for the Future, a Washington research group. \u201cThe E.P.A. is signaling maximal deference to the states.\u201dIn introducing the regulation, Mr. Obama called it \u201ca sensible, state-based plan\u201d and dismissed the criticism.\u201cI promise you, you will hear from critics who say the same thing they always say \u2014 that these guidelines will kill jobs or crush the economy,\u201d he told environmental activists in a conference call organized by the American Lung Association. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen every time is these claims are debunked when you actually give workers and businesses the tools and incentives to innovate.\u201dCarbon emissions by country and a proposal to significantly cut U.S. levels by 2030.The regulation, which must go through a public comment period before taking effect, will certainly be challenged in the courts and in Congress, but Mr. Obama has past judicial rulings to cite in his defense and enough votes on Capitol Hill that would allow him to veto any opposing legislation and make it stick.If the regulation survives the lobbyists and lawyers intact, the battles will move to state capitals as businesses, environmentalists and lawmakers joust in 50 separate arenas over the scope of the resulting rules.Just as some states balked at devising ways of carrying out Mr. Obama\u2019s health care program, forcing the federal government to step in in many cases, some governors are signaling that they will resist the new restrictions on power plants. Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a conservative Republican who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2016, said he would oppose the rule while finding \u201ccommon-sense solutions\u201d that protect workers and consumers. Indiana gets about 80 percent of its electricity from coal.\u201cThese proposed regulations will be devastating for Hoosier workers and families,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cThey will cost us in higher electricity rates, in lost jobs, and in lost business growth due to a lack of affordable, reliable electricity. Indiana will oppose these regulations using every means available.\u201dA number of states are expected to sue the E.P.A. over the rule. Many Republican governors, in particular, are ideologically opposed to the prospect of enacting cap-and-trade programs. And some may follow the path of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who in the past has signaled his state\u2019s opposition to E.P.A. pollution regulations by simply refusing to submit compliance plans.That could set up a standoff in which the E.P.A. would step in and force states to comply with a plan devised by federal rather than state officials. White House officials recognized the possible challenges in a state-by-state plan, but said they had little choice given the language of the law on which the regulation is based, and they expressed optimism that industry would want an orderly process. \u201cWhile I am sure that there will be holdouts amongst the states, most utilities will also want to work with their regulators to ensure successful implementation,\u201d said John D. Podesta, Mr. Obama\u2019s counselor. By comparison, the plan calls on Washington State, which has just one coal-fired power plant, and relies on hydroelectric power, to cut its emissions rate 84 percent.Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, a liberal who, like Mr. Obama, hopes to make climate policy a signature of his tenure, cheered the rule. He said it would \u201cencourage and empower ongoing state and regional climate action, such as our collaborative efforts to grow the Pacific Coast\u2019s clean energy economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Republicans, he said, \u201cdon\u2019t do anything except block me and call me names.\u201dRepublicans want to bind Democrats ever more tightly to Mr. Obama, and to cast the blame on them for the slow pace of job growth.The Republican-controlled House \u201chas passed jobs bill after jobs bill, only to see them blocked by the president and other Washington Democrats,\u201d said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John A.

{"Headline": "Measuring Recovery? Count the Employed, Not the Unemployed", "Date": "2014-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Recovery in Need of a RecoverySouth Carolina\u2019s unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent in April, lower than in December 2007, when it stood at 5.5 percent on the eve of the Great Recession.The share of South Carolina adults with jobs, however, has barely rebounded.The reason is that the numbers are not quite two sides of a coin. The employment rate counts everyone with a job, while the unemployment rate counts only people actively seeking work. It excludes most people who are unemployed.After most recessions, the numbers have moved in sync as the share of the population neither working nor looking has remained fairly constant. But after this recession, the middle ground has ballooned as fewer people try to find jobs.It shows that the economy is improving. Employment rates have climbed above the post-recession nadir in every state, although the improvements are often quite small. In Mississippi, the employment rate is just 0.1 percent above its recent low.It also shows that the recovery has a long way to go. Employment rates have rebounded in some states with strong growth, like Utah, Nebraska and Montana. But only three states \u2014 Maine, Texas and Utah \u2014 have retraced more than half their losses.(Maine is a curiosity. Its economy has expanded less since 2009 than any state\u2019s except Connecticut. Conversely, North Dakota and South Dakota, two of the three states with the most growth over the same period, have seen little recovery in their employment rates \u2014 perhaps in part because their losses were relatively small.)The slow progress hints at a bleak reality. Most economists do not expect employment rates to rebound completely. A growing share of adults is too old to work, because baby boomers are aging into retirement while fewer immigrants are arriving to take their places in the work force. The share of workers claiming disability benefits, or retiring early, also increased sharply in recent years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Right", "Date": "2014-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConservatives generally believe that capitalism is a machine that cures itself. Therefore, people on the right have been slow to recognize the deep structural problems that are making life harder in the new economy \u2014 that are leading to stagnant social mobility, widening inequality and pervasive insecurity. In the first essay of the book, Peter Wehner moves beyond the ruinous Republican view that the country is divided between hearty entrepreneurs and parasitic \u201ctakers.\u201d Like most reform conservatives, he shifts attention sympathetically to the struggling working and middle classes. He grapples with the fact, uncomfortable for conservatives, that the odds of escaping poverty are about half as high in the United States as in more mobile countries like Denmark. Yuval Levin argues that conservatives have tacitly accepted the 20th-century welfare state; they just want less of it. To respond to the economy\u2019s structural woes, he continues, conservatives will have to change not only the size of the government but its nature.\u201cThe left\u2019s ideal approach,\u201d Levin writes, \u201cis to put enormous faith in the knowledge of experts in the center and empower them to address the problem.\u201d The right\u2019s ideal approach, he continues, \u201cis to put some modest faith in the knowledge of the people on the ground and empower them to try ways of addressing the problem incrementally.\u201dLiberals emphasize individuals and the state, Levin argues. Conservatives should funnel resources to nurture the civic institutions in between. They should set up decentralized initiatives that rely on local knowledge and allow for a more dynamic process of experimentation. The next 10 chapters contain a slew of proposals to decentralize the welfare state. Several writers support much larger family tax credits to empower families. James C. Capretta writes that households without access to employee health plans could be given a tax credit comparable in size to the tax subsidy given to families with these plans. Frederick M. Hess suggests that parents should be given, \u201ccourse choice,\u201d the chance to not only choose their children\u2019s school but to use a fraction of school funding to purchase access to specialized programs, in, say, math or science. Scott Winship mentions the universal credit, which consolidates a variety of antipoverty programs and distributes benefits to families as a single amount. Under these and other proposals, the government would address middle-class economic security by devolving power down to households and local governments. This is both to the left of the current Tea Party agenda (more public activism) and also to the right (more fundamental reform). The agenda is a great start but underestimates a few realities. First, the authors underestimate the consequences of declining social capital. Today, millions of Americans are behaving in ways that make no economic sense: dropping out of school, having children out of wedlock. They do so because the social guardrails that used to guide behavior have dissolved. Giving people in these circumstances tax credits is not going to lead to long-term thinking. Putting more risk into vulnerable people\u2019s lives may not make them happier.The nanny state may have drained civil society, but simply removing the nanny state will not restore it. There have to be programs that encourage local paternalism: early education programs with wraparound services to reinforce parenting skills, social entrepreneurship funds to reweave community, paternalistic welfare rules to encourage work. Second, conservatives should not be na\u00efve about sin. We are moving from a world dominated by big cross-class organizations, like public bureaucracies, corporations and unions, toward a world dominated by clusters of networked power. These clusters \u2014 Wall Street, Washington, big agriculture, big energy, big universities \u2014 are dominated by interlocking elites who create self-serving arrangements for themselves. Society is split between those bred into these networks and those who are not. Moreover, the U.S. economy is increasingly competing against autocratic economies, which play by their own self-serving rules. Sometimes government is going to have to be active to disrupt local oligarchies and global autocracies by fomenting creative destruction \u2014 by insisting on dynamic immigration policies, by pumping money into research, by creating urban environments that nurture innovation, by spending money to give those outside the clusters new paths to rise.I\u2019d say the reform conservatives are still a little too Jeffersonian. They have a bit too much faith in the magic of decentralization. Some decentralized reforms do nurture personal responsibility and community flourishing. But as Alexander Hamilton (and Margaret Thatcher) understood, sometimes decentralization needs to be complemented with energetic national policies, to disrupt local oligarchies, self-serving arrangements and gradual national decline.

{"Headline": "Diesels: Not Just for the Big Guys Anymore", "Date": "2014-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAround the BlockBy rolling out the market\u2019s only half-ton diesel pickup in a time of tightening fuel-economy standards, the Ram brand (formerly known as Dodge) gives its corporate parent, Fiat Chrysler, a chance to stand out from its competitors.But along with the attention comes criticism. Skeptics point out that the hefty costs of diesel \u2014 both the fuel and the engine option \u2014 may outweigh its mileage benefits.Indeed, the V6 engine, produced by a Fiat subsidiary, VM Motori, comes at a premium of $2,850 over a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 and fully $4,500 more than a base 3.6-liter V6. Add in the higher cost of diesel fuel \u2014 on average, 23 cents a gallon more than regular gasoline, the Energy Department says \u2014 as well as the requisite fill-ups of diesel exhaust fluid at about $22 worth every 10,000 miles, and it could take years before the efficiency of a compression-ignition engine starts to pay back.Shoppers should not overlook other benefits of a diesel engine, though: the potential to haul more, a longer service life and a higher value at trade-in time. The V6 turbodiesel offers a ho-hum 240 horsepower but makes up for it with 420 pound-feet of torque, on par with a gasoline V8 and enough to get the truck in front of a 9,200-pound trailer. Paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, the Ram runs through the gears with polished manners.A 2-wheel-drive Ram EcoDiesel carries an impressive fuel-economy rating of 28 m.p.g. on the highway, making that 3-liter V6 a worthy competitor to V8 impersonators like Ford\u2019s 3.5-liter V6 EcoBoost, rated at just 22 m.p.g. on highway. During a weeklong test drive, I got 20.5 m.p.g. in mostly stop-and-go traffic. The diesel V6\u2019s closest rival in terms of fuel economy is another Ram, the gasoline 3.6-liter V6, which has a highway rating of 25 m.p.g.The diesel\u2019s range also is impressive, with an estimated 728 miles between fill-ups. I liked that Ram included a gauge showing the level of diesel exhaust fluid; other brands do not provide much advance warning of the fluid running low.With all that diesel torque engaging the pavement, it\u2019s a blast to drive. Acceleration from a stoplight is a bit lazy at first but as the turbo spins up, a powerful jolt quickly follows. And it\u2019s well refined. With the windows rolled up, I could barely detect the diesel\u2019s typical clatter. Thanks to its emission controls, there was not a whiff of smoke visible from the tailpipe, either.Getting a grip around the steering wheel could be a challenge for smallish hands \u2014 it feels about as thick as a baseball bat \u2014 but the electric power steering is nicely tuned. I felt as if I were engaged with a machine; some systems feel more like a bowl of oatmeal spinning in your hands. Ram\u2019s UConnect touch screen boots up quickly and responds well to voice commands, something that can\u2019t be said for some other trucks.As much fun as driving the diesel Ram is, you\u2019re still left wondering if all this was worth the high price.The company is not worried about shoppers understanding the long-term value story. Ram predicts that the EcoDiesel will command 15 percent of its half-ton pickup sales in the next year.\u201cThey\u2019ve asked for a light-duty diesel for years,\u201d Bob Hegbloom, Ram\u2019s brand director, said of the truck\u2019s customers.Soon, the EcoDiesel will have company. Nissan is working with Cummins to build a 5-liter V8 option for its next-generation Titan pickup, while Chevrolet next year will introduce a Duramax 4-cylinder for its new Colorado midsize pickup. Other brands are rumored to be following suit.Advertisement"}

Council already approved the sales tax expansion in May as part of its budget, which passed by a vote of 11-2. Tuesday\u2019s vote would provide final approval to the budget.That might sound good, because it means we pay fewer taxes. Yet state sales tax collections have barely moved over the last few decades; they were 1.89 percent of personal income in 1980, and 1.83 percent in 2011. States have almost entirely offset the narrowing of the sales tax base by raising sales tax rates: The median state tax rate rose from 4 percent in 1980 to 6 percent in 2011.That would be a mistake, but it\u2019s one I expect the Council to make. Reforms that aim to expand sales tax bases are popular with tax policy experts, but they haven\u2019t fared well in state legislatures. Between 2008 and 2011, amid fiscal crisis, seven states considered proposals to overhaul their tax codes by expanding the sales tax: Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In every case, the proposal was defeated, repealed or watered down beyond recognition.In Maryland, a proposal to tax many services turned into a tax solely on computer services, which was later repealed after outcry from the industry. In Maine, a broad sales tax expansion to services (and an associated income tax cut) passed the legislature and was swiftly repealed by voter initiative with 61 percent of the vote. Massachusetts voters repealed their legislature\u2019s decision to expand the sales tax to alcoholic beverages.In all of these fights, the newly taxed industries became a powerful lobby against the new tax. Every industry has a story about why it should be exempt from sales tax; Washington\u2019s gyms, asking why you would tax a service that makes people healthier, are no exception.But when states and cities can\u2019t tax services, they simply resort to ever-higher taxes on goods. So if D.C. heeds the #donttaxfitness call, you can expect the Council to tax something else, instead.Advertisement"}

Banks have been able to issue equity on the markets. The unemployment rate has fallen for four months in a row, although it is still a terrible 27 percent. The economy has also either just stopped shrinking or will do so soon.Greece\u2019s top industry, tourism, is set to reach new highs this summer after setting records last year. Foreign investors are looking to take advantage of cheap labor, cheap real estate and a better investment climate. Only last week, the Chinese premier was in Greece, signing $4 billion of commercial deals and declaring that the country could become China\u2019s gateway to Europe.One might have thought Mr. Samaras would stick with the team that helped deliver this success. But the prime minister was scared after his center-right New Democracy party was beaten into second position in the European Parliament elections last month by Syriza, the radical left group, and so promoted some populist politicians.Yannis Stournaras, the former finance minister, was moved to the less critical but still important role of central bank governor. The economic development and health ministers were also demoted.The new finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, a respected economist, has attempted to reassure the euro zone governments, which are Greece\u2019s main creditors, that the country remains committed to its reform program. The head of the quasi-independent tax agency was forced to quit. This was because he had made a mistake in issuing a circular saying that holders of Greek bonds would face retrospective taxation, according to two officials. His replacement will be chosen by a committee that includes France\u2019s top tax official, so there is no risk of cronyism, they say.But Greece\u2019s euro zone partners and the International Monetary Fund are not convinced of this explanation. Given that one of Greece\u2019s deepest problems has been tax evasion, they want to make sure that politicians do not start meddling with the tax agency again.All of this is unfortunate, because Athens still needs its creditors\u2019 support to secure better terms on its debt load. The outlines of a deal have already been sketched: freezing the interest rate at below 1 percent; increasing the grace period before any of the debt needs to be repaid; and extending the period over which the borrowings are ultimately paid off by another decade or so.The snag is that Greece\u2019s creditors will not formally agree to this debt relief deal until they are satisfied that Athens is sticking to the agreed reform program, and the reshuffling has just raised questions about that. As a result, the I.M.F.\u2019s review of Greece\u2019s progress, which starts in the autumn, could drag on into next year.The government is concerned that it will not just have to convince its creditors that it is still on track with reforms but that it will have to wait until it is clear how much, if any, extra money it has to pump into its banks. Although there will be some visibility on this after the European Central Bank completes its stress tests on large banks in the euro zone in the autumn, the government worries that it will be forced to wait months after that to clarify whether the market will provide the funds.A few months\u2019 delay matters because a new Greek president has to be chosen by Parliament in the new year and unless 60 percent of the members of Parliament back the president, there has to be an early general election. It is touch and go whether Mr. Samaras can scrape together the necessary majority.As a result, the prime minister is worried that he will have to fight an election without a debt deal under his belt. That may be another reason he is flirting with populism. But this would not be a route to success. If the Greek people want populism, they will vote for the genuine article, Syriza, not a pale imitation. Mr. Samaras\u2019s best bet is to convince Greece\u2019s creditors that he is not wobbling on reform and that they should complete the debt deal by year-end. His single-minded aim should be to have a really good story about how reform pays off if he has to face the Greek people in the spring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cutting the Poor Out of Welfare", "Date": "2014-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past three decades, Congress has conducted a major experiment in anti-poverty policy. Legislators have restructured benefits and tax breaks intended for the poor so that they penalize unmarried, unemployed parents \u2014 the modern-day version of the \u201cundeserving poor.\u201d At the same time, working parents, the aged and the disabled are getting larger benefits.Legislative changes in three major programs have driven these shifts.\u201cThere has been a redistribution away from single parent families and to married parent families,\u201d Robert A. Moffitt, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, declared in May in his presidential address to the Population Association of America, the text of which he provided to The Times. In addition, Moffitt told the group, \u201cthere has been a redistribution from those at the bottom of the private income distribution to those above it, including those up to 200 percent of the poverty line, which has led to greater inequality of government support within the low income population.\u201dThese trends are documented in Figure 1.For the poorest of the poor, the results have been devastating: in 1983, 56 percent of total government transfers going to the poor and near-poor went to those on the bottom, those making 50 percent or less of the federal poverty level income. By 2004, that number had fallen to 32 percent, Moffitt found.Overall, according to Moffitt, federal spending on the poor has grown substantially since the mid-1980s, by 74 percent from 1975 to 2007, adjusted for inflation. But those on the lowest rungs of the ladder have seen their government benefits decline, again in inflation-adjusted terms.Moffitt noted in an email that \u201cthe work incentives in the government safety net have greatly increased over the last 20 years: less welfare payments if you don\u2019t work, and much greater government payments if you do.\u201dThese policy alterations have subsidized the earnings of millions of low-income workers, particularly of married couples with children, pushing them above the official poverty line. If, however, the question is how successful these changes have been in getting poor people into the work force, then the answer is not very.In an email to The Times, Mead described his basic premise: \u201cOverwhelmingly, American poverty is due to failure to work at all, not working at low wages. The working poor are vastly outnumbered by the nonworking. Nor is nonwork due to lack of jobs, since only 10.5 percent of nonworking poor adults blame inability to find a job for their joblessness.\u201dMead\u2019s views do not have widespread support among mainstream economists, including among some experts on the center-right.David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., concurred. In an email, he wrote that the decline over the past 35 years in \u201cthe employment/population rates of high-school graduates, and to a greater degree, high school dropout males,\u201d is due in large part \u201cto falling labor demand, falling job opportunities and falling real wages for low-skill males.\u201dAutor shares the concerns of conservatives over the \u201cdamage to family structure, educational investment, and health behaviors, and role modeling in poor inner cities.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cthe problem didn\u2019t start with culture, and cannot be fixed simply by fixing that culture, absent a substantial improvement to job opportunities for low-skill workers.\u201dThe use of disincentives in the form of reduced or abolished benefits to encourage work has inflicted hardship on some populations, according to Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University.There is extensive evidence showing that federal programs providing benefits to the poor do, in fact, substantially reduce poverty rates.In May 2013, H. Luke Shaefer, a professor of social work at the University of Michigan, and Kathryn Edin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins, published \u201cRising Extreme Poverty in the United States and the Response of Federal Means-Tested Transfer Programs.\u201dWomen and children in these circumstances are the casualties of the rightward shift in the war on poverty. They have no political clout to speak of. Most of those old enough to vote do not do so. And neither political party has reason to take up their cause.Anti-poverty policy, like all public policy set in the political arena, is determined more by the balance of power than by evidence-based analysis or by humanitarian concerns. There is no other way to explain how one of the most advanced countries in the world sits passively by as legions of men without high school degrees disappear from the work force, or to explain how our country permits 1.17 million children to survive on $2 or less a day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dubai, Once a Humble Refueling Stop, Is Crossroad to the Globe", "Date": "2014-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The gimmicks to attract attention and passengers \u2014 a $1 million raffle, a chance to win a Porsche 911, or a monthlong shopping festival \u2014 are still there but are hardly needed anymore. Travelers from around the world no longer need to be lured to this parched former trading post on the edge of the Persian Gulf.From its humble beginning as a refueling stop for travelers with no desire to linger in an inhospitable corner of the Arabian Peninsula, Dubai\u2019s airport has recently overtaken Heathrow Airport in London as the world\u2019s busiest international air travel hub. Just a decade ago, Dubai ranked as the 45th-largest international hub.Dubai\u2019s rise as a modern crossroads connecting East and West \u2014 with the name of its hometown airline, Emirates, adorning the jerseys of the world\u2019s best soccer teams and sponsoring Formula One car racing and the United States Open \u2014 is a tale of globalization and ambition, and an audacious bet on the future of air travel.Now, families from India and European backpackers roam through the airport\u2019s soaring terminals, with water cascades and fake palm trees, duty-free stores and high-end boutiques, as athletes from Iran and tourists from Russia look for their next flight in this cosmopolitan oasis.With few natural resources, barely any oil of its own, only 168,000 Emiratis and average temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit from May to September, Dubai has taken on a hazardous gambit.But what Dubai lacked in climate it more than made up in geography. Situated within eight flying hours of two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, Dubai has set up a global hub that can connect virtually any two cities in the world with just one stop. And despite the last economic downturn, it has stuck with grand plans to build a second airport that will eventually dwarf its existing one in the next decade.But the cornerstone of the strategy was creating a new airline and building an aviation infrastructure around it to support its growth.Runway repairs have temporarily slowed traffic at Dubai\u2019s airport, but it should cement its lead over Heathrow by next year.Emirates was set up in 1985 with a $10 million grant from the government of Dubai and a pair of Boeing 727 planes. The catalyst was a decision by Gulf Air, the region\u2019s main carrier at the time, to cut back on weekly flights between the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan because of a dispute over traffic rights.The carrier grew rapidly thanks to open skies policies that favored the development of the aviation sector and a business-friendly environment for foreigners.It helped too that the chairman and chief executive of Emirates, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, is also chairman of Dubai Airports, president of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, and chairman of Flydubai, a low-cost carrier. He is also the uncle of the current ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.To attract tourists, Dubai created a monthlong shopping festival offering discounts and deals on global brands and cheaper fares and hotel rooms.A report by the CAPA Center for Aviation, a consulting firm, said Dubai\u2019s growth was \u201cinexorable,\u201d thanks to its aggressive airline expansion, few restrictions on international flights and large public investments.\u201cDubai lies at the heart of a global travel nexus, linking Asia-Pacific to Europe and Africa,\u201d CAPA said.Five years ago, the global credit crisis brought Dubai near bankruptcy. But the city has recovered its drive, helped partly by a $10 billion bailout from neighboring Abu Dhabi, and a return of investors from the Middle East and Eastern Europe.Its capacity could reach 200 million by the middle of the century, said Paul Griffiths, the chief executive of the government-owned Dubai Airports.\u201cWe keep recasting our capacity goals because the demand we are forecasting keeps going up,\u201d he said. Dubai\u2019s success has rattled its rivals, particularly airlines in Europe and the United States, which have complained that traffic was being siphoned from their hubs. They are also concerned by a recent decision from the United States to set up an immigration clearance facility in Dubai similar to the one in Abu Dhabi, which allows passengers traveling to the United States to clear immigration before boarding.After Dubai won the bid to host the World Expo in 2020, fueling another round of frenzied construction, some have expressed concern. The International Monetary Fund warned about the risk of a new real estate bubble and the extra financial risk that would pose to government entities.Emirates has also spawned a pair of rivals in the Gulf region, Etihad Airways in neighboring Abu Dhabi and Qatar Airways, which have mimicked its strategy and threaten to take away some of its traffic.Still, tourists are back. At 2 a.m. on a Friday, for instance, the airport is teeming with travelers.\u201cIt\u2019s a little shiny, and a little flashy, and it\u2019s definitely Dubai-style but I like it,\u201d said Marius Verscheure, a French petroleum engineer, who was recently waiting for a flight on a two-hour layover between Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s big but you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed by the size.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Thaw With Iran, Coming at a Crucial Juncture, Could Be Useful to Allies", "Date": "2014-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 With the election of a relatively moderate president in Iran and the rise of radical Sunni fighters in Syria and Iraq, Britain is pressing ahead to improve relations with Iran and reopen its embassy in Tehran.While Britain appears to be moving much more quickly to restore ties with Iran than the United States is, the history of relations is different. The decision to reopen the British Embassy is the culmination of a gradual effort to improve ties with Iran since the election of President Hassan Rouhani a year ago and a new Iranian seriousness about negotiating on the country\u2019s contentious nuclear program.\u201cIt\u2019s very much in Britain\u2019s interest to have a presence in Iran,\u201d said Ellie Geranmayeh, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations here. \u201cThe Iran desk can\u2019t really do its job properly without people on the ground and contacts with Iranian counterparts.\u201dWith the chaos in Syria and now Iraq, Ms. Geranmayeh said, \u201cevents are demonstrating that we can\u2019t keep ignoring Iran in this picture,\u201d and in some ways, she added, \u201cIran seems less of a security threat to Britain, given the Rouhani factor, than Iraq and Syria.\u201dPrime Minister David Cameron said Tuesday that he supported improved ties with Iran in any case, but \u201cwhat is happening in Iraq is not a reason for not taking that step.\u201d He said that foreigners fighting with the radical Sunni group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, known as ISIS, represented \u201ca real threat\u201d to Britain.\u201cNo one should be in any doubt that what we see in Syria and now in Iraq in terms of ISIS is the most serious threat to Britain\u2019s security that there is today,\u201d Mr. Cameron said.Britain suspended full diplomatic relations with Iran on security, not policy grounds, after the British Embassy was stormed by angry Iranians in November 2011. But Britain did not break ties and has had senior diplomats based in London working with the Iranians. Last October, the two countries each named a nonresident charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires to work toward improving relations and reopening their respective embassies, with a modest staff to start.The major players in the Iraq and Syria crisis are often both allies and antagonists, working together on one front on one day and at cross-purposes the next.While British relations with the Islamic Republic have gone up and down many times since the 1979 revolution, they were normalized in 1998 and have only been suspended at different times since then.The United States, by contrast, has not had a working embassy in Tehran since the immediate aftermath of the revolution, when students and others seized the embassy as a \u201cnest of spies\u201d in November 1979 and held Americans hostage for 444 days. The Iranians said they were responding to the decision by the United States, \u201cthe Great Satan,\u201d to give asylum to the deposed shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, when he sought medical treatment for the cancer.Washington broke diplomatic ties with Iran in April 1980. The Swiss government has since represented American interests in Tehran, and Pakistan has represented Iran in Washington.While the British Embassy opening will be modest, having a trusted ally back on the ground in Iran to report and gather intelligence will probably benefit the United States and Israel, too, Ms. Geranmayeh said. \u201cIt is also an opportunity for Iran to restore its reputation and say that we\u2019re not only serious on the nuclear issue, but that we want to engage on global issues and the economy,\u201d she said.It also shows Iranians, especially those who support Mr. Rouhani, that there is reciprocity in the West for his effort to reach out and repair ties after years of confrontation under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\u201cThere is a colonial hangover,\u201d Ms. Geranmayeh said. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly getting over the \u2018Uncle Napoleon\u2019 syndrome for both sides. But it will take a lot longer with the United States than with the British.\u201d\u201cNothing would change quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut would a deal help create the conditions for rapprochement? Of course it would. It would take off the table the dominant element of discord.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "That College Degree: More Valuable Than Ever", "Date": "2014-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:While it seems indisputable that college graduates will, over the course of their lifetimes, earn more than those who don\u2019t graduate from college, I was still left wondering if the studies cited in your article proved the definitive economic impact of a traditional college education.We could probably identify many things that distinguish the haves from the have-nots when it comes to lifelong earnings \u2014 not the least of which are the socioeconomic privileges enjoyed by the upper-middle-class kids who populate most of America\u2019s universities today.If we insist on evaluating college as an economic value proposition (regrettable, but understandable given what it costs), we should probably identify the marketable skills students acquire over the course of four years that they didn\u2019t possess earlier, and the cost and effectiveness of alternatives that do (or could) exist.To the Editor:Certainly statistics do back up the basic fact that those with college degrees do better than those without such degrees, and that the gap between these two groups has been growing. Still, I think this focus on getting people to go to college and graduate ignores a critical problem \u2014 that many areas of employment that are expected to grow in the next 30 years (food preparation and service, the service sector, construction, home care) do not require a college degree. Nor do most of these jobs pay well or provide decent benefits.So yes, let\u2019s work on trying to get as many people to go to college and to graduate as possible. However, if we fail to address the problem of low wages of those who become employed in the many important sectors of the economy that do not require a college degree, then we will continue to live in a society in which many people are left behind.Thankfully, there are policies and remedies that could address the problem of low wages, such as enacting living wage laws and making it easier for workers in these sectors to join unions.

{"Headline": "New King or, Spaniards Ask, Is It Time for No King? ", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 There is no doubt that King Juan Carlos played an essential role in ushering Spain toward democracy, and later remained a respected voice that could speak for his nation abroad while also providing a necessary balm at critical moments to heal old wounds and mediate disputes at home from above the political fray.Yet almost four decades into the country\u2019s democratic journey, his announcement on Monday that he would abdicate in favor of his son Felipe, 46, immediately raised the question of whether Spain needed a monarchy at all. Only hours after the king addressed the nation, thousands of Spaniards took to the streets of Madrid, Barcelona and other cities to demand a referendum on whether to maintain the institution.Those who might actually vote to abolish the monarchy are probably a vocal minority. Even so, just under 50 percent of Spaniards said they supported the monarchy, according to an opinion poll published in January by conservative newspaper El Mundo and carried out by Sigma Dos.King Juan Carlos of Spain, left, and Crown Prince Felipe, his son, attended a military ceremony in January with Queen Sofia in Madrid.Some argue that Juan Carlos may have preserved the monarchy by stepping aside, however belatedly.Felipe\u2019s coronation should \u201cabsolutely help decrease anti-monarchy feelings in this country,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Antonio Zarzalejos, a political columnist and former editor in chief of the conservative newspaper ABC, who is an ardent supporter of the monarchy. \u201cThe Republican movement would have got stronger if King Juan Carlos had insisted that he should hold on, but we\u2019re now talking about a new king who comes with an absolutely clean trajectory and is in tune with the issues of our time.\u201dEven so, the king\u2019s recent problems have gone well beyond age and health issues, touching on the increasingly raw nerves over the sense of privilege that has insulated Spain\u2019s elites from the pains of austerity as the income gap widens. Primary among the king\u2019s problems was a court investigation into whether his son-in-law, I\u00f1aki Urdangarin, embezzled millions from sports events.Writing in El Mundo, Jorge de Esteban, president of the newspaper\u2019s editorial board, said that \u201cthe abdication would have been more sensible three or four years ago, when the Urdangarin scandal had not yet contaminated the Spanish crown.\u201dIn response to the recent scandals, the Spanish royal household had already become more transparent about its spending. In February, it unveiled an annual budget of 7.8 million euros (about $10.6 million), down 2 percent from 2013. It included a salary of \u20ac292,752 (nearly $400,000) for Juan Carlos and half that amount for his son. The household also revealed that the king\u2019s health problems and surgeries had cost just over \u20ac165,000 in a year.But the Spanish royal family has not disclosed the value of its assets, nor provided the kind of details available in Britain, where royal spending is made public down to laundry costs. In the most recent financial year, the British government spent 33.3 million British pounds \u2014 or about $60 million \u2014 on the monarchy.Herman Matthijs, a professor of public finance at the University of Brussels who analyzes government spending on Europe\u2019s royalty, said that the Spanish royal family\u2019s annual budget looked \u201cquite cheap\u201d compared to other monarchies, but \u201con the other hand we don\u2019t know anything about the wealth of the royal family, which is treated like a state secret, and they also really live for free because all the expenditure of their houses and palaces are in the state budget.\u201dMr. Matthijs suggested an abdication was \u201can ideal moment to make some changes and the protests in Spain showed that it might be time to move to more of a protocol system, like in the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands, where there is less power for the king.\u201dSince Monday, the anti-royal movement has spread beyond the streets of Spain. Helena Fern\u00e1ndez de Bobadilla, a Spaniard who works for an insurance broker in London, said she felt that the monarchy was \u201cobsolete\u201d and signed an online petition calling for a royal referendum.\u201cSpaniards as citizens should have the right to vote which way we want to go forward and the monarchy should earn democratically their right to reign,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately the Spanish royal family has disappointed us a lot lately.\u201dSuch a call, however, is largely falling on deaf ears. Instead, the conservative government, whose Popular Party has a parliamentary majority, drafted on Tuesday a law that Parliament is expected to adopt, allowing for the coronation of Felipe VI on June 18.Asked about the anti-royal movement, Mariano Rajoy, prime minister of Spain, said on Tuesday that such a referendum would require a change in the Constitution, and, besides, \u201cthe monarchy has the support of the great majority in Spain.\u201dThe limited prospect of a referendum has left supporters and detractors of the monarchy little alternative but to place hopes of restoring and changing the institution on Felipe, who has shown already that he can steer clear of scandal, even while increasingly substituting for his ailing father.But Felipe will also start out \u201cwith a lot less power to change things than his father, whose authority was almost unlimited when he came to the throne,\u201d said Josep Ramoneda, a writer and philosopher.While the handover in Madrid follows the similar abdication and succession of monarchs last year in both the Netherlands and Belgium, the case of Spain is \u201cquite specific\u201d and different to that of other European countries, said Mary Vincent, the head of modern European history at the University of Sheffield.\u201cIt\u2019s the only monarchy in southern Europe and southern Europe was particularly affected by the financial crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect it to be reflected in prosperous countries to the north,\u201d she added of the anti-monarchy sentiment.Juan Carlos projected the impression of \u201cprivileged aristocratic life,\u201d Ms. Vincent said. In the rest of Europe \u201cthere\u2019s definitely republican feeling, but whether people care enough to push it up the political agenda, I\u2019m rather skeptical.\u201dAlan Cowell contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Bishops Seek to Match Vatican in Shifting Tone", "Date": "2014-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 They are rethinking what kinds of houses they live in, and what kinds of cars they drive. They are wondering whether, in anticipation of the 2016 presidential election, they need to rewrite their advice to parishioners to make sure that poverty, and not just abortion, is discussed as a high-priority issue. And they are trying to get better about returning phone calls, reaching out to the disenchanted and the disenfranchised, and showing up at events.Fifteen months into the pontificate of Pope Francis, the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States find themselves unsettled in ways large and small, revisiting both how they live and what they talk about in light of the new pope\u2019s emphasis on personal humility and economic justice.\u201cThey have a justifiable demand that we not spend extravagantly on ourselves, but that we share those goods with others, and he\u2019s really forced that issue,\u201d said Bishop Blase J. Cupich of Spokane, Wash. Bishop Cupich noted that he owns no furniture and lives in a room at a seminary, and he said he is re-evaluating his diocesan budget to make sure it emphasizes assisting the poor.Bishop Gerald F. Kicanas of Tucson said he, too, thinks about Francis as he shapes his agenda, which, he said, now focuses on poverty, homelessness, addiction, violence and immigration. And, he said, he is mindful of his own spending.\u201cWe have to have a home, have to have a car that\u2019s not going to fall apart in the middle of the desert, but within reason we have to live simply,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Holy Father is such a model of trying to live with simplicity, and that is working its way into the lives of bishops.\u201d\u201cWe have to meet at a hotel that\u2019s big enough to hold us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to meet at a hotel that\u2019s big enough to allow media to attend.\u201d But the bishops are clearly watching with interest. \u201cPriests and bishops are paying close attention to what he\u2019s saying, and reading it,\u201d John Garvey, the president of the Catholic University of America, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Garvey said he was struck by how often church officials mentioned to him something the pope had only just said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember hearing that in the past about Benedict and John Paul.\u201dThe business of the bishops\u2019 meeting \u2014 presentations about clergy sexual abuse and assistance to victims of flooding in the Philippines, as well as about the church\u2019s battles against same-sex marriage and in favor of religious freedom \u2014 was planned months ago. But on Thursday morning, the bishops also spent several hours discussing poverty and the relationship between marriage and economic well-being, both topics chosen to reflect the pope\u2019s priorities. Helen M. Alvar\u00e9, a law professor at George Mason University, told the bishops that the Francis papacy was \u201can inflection point in the life of the church.\u201d\u201cWe need to keep talking about the hot-button issues that we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time, but not just those issues,\u201d Archbishop Gregory M. Aymond of New Orleans said in an interview. He added, \u201cWe don\u2019t, perhaps, at times talk enough about the poor, about the economy, and we don\u2019t perhaps talk enough about reaching out to those with disabilities, those whose voices are not heard.\u201d Archbishop Aymond said he has tried to address this in one small way himself, by returning phone calls and letters, and by reminding himself, \u201cpeople shouldn\u2019t always have to go through several others to get to us.\u201dArchbishop Joseph E. Kurtz of Louisville, Ky., the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, told the gathering that, if the voters\u2019 guide is not revised, \u201cit will not include anything of the teachings of Pope Francis.\u201d And Bishop Robert W. McElroy, an auxiliary bishop in San Francisco, suggested that the document\u2019s discussion of evil, now focused on abortion and racism, should be revisited in light of the pope\u2019s description of economic inequality as a social evil. Cardinal Daniel N.

{"Headline": "A Tug-of-War of Tax Breaks Tightens Across the Hudson", "Date": "2014-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate last fall, bankers from BNY Mellon went to state officials in New York and New Jersey with a proposition: The bank was planning to sell its headquarters on Wall Street and was looking for office space on either side of the Hudson River for more than 1,100 employees.The bankers wanted to know who would cut the best deal.In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s administration responded quickly with a hefty offer \u2014 nearly $100 million worth of tax credits \u2014 if the bank would move one mile west to Jersey City.New York countered with its own incentive package that real estate executives say is worth millions of dollars if the bank remains in Lower Manhattan.The bank is leaning toward New York, real estate executives say, but no victor has been announced and officials on both sides of the Hudson refused to discuss the high-stakes negotiations.The tug-of-war is the latest skirmish in what is becoming a fierce competition between New York and New Jersey to heap subsidies on some of the country\u2019s wealthiest corporations as enticements. With a struggling labor market, jobs are precious to both states, but in New Jersey there is also a political factor: Mr. Christie is widely presumed to be a contender for the Republican presidential nomination and has promoted himself nationally as a prudent financial steward.So while offering incentives to businesses is a common practice across the country, New Jersey has been extraordinarily generous under Mr. Christie, awarding over $4 billion in subsidies \u2014 tax breaks and credits \u2014 since 2010 to JPMorgan Chase, Forbes, American Dream Meadowlands, RBC Capital and other corporations. But that also raises questions about how well Mr. Christie is managing the state\u2019s economy, since many critics argue subsidies are an ill-advised use of taxpayer money that fail to yield significant economic benefits.Some of the subsidies went to companies already in New Jersey \u2014 Panasonic got $102.4 million to move its headquarters nine miles within the state. New York State, by comparison, has provided more modest incentives.Mr. Christie has used every deal to trumpet his success at job creation. \u201cJPMorgan Chase Bank\u2019s decision to choose New Jersey exemplifies our enhanced ability to compete in the regional, national and global economy,\u201d the Economic Development Authority said in a news release issued last month after the state\u2019s decision to provide the bank with $224.8 million in tax credits over 10 years.\u201cWe will always compete for every job,\u201d said Timothy J. Lizura, president of the development authority. \u201cWe\u2019ll put our most compelling proposal forward. But there\u2019s no upfront money. It\u2019s only after the companies have created jobs, retained them and made the promised investments.\u201dThe average cost of the subsidy package has soared to $75.9 million from $10.1 million and the amount of tax forgiveness per promised job has jumped to $47,916, from $16,430, according to New Jersey Policy Perspective. Just this week, the state announced $82 million in tax breaks to the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team to move its training facility from Pennsylvania to Camden.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Gordon MacInnes, the president of Policy Perspective, \u201cwhere such large chunks were granted to a handful of corporations.\u201dCritics contend that incentives are nothing more than corporate welfare, giveaways to companies that hardly need them and whose motivation for relocating \u2014 which can be expensive and disruptive if employees do not want to move \u2014 is usually dictated by market demand, not by subsidies.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a huge waste of resources,\u201d said Jon Whiten of Policy Perspective, \u201cwhen it\u2019s pretty clear that these sorts of tax breaks are not essential to location decisions.\u201dThe resources could be better spent, critics say, on transportation and education, which benefit all businesses and citizens. Instead, tax breaks deprive the state of revenues and shift more of the tax burden onto small and medium-size businesses, whose threats to relocate do not get the same attention.Since the 1980s, New Jersey has lured Goldman Sachs, Depository Trust and Clearing Corporations, U.S. Trust, Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Trust into moving parts of their operations to Jersey City from Manhattan. In general, the companies moved lower-level or back-office employees to less expensive locations.A few years ago, the Christie administration also provided Prudential Insurance $250.8 million in incentives to move a few blocks within Newark.But with the state\u2019s economy still staggering, New Jersey has been busy striking a string of cross-border deals.RBC Capital Markets, a division of the Royal Bank of Canada, recently got up to $78.75 million to transfer about 900 employees from Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, instead of Minnesota, according to the Economic Development Authority.RBC, which will maintain its American headquarters in Lower Manhattan, is moving to New Jersey\u2019s tallest building, which Goldman Sachs built in 2004 with $164.3 million in state tax credits. The tower, which was built to accommodate over 6,000 employees, was never fully occupied, after equity traders for Goldman balked at being transferred from Manhattan.The Christie administration also struck a $224.8 million deal with JPMorgan Chase after the bank threatened to move its New Jersey operations to Delaware and Ohio. The bank agreed to retain 2,612 employees and promised to add 1,000 new jobs in Jersey City.Chase had gotten about $100 million in tax breaks in 2000 from New Jersey to move about 5,000 technical jobs from Manhattan to a new building in Jersey City. State officials say that those jobs are not included in the latest deal.The administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has brokered its own subsidy deals, albeit on a smaller scale, with major corporations.This year, Time Inc., which publishes Time magazine and 20 other brands, threatened to move to New Jersey from its longtime home in Midtown. New York agreed in May to provide the company with $10 million \u2014 a $3 million tax credit and $7 million in cash \u2014 to move instead to Lower Manhattan.Several other companies received incentives without even threatening to leave New York. The state agreed to provide GroupM, a large media company, $15 million in cash if it moved downtown from Midtown. Two companies that are part of New York\u2019s fast-growing technology sector, Etsy and Square, each got $5 million in tax credits.Kenneth Adams, commissioner of the New York State Department of Economic Development, played down the notion of a border war. \u201cWe don\u2019t focus on states,\u201d he said. \u201cWe focus on companies, primarily on strategic industries that are poised for growth.\u201dKathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a coalition of business leaders, said competing with New Jersey was foolhardy. \u201cIf you look at the history of corporate tax subsidies,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s not a pretty picture. What\u2019s silly about these border wars is that we\u2019re really, in many respects, one economy.\u201dBut that does not seem to be the case when it comes to BNY Mellon. The bank reportedly has a handshake deal to move to Brookfield Place, a downtown office complex in Battery Park City. According to real estate executives who have been briefed on the matter, the state plans to provide a form of rent aid through the Battery Park City Authority that could be worth $2 million a year.Advertisement"}

The number of design firms in Brooklyn doubled between 2003 and 2012, from 265 to 532.In organizing the biennial, which will tackle a new city in two years, Mr. Adamson also has an eye on the museum marketplace and positioning the museum as a distinct brand. He mentioned the more famous biennial across town at the Whitney as a point of reference.\u201cThe kind of spiky, theoretical programming is being done so well at other spaces that I think we can become a point of entry for people,\u201d Mr. Adamson said. \u201cLook where we are: the corner of Central Park.

{"Headline": "Filmmakers", "Date": "2014-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistIn his previous book, \u201cPictures at a Revolution,\u201d Harris used the five best picture nominees of 1967 as a way of exploring how movies both reflected and were transformed by the tumultuous \u201960s. This time around, the interlocking stories of how, when, where and why five prominent American filmmakers of the 20th century went to war become the skeleton for a compulsively readable work of cultural history. The actual war stories are gripping: John Ford took a shrapnel wound shooting the Battle of Midway; William Wyler came home almost totally deaf; George Stevens, a director known for lightweight comedy, personally photographed the liberation of Dachau. But \u201cFive Came Back\u201d is about much more than Hollywood\u2019s contribution to the war effort.Part of Harris\u2019s thesis is that his five subjects \u2014 the three mentioned plus Frank Capra and John Huston \u2014 were all changed immensely, in ways that reflect how the movie industry and the country as a whole were changed. Four of the five would embrace the altered tone of cultural seriousness that followed the Allied victory and create the greatest works of their lives, while Capra, the ultrapatriotic Italian immigrant, would find that his career was all but over. In this must-read for movie buffs and World War II aficionados alike, Harris also examines Hollywood\u2019s engagement with political power, censorship, anti-Semitism and the boozy, masculine code of conduct that prevailed among the filmmaking fraternity.Charlie Chaplin directed an enormous number of films, and controlled his own productions to a degree perhaps unparalleled in cinema history. Of course he also starred in nearly all of them, and Chaplin\u2019s fame as a performer has swamped efforts to consider him as a director. Kornhaber tries to set that right with this fascinating academic study, which forcefully rejects the oft-repeated claims that Chaplin was, at best, a serviceable craftsman whose mission was to capture his own genius as a performer.Such interpretations, Kornhaber argues, are based not just on a limited understanding of Chaplin\u2019s directing as stodgy and unimaginative but also on a set of ideological assumptions about how filmic storytelling works. To Chaplin\u2019s critics, his technical and formal decisions \u201cdo not read as choices but as mistakes,\u201d because they are not seen as valid choices within what film scholars call \u201cthe Hollywood classical paradigm.\u201d Chaplin favored an immobile camera, a wide frame, little variation in camera angles and long takes with minimal editing, during which competing characters and narratives often collide and overlap. His remarkable use of space and his preference for simultaneity over sequence, multiplicity over unity and a skeptical ambiguity over clarity mark his work as \u201cat one and the same moment old-fashioned and ahead of his time,\u201d looking backward to the English music hall and forward to the French New Wave.In a restless, peripatetic career, Ulmer directed Yiddish movies in New Jersey, health shorts aimed at African-American and Latino audiences, World War II propaganda films, the pilot episode of the \u201cSwiss Family Robinson\u201d television series and numerous crime, horror and sci-fi flicks: \u201cBabes in Bagdad,\u201d \u201cGirls in Chains,\u201d \u201cThe Man From Planet X.\u201d Ulmer was never rewarded with the opportunities or recognition he deserved, but as Isenberg says, he was a master of mood and atmosphere who brought an Old World high-culture sensibility to a body of work \u201cthat often defied industry-imposed standards and norms.\u201dAs even casual fans of Steven Spielberg\u2019s movies know, the 1971 television film \u201cDuel\u201d holds a special place in his career. It came three years before \u201cThe Sugarland Express,\u201d the young director\u2019s first theatrical feature, and four years before \u201cJaws.\u201d A nearly wordless low-budget drama starring Dennis Weaver as an ordinary motorist pursued by a homicidal truck driver whose motives remain obscure, \u201cDuel\u201d captured the attention of critics, industry executives and ordinary viewers for its economy and mounting tension, immediately marking the 24-year-old Spielberg as a filmmaker to watch. \u201cAfter \u2018Duel,\u2019 everything fell into place,\u201d Spielberg has said, adding that he always thought of \u201cJaws\u201d as a sequel to the earlier film, another paranoid fable of the contest against the forces of implacable evil and chaos.To reconstruct the story of \u201cDuel,\u201d Awalt interviewed both Spielberg and the screenwriter Richard Matheson (also the author of the original magazine story), along with others associated with the shoot, and accumulated a large amount of documentary material, including a draft of Matheson\u2019s teleplay. No doubt Spielberg completists and film scholars of the future will find a use for this highly detailed account. But Awalt never attempts anything beyond a cursory reading of \u201cDuel,\u201d and seems unable to tell the difference between trivia and genuinely fascinating anecdotes, like the young Spielberg\u2019s first meeting with Federico Fellini.ANDREW O\u2019HEHIR is a film critic and political columnist for Salon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Media Stocks Climb After Aereo Defeat", "Date": "2014-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market moved modestly higher on Wednesday, recovering more than half of what it lost the day before, as investors looked beyond two disappointing economic reports.Shares in CBS and other broadcasters rose after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of them over Aereo, a start-up Internet company, in a closely watched copyright case.\u201cThe trend for this market is still, for the time being, up,\u201d said Anastasia V. Amoroso, a global market strategist with J.P. Morgan Funds. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 9.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,959.53. The index fell 12.63 points the day before.The Nasdaq composite index rose 29.40 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,379.76 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 49.38 points, or 0.3 percent, to 16,867.51. Both the S.&P. 500 and the Dow remain in striking distance of their all-time nominal closing highs, which they hit last Friday.Consumer discretionary stocks were among the biggest advancers, a sector that includes broadcasters and other media companies. The Supreme Court ruled that Aereo would have to pay broadcast companies when it takes television programs from the airwaves and allows subscribers to watch them on portable devices.It was a major win for the broadcast industry, which had argued that Aereo should have to pay for programming the same way cable and satellite providers have to.CBS jumped $3.64, or 6.2 percent, to $62.48 and Walt Disney, which owns ABC, rose $1.22, or 1.5 percent, to $83.90. Comcast, which owns NBC, picked up 57 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $53.21, while 21st Century Fox gained 67 cents, or 2 percent, to $34.88. TV station owners also rose. Sinclair Broadcasting jumped $4.58, or 15.7 percent, to $33.82. Barry Diller\u2019s IAC/InterActiveCorp, the principal financial backer of Aereo, fell 33 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $68.93. Investors were not fazed by two negative economic reports released on Wednesday.In a revised estimate, the Commerce Department said the nation\u2019s economy shrank at a greater-than-expected annual rate of 2.9 percent in the first three months of the year. The Commerce Department also said orders for durable goods fell an unexpected 1 percent in May as demand for military equipment fell sharply. \u201cG.D.P. for the first quarter was not bad, it was horrible,\u201d said Doug Cote and Karyn Cavanaugh of Voya Investment Management, in a note to investors.Among the stocks on the move, Monsanto jumped $6.10, or 5.1 percent, to $126.73 after the giant corn and soybean seed company reported earnings that exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates and announced plans to buy back up to $10 billion of its stock. Barnes & Noble rose $1.09, or 5.3 percent, to $21.65 after the bookseller said it would split into two publicly traded companies, one focused on retail bookselling and one on its Nook Media business, which sells e-readers.Pioneer Natural Resources rose $11.42, or 5.2 percent, to $233.07 and Enterprise Products rose $1.03, or 1.4 percent, to $77.14 after the government granted the companies permits to export a light, processed form of crude oil, loosening a longstanding ban on oil exports.In the bond market, interest rates dipped.

{"Headline": "Central Bankers, Worried About Bubbles, Rebuke Markets ", "Date": "2014-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 An organization representing the world\u2019s main central banks warned on Sunday that dangerous new asset bubbles were forming even before the global economy has finished recovering from the last round of financial excess.Recovery from the financial crisis that began in 2007 could take several more years, Jaime Caruana, the general manager of the B.I.S., said at the organization\u2019s annual meeting in Basel on Sunday. The recovery could be especially slow in Europe, he said, because debt levels remain high.The B.I.S. provides financial services to national central banks and also acts as a setting where central bankers can discuss monetary policy and other issues like financial stability or bank regulation. The board of directors includes Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve; Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank; and the heads of central banks from Japan, China, India and many other countries.The organization, which reflects a widespread view among central bankers that they are bearing more than their share of the burden of fixing the global economy, often uses its annual reports to send a message to political leaders, commercial bankers and investors. But the B.I.S.\u2019s language in the 2014 edition was unusually direct, as was its warning that the world could be hurtling toward a new crisis.He described the report \u201cas a call to action.\u201dThe organization said governments should do more to improve the performance of their economies, such as reducing restrictions on hiring and firing. The report also urged banks to raise more capital as a cushion against risk and to speed efforts to deal with past problems. Countries that are growing quickly, like some emerging markets, must be alert to the danger of overheating, the group said.\u201cThe signs of financial imbalances are there,\u201d Mr. Borio said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are emphasizing it is important to take further action while the time is still there.\u201dThe B.I.S. report said debt levels in many emerging markets, as well as Switzerland, \u201care well above the threshold that indicates potential trouble.\u201dYet investors show no sign of being deterred. This month, for example, investors snapped up $1.5 billion worth of bonds sold by the government of Kenya. The debt paid an interest rate of 6.875 percent, very low for a country that has deep economic problems and has been rocked by terrorist bombings.In contrast to many economists and analysts, the B.I.S. played down the risk of deflation, a downward spiral in prices that can have devastating economic effects. When deflation takes hold, people stop spending because they expect prices to fall further. Company profits slump, and unemployment rises.In Europe, an intense debate has taken place about whether the region could slip into deflation, and whether the European Central Bank should be pumping more money into the euro zone economy as a countermeasure.Mr. Borio said it was unlikely that there would be a repeat of the kind of catastrophic deflation that occurred during the Great Depression. He noted that prices have been falling in Switzerland for several years, but the country has continued to grow, and unemployment is low.\u201cWe are not saying deflation is not a problem,\u201d Mr. Borio said. \u201cBut we would like to try to take a little bit of the emotion out of the debate.\u201dThe organization also had harsh words for corporations, which it said were not taking advantage of booming stock markets to step up investment. That is one reason that gains in productivity \u2014 the foundation of sustained economic growth \u2014 have slowed in most advanced economies, the bank said.\u201cDespite the euphoria in financial markets, investment remains weak,\u201d the B.I.S. said. \u201cInstead of adding to productive capacity, large firms prefer to buy back shares or engage in mergers and acquisitions.\u201dThe overall, somewhat gloomy message from the central bankers was that the world is drunk on easy money and has already forgotten the lessons of recent years.\u201cThe temptation to postpone adjustment can prove irresistible, especially when times are good and financial booms sprinkle the fairy dust of illusory riches,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe consequence is a growth model that relies too much on debt, both private and public, and which over time sows the seeds of its own demise.\u201dAdvertisement"}

While not easy on businesses, this has ultimately been good for consumers, as retailers and restaurateurs dug deep in the treasure chest of Spanish talents and traditions \u2014 not to mention agricultural bounty \u2014 to weather the economic storm. Before that storm, Madrid seemed frantic to become a copy of any other European metropolis, but now the city feels more Spanish again. Resourcefulness, creativity and reinvention are bubbling up in art galleries, designer ateliers and restaurants. The city\u2019s symbol may be a bear, but for style, culture, history and sybaritic delights, there are plenty of reasons to be bullish on Madrid.FRIDAYGet a maritime perspective on world history and the naval events that shaped Spain\u2019s vast empire from 1492 to the present at the Museo Naval (3 euros, or $4 at $1.33 to the euro). Against a backdrop of wall-size paintings of Christopher Columbus stepping ashore in the Americas, or bird\u2019s-eye depictions of famous battles like Trafalgar, emblems of Spanish naval prowess abound, from the earliest explorers to the last days of empire. There are hundreds of intricately rigged model galleons and clipper ships, some large enough to sail away on, vivid reminders that Spain once ruled the seas and apparently kept excellent records of every voyage. As the museum is part of a government ministry, visitors need a valid photo ID.Global luxury brands once dominated the prime storefronts in Madrid\u2019s upscale shopping district known as Barrio Salamanca, with local talent and independent designers shoehorned into tiny spaces and appointment-only ateliers.

{"Headline": "Obama to Take Action to Slash Coal Pollution", "Date": "2014-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Monday will announce one of the strongest actions ever taken by the United States government to fight climate change, a proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulation to cut carbon pollution from the nation\u2019s power plants 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, according to people briefed on the plan who spoke anonymously because they had been asked not to reveal details. The regulation takes aim at the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States, the nation\u2019s more than 600 coal-fired power plants. If it withstands an expected onslaught of legal and legislative attacks, experts say that it could close hundreds of the plants and also lead, over the course of decades, to systemic changes in the American electricity industry, including transformations in how power is generated and used. It is also likely to stand as President Obama\u2019s last chance to substantially shape domestic policy and as a defining element of his legacy. The president, who failed to push a sweeping climate change bill through Congress in his first term, is now acting on his own by using his executive authority under the 1970 Clean Air Act to issue the regulation.Under the rule, states will be given a wide menu of policy options to achieve the pollution cuts. Rather than immediately shutting down coal plants, states would be allowed to reduce emissions by making changes across their electricity systems \u2014 by installing new wind and solar generation or energy-efficiency technology, and by starting or joining state and regional \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs, in which states agree to cap carbon pollution and buy and sell permits to pollute.E.P.A. officials have said they hope the flexible approach will allow states to comply with the regulation more easily and cost-effectively, by adopting policies best tailored to regional economies and energy mixes. But industry groups planning to sue to block or delay the rule have said that approach makes the rule more legally vulnerable. The details of the proposed regulation were first reported Sunday afternoon by The Wall Street Journal online. Because burning coal is the largest source of the greenhouse gas emissions that scientists blame for trapping heat in the atmosphere and dangerously warming the planet, the rule is expected to have a powerful environmental impact. It comes on top of a regulation Mr. Obama issued in his first term that sharply increased the required fuel economy of vehicles, the second-largest source of carbon pollution in the United States.Experts said that the new regulation would set the United States on track to meet its target set forth in a United Nations accord in 2009, when Mr. Obama pledged that the United States would cut its greenhouse gas pollution 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 percent by 2050.On Sunday, environmental advocates praised the proposed rule for its breadth and reach while the coal industry attacked it as a symbol of executive overreach that could wreak economic havoc. Republican campaigns plan to use the rule to attack incumbent Democrats in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Scott Segal, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, which represents coal companies and plans to sue over the rule, wrote in an email, \u201cClearly, it is designed to materially damage the ability of conventional energy sources to provide reliable and affordable power, which in turn can inflict serious damage on everything from household budgets to industrial jobs.\u201dLast week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a report warning that the rule could lower the gross domestic product by $50 billion annually.The proposal to be unveiled Monday will be a draft, open to public comment, and is certain to set off a wave of lobbying from states, industry groups and environmentalists seeking to shape the final version of the rule. While there is no legal deadline for finalizing the regulation, Mr. Obama has directed the E.P.A. to issue the rule by June 2015 so that the administration can begin putting the program in place before he leaves office.Nations around the world are closely scrutinizing the climate change rule and its prospects.The timing of the rule signals that Mr. Obama may be more interested in achieving a legacy-making global deal on climate change than in short-term political concerns. While the rule could make things politically difficult for incumbent Democrats from coal states in November, it could make things easier for American climate change negotiators this fall at the United Nations General Assembly, where governments are expected to hold side meetings intended to forge a global climate change treaty that negotiators hope to have signed by 2015.Over the long term, the United States has been the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon pollution, but today China is the largest, with India and other developing Asian countries poised to see an explosion in their carbon pollution in the coming years as millions of people join the middle class and begin enjoying cheap coal-fired electricity. But China and India have resisted American pressure to cut their own carbon pollution because, they have said, the United States has no moral authority to push other nations to cut pollution when it fails to do so at home.State Department climate negotiators hope that by bringing the new E.P.A. rule to the table, they will be able to demonstrate significant action and have fresh leverage to broker a deal. \u201cI fully expect action by the United States to spur others in taking concrete action,\u201d Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, said.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Defying Russia, Ukraine Signs E.U. Trade Pact", "Date": "2014-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Dealing a defiant blow to the Kremlin, President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine signed a long-delayed trade pact with Europe on Friday that Moscow had bitterly opposed. He then declared he would like his country to one day become a full member of the European Union.In so doing, Ukraine\u2019s new leader, a billionaire confectionary magnate, has in effect raised a risky bet on the West that has cost his country hundreds of lives and the loss of the Crimean peninsula to Russia and has set off a low-level civil war in its eastern border region.By signing the trade pact at the Brussels headquarters of the European Union, Mr. Poroshenko revived a deal whose rejection last November by his predecessor, Viktor F. Yanukovych, set off months of pro-European protests in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, and pushed the West into its biggest test of wills with Russia since the end of the Cold War.The unrest toppled Mr. Yanukovych and drove pro-Russian activists in Crimea and the eastern region of Donetsk to demand annexation by Russia.In a dig at Mr. Yanukovych, he said he had signed the agreement with the same pen that his toppled predecessor would have used to sign the same pact, before he changed his mind under pressure from Moscow and set up his own downfall.The completion of the association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine marked a severe setback for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his oft-repeated goal of reasserting Russian influence in the \u201cnear abroad,\u201d Moscow\u2019s term for the territories of the former Soviet Union.Moldova and Georgia, two other former Soviet lands that Moscow had pressured not to stray too far from its orbit, also signed agreements with the European Union on Friday. In Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, citizens celebrated with a large public concert, which was broadcast on all major domestic television channels.There was jubilation as well in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, after the signing of the agreement. By late afternoon on Friday, several hundred people had gathered in Independence Square, the focal point of months of street protests, many carrying blue balloons with yellow paper stars affixed to them \u2014 replicating the European Union flag \u2014 and released them into the air.After weeks of statements by Mr. Poroshenko vowing to seal the agreement, the Kremlin was well-prepared and immediately began to lay the groundwork for retaliatory measures, including the withdrawal of preferential treatment for Ukrainian exports to Russia under prior agreements between former Soviet republics.Within minutes of the signing ceremony, the news agency Interfax quoted Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister as warning that \u201cserious consequences\u201d would follow. The remark was an ominous sign of the vexation caused in Moscow by the tilt toward Europe of lands that Russia, first under czarist and then Soviet rule, for centuries considered its own.In Moscow, Mr. Putin blamed the months of crisis in Ukraine on Western leaders, saying they had forced Kiev to choose between Russia and the European Union.\u201cThe acute crisis in this neighboring country seriously troubles us,\u201d Mr. Putin said after a ceremony to receive the credentials of foreign diplomats. \u201cThe anti-constitutional coup in Kiev and attempts to artificially impose a choice between Europe and Russia on the Ukrainian people have pushed society toward a split and painful confrontation.\u201dThough spurned, Moscow retains enormous influence in Ukraine. It reminded Kiev of this earlier this month by suspending deliveries of natural gas following a long-running dispute over price. Russia has denied any hand in the violence in eastern Ukraine but has been accused by the West of supporting pro-Russians rebels with guns, money and manpower from across the border in Russia.Given the ferocity of the Kremlin\u2019s campaign to prevent completion of the accord between Ukraine and Europe, the reaction by senior officials on Friday was relatively muted, reflecting not only acceptance of the inevitability of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s signing but also the changed circumstances following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, where it has a naval base.\u201cIn the Kremlin, they are calming down and trying to assess the results of this frenzied state of affairs over the last couple of months,\u201d said Konstantin Sonin, vice rector of the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. \u201cI think we make too much rationalization of what the Kremlin does. I think they were very much driven by events.\u201dOne of Mr. Putin\u2019s major objections to closer political and economic relations between Ukraine and the West was widely understood to be a concern about NATO expansion, and the risk that would pose to Russia\u2019s military interests in the Crimean peninsula.Russia has long viewed the European Union as a stalking horse for NATO but, in a move that could help allay such concerns, NATO foreign ministers decided in Brussels earlier this week that a summit meeting in September will not approve offering Georgia a formal step to membership.There is no chance of the European Union admitting Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova as members any time soon. Public opinion in Europe is hostile to any further expansion of a 28-nation bloc that is already widely seen as too big and too unwieldy.Far from concluding a period of tumult, the completion of the trade deal, which still needs approval from the Ukrainian Parliament, could further stoke tensions both inside Ukraine and between Moscow and the West.Senior Russian officials quickly began warning that Russia\u2019s businesses and economy could suffer, as their markets could be flooded with low-cost goods from Europe that skirt tariffs by first being shipped through Ukraine, which will be exempt from most European duties. Other experts have dismissed those concerns, saying Russia is quite adept at identifying and intercepting such goods as they cross the border.European leaders, meeting Friday at a summit in Brussels dominated by wrangling over who should lead its executive arm for the next five years, announced that they would not immediately impose additional sanctions on Russia for its interference in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. But, they said in a statement that additional sanctions were being prepared and could be deployed \u201cwithout delay\u201d if Russia does not do more to curb violence in eastern Ukraine.Europe, like the United States, has so far limited its sanctions to an asset freeze and travel ban against a narrow group of Russian political and military figures involved in the March annexation of Crimea.European leaders set a deadline of next Monday for pro-Russian militants to leave borders posts seized from Ukrainian personnel, to release all hostages, agree to procedures for the verification of a cease-fire and accept \u201csubstantial negotiations\u201d on a peace plan proposed by Mr. Poroshenko.In eastern Ukraine, in the embattled regional capital of Donetsk, Aleksandr Borodai, a rebel leader from Russia, told reporters that pro-Russian militias were willing to extend a truce until Monday. The Ukrainian government later agreed to do so.Andrew Higgins reported from Brussels, and David M. Herszenhorn from Moscow.

{"Headline": "Putin's Crossed Vision", "Date": "2014-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Many of the great empires of the past thought of themselves as having grand global missions. The European colonial powers of recent centuries liked to think of themselves as bringing the advantages of Western civilization to less fortunate lands. The Soviet Union \u2014 at least among its more idealistic adherents \u2014 was dedicated to spreading the gospel of Communism. In turn, the United States embraced the spread of free-market capitalism and democracy as its international mission.Today, the president of my country, Vladimir Putin, also has a grand vision of what Russia\u2019s place in the world should be. The problem is that no one really knows exactly what his goals are or how he plans to achieve them. What\u2019s worse, perhaps he himself doesn\u2019t know. The big question is, what message does this send to the rest of the world? It\u2019s not that Mr. Putin hasn\u2019t spoken about his vision, or rather, two of his visions. One is the protection of Russians who he says, by the accidents of history, now live in the world beyond the Motherland. The other is the creation of a vast Eurasian economic union. But these two goals contradict each other. Mr. Putin has famously characterized the collapse of the Soviet Union as the 20th century\u2019s largest catastrophe. He later pointed out that he was referring mostly to the \u201chumanitarian\u201d (rather than the ideological) aspect of that historic collapse. Since the 1990s, millions of Russians have found themselves outside their country\u2019s post-Cold War borders. Russia, therefore, has to reconstruct and embrace its own, ethno-centric version of that new international doctrine \u2014 the responsibility to protect. But before he could begin to act upon that goal, Mr. Putin had to set the stage. In the decades since the fall of Communism, Russian leaders, including Mr. Putin, were preoccupied with ending their country\u2019s internal disarray. Mr. Putin has succeeded in doing so, but his agenda has been achieved through negative measures, by removing all hindrances to the smooth operation of the Kremlin \u2014 those bothersome elements that the West sees as the building blocks of democracy: a free press, impartial courts, citizens\u2019 associations and opposition parties.Thus, our president has succeeded in making the press compliant, Parliament acquiescent, the courts obeisant and business neutralized as a political actor. This has all been helped by strong economic growth and periodic outbursts of patriotic militarism, maintained through broad if unenlightened public support. (Although Mr. Putin has repeatedly declared that Russia has made an unambiguous choice in favor of democracy, he likes to point out that the \u201cstandards used in some countries could hardly be put into practice or are inapplicable in other countries.\u201d)This raises the question: Can a leader whose actions are so negative at home become a successful player in international politics? It is no accident that the conflict in Ukraine started over the prospect of Kiev signing an association agreement with the European Union. The Kremlin has a traditional antipathy to following rules set by other powers. And the European association agreement would have introduced a set of rules that Moscow would not have been able to control or change. Mr. Putin has justified his Crimea land grab and his manipulation of East-West divisions in Ukraine by asserting that he was acting to protect Russians living abroad. Yet no evidence of harassment against Russian citizens has emerged. Even during the violence on the Maidan in Kiev, only one Russian citizen was reportedly killed. Nevertheless his persistent rhetoric was instrumental in persuading dozens of radical Russian nationalists to join separatist militias in Donetsk and Lugansk. Many of those volunteers have died fighting the Ukrainian Army. One can hardly call this a successful campaign to protect citizens abroad. Meanwhile, his other big project, Eurasian integration, has been haphazardly unfolding. Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia formed a customs union in 2010, went on to declare the creation of a common economic space in 2012, and last month signed a treaty to establish the Eurasian Economic Union. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have promised to join before the end of this year, but the whole project has been undermined by the glaring absence of Ukraine. The treaty proclaims that its adherents will benefit from \u201cfour freedoms\u201d \u2014 of movement of goods, services, capital and labor. But many policy differences remain, and the formation of a supranational governing organization and joint monetary and financial policies have been postponed. The parties are expected to proceed to a uniform set of regulations in 19 economic sectors, but the rules governing the most important market \u2014 the oil and gas sector \u2014 may not be in place before 2025. A union that includes Ukraine, with its population of 44 million (more than twice that of Kazakhstan and four times greater than Belarus), would have a more diversified economy and strong \u2014 if severely strained \u2014 ties to Russia\u2019s industrial complex. \u201cFrom an economic point of view, Ukraine\u2019s market and strong industrial base could have been a crucial element in the development of the integration process,\u201d writes Timofei Bordachev, a prominent Moscow economist. He says that Ukraine could have acted as a counterweight to Kazakhstan, \u201cwhose political importance now outweighs its real potential\u201d and that it \u201ccould have offered constructive opposition to Russia.\u201d And therein lies the problem. If Mr. Putin\u2019s grand project is based on a vision of ethnic nationalism, he needs to continue putting pressure on Ukraine, including support for the Russian-speaking separatists in the east and south. If his priority is a Eurasian union, which depends upon international cooperation, he needs to include Ukraine.The vision of ethnic solidarity might be tempting for the Kremlin because it is a proven tool to rally domestic support for almost any policy. But it\u2019s a dangerous path that would further isolate Russia. The integration project, however difficult and less popular, has the potential to eventually produce lasting ties between Russia and the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BY HEWLETT-PACKARDBy Jaydine Sayer At a time when media companies conduct massive market research to pick and promote even low-budget projects, there\u2019s at least one organization that\u2019s still choosing projects the old-fashioned way \u2014 picking great, original and unique stories.  Content is still king at the Sundance Institute, the nonprofit founded in 1981 by Robert Redford to support independent film and theater artists. The Institute is also the force behind the eponymous film festival held every January in Utah.  \u201cWe believe it\u2019s the powerful, authentic stories that end up resonating with audiences and take them places they didn\u2019t even know they wanted to go,\u201d\u009d says Keri Putnam, executive director of the Sundance Institute.  That doesn\u2019t mean the nonprofit shuns the type of cutting-edge technology you\u2019d find at big film studios. In fact, Sundance embraces \u2014 even pursues \u2014 new media platforms and innovations to help engage audiences for its films, documentaries and even new-media products that defy definition.  While Sundance prioritizes the artistic and social impact of its films over their commercial promise, it\u2019s quick to adopt new technologies that help create passionate audiences willing to spend money.  Crowdfunding as a tool and a barometer  \u201cKickstarter, Indiegogo and other innovative funding platforms are really transformative for independent projects of a risk-taking nature, the kind we support at Sundance,\u201d\u009d says Putnam. \u201cWe see people not only raising money for projects; they also develop an early fan base around their work.\u201d\u009d  These crowdfunding sites serve a dual purpose \u2014 to fund films and to market them. When a film comes out, supporters often spread the word about a project, acting as ambassadors for it, Putnam explains.  \u201cCrowdfunding sites are directly connected to what we call the \u201d\u02dcmaker economy,\u2019 and it\u2019s growing momentum exponentially,\u201d\u009d says Sarah DaVanzo, chief cultural strategy officer at the trend-spotting agency Sparks & Honey.  \u201cWhat\u2019s cool about Kickstarter-like sites is that they match people who have a goal with people who want to be part of something innovative,\u201d\u009d adds DaVanzo. \u201cSo two needs are being met, and we see no signs of the trend slowing down.\u201d\u009d  DaVanzo says participating in crowdfunding gives people a chance to do something creative, even if only in a monetary way. \u201cPeople want to be part of something special,\u201d\u009d she says.  \u201cKickstarter is a place where you can begin to talk meaningfully about audience demand,\u201d\u009d says Putnam. \u201cYou can immediately see if there is an audience out there responding to what you\u2019re saying,\u201d\u009d she says, \u201cthe artist can then talk directly to that audience and find out what it is they are excited about and why. And then the artist can run toward that if they choose.\u201d\u009d  Supercharging digital distribution  Distribution of films is a huge challenge for Sundance, especially since many of its artists still hope for a big deal with a professional film distributor. When those deals don\u2019t happen \u2014 not everyone gets tapped by Harvey Weinstein \u2014 Sundance turns to its powerful partners.  Creating partnerships with media companies who excel at distribution is one tactic Sundance takes to help. The Institute has deals in place with Netflix, iTunes and Hulu, among others, to provide access for its filmmakers to make their films available for download or streaming, a growing trend.  The Institute is also forging partnerships with emerging companies with innovative technology tools: \u201cCompanies that offer a way to stream your film, market your film, talk to your fan base, sell your merchandise, book a theatrical distribution tour \u2014 all in one place,\u201d\u009d says Putnam.  Two companies, Tugg and Gathr, are already helping artists connect with viewers who want to go to the cinema to experience a film. These companies use crowdsourcing to book theaters around the country, so artists can essentially plan an entire theatrical campaign, on demand, directly with fans.  Riding the e-wave  It\u2019s hard to champion new technology if you don\u2019t know about it.  \u201cWe have a team dedicated to consuming digital content and thinking about the ways audiences are receiving and talking about it,\u201d\u009d says Putnam. But it\u2019s not just this team that fosters discovery of new technology \u2014 it\u2019s part of Sundance\u2019s culture.  \u201cAll the curious, creative people at Sundance use new tools to think about content all the time,\u201d\u009d she says. \u201cWe made it a value to bring these conversations into the office.\u201d\u009d  For all the work Sundance does to educate artists about the brave new world of digital media, the flow goes two ways. Tech-savvy artists and art-minded technologists have never had a more fertile moment to inspire one another and push the boundaries of creativity.

{"Headline": "How Inherited Wealth Helps the Economy", "Date": "2014-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIs inherited wealth making a comeback?Moreover, given economists\u2019 abysmal track record in forecasting, especially over long time horizons, any such prognostication should be taken with a shaker or two of salt. The Piketty scenario is best viewed not as a solid prediction but as a provocative speculation.But it raises the question: So what? What\u2019s wrong with inherited wealth?First, let\u2019s consider why parents leave bequests to their children. I believe that this decision is based on three principles:And it doesn\u2019t stop there, because future generations will also care about their children. Generation Two\u2019s utility depends on Generation Three\u2019s utility, which depends on Generation Four\u2019s utility, and so on. As a result, each person\u2019s utility depends not only on what happens during his own lifetime but also on the circumstances he expects for his infinite stream of descendants, most of whom he will never meet.Because of diminishing marginal utility, people typically prefer a smooth path of consumption to one that jumps around. Consuming $50,000 of goods and services in each of two years is generally better than consuming $80,000 one year and $20,000 the next. People smooth consumption by saving in good times and drawing down assets when conditions are lean.This phenomenon is clearest for the most extreme cases. In their own times, John D. Rockefeller and Steve Jobs each created one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies and made a ton of money along the way. They must have known it was unlikely that their children would accomplish the same feat.Together, these ideas explain why top earners often leave sizable bequests to their families. Because of intergenerational altruism, they make their consumption and saving decisions based not only on their own needs but also on those of their descendants. Because of regression toward the mean, they expect their descendants to be less financially successful than they are. Hence, to smooth consumption across generations, they need to save some of their income so future generations can consume out of inherited wealth.From a policy perspective, we need to consider not only the direct effects on the family but also the indirect effects on the broader economy. Rising income inequality over the past several decades has meant meager growth in living standards for those near the bottom of the economic ladder, and one might worry that inherited wealth makes things worse. Yet standard economic analysis suggests otherwise.When a family saves for future generations, it provides resources to finance capital investments, like the start-up of new businesses and the expansion of old ones. Greater capital, in turn, affects the earnings of both existing capital and workers.Because capital is subject to diminishing returns, an increase in its supply causes each unit of capital to earn less. And because increased capital raises labor productivity, workers enjoy higher wages. In other words, by saving rather than spending, those who leave an estate to their heirs induce an unintended redistribution of income from other owners of capital toward workers.The bottom line is that inherited wealth is not an economic threat. Those who have earned extraordinary incomes naturally want to share their good fortune with their descendants. Those of us not lucky enough to be born into one of these families benefit as well, as their accumulation of capital raises our productivity, wages and living standards.N.

{"Headline": "Cameron\u2019s Protests Rebuffed as European Commission Leader Is Chosen", "Date": "2014-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Despite bitter opposition from Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, European Union leaders voted on Friday to name Jean-Claude Juncker as the next president of the bloc\u2019s powerful bureaucracy, bringing an end to a struggle that had pitted some of the group\u2019s top leaders against each other.The vote for leadership of the European Commission came after Mr. Cameron made a last ditch plea over lunch in Brussels with leaders to select someone other than Mr. Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg who played a central role in steering Europe through its long debt crisis.Previously, European leaders always selected the president of the Commission by consensus.Mr. Cameron and Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, were the only two to vote against the nomination of Mr. Juncker, who still must be approved by the European Parliament in a vote expected to be held on July 16.Joseph Daul, the leader of the European People\u2019s Party, which backed Mr. Juncker, said he was \u201cconfident\u201d of a majority for their candidate in Parliament. Mr. Juncker would seek \u201cthe widest-possible consensus,\u201d Mr. Daul said.Mr. Cameron had strongly objected to Mr. Juncker as someone unlikely to curb the kind of bureaucratic overreach that many European voters \u2014 not least those in Britain \u2014 rejected in elections in May. Mr. Cameron had also complained that Mr. Juncker was being foisted on leaders by the European Parliament in a power grab that threatened to permanently downgrade the influence of national governments in Brussels.\u201cThis is a bad day for Europe,\u201d Mr. Cameron told a news conference following the summit meeting. \u201cThis whole process has simply reinforced my conviction that Europe needs to change,\u201d he said, adding that he was not the sort of person to \u201cback down when a vote goes against you.\u201dBut the outcome was a clear sign that member states would side with Germany, the biggest economy in the European Union and its most influential member, over Britain, which has indicated that it could leave the 28-member bloc in coming years.In the longer term, the failure of the British to get their way in Brussels could raise pressure on Mr. Cameron to begin advocating a departure from the European Union. Mr. Cameron has previously said that his goal was to win reforms in areas like immigration and to slim down the responsibilities of the European Union, allowing Britain to remain in the bloc on revised terms.Mr. Cameron said the job of keeping Britain in a reformed European Union has become harder. \u201cThe battle to reform this organization is going to be longer and tougher,\u201d he said.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said in a separate news conference that Mr. Juncker had \u201cEuropean experience\u201d for the job. But she also was \u201cready to address British concerns\u201d about the European Union, including the selection process that had so riled Mr. Cameron.Whether Britain remains a formal member of the bloc is likely to be a key issue in the British general election campaign next year. Mr. Cameron has previously pledged to hold a referendum in 2017 on whether Britain should remain a member if he wins re-election.The decision about who should lead the organization\u2019s most important agency was always going to be an acrimonious process after populist upstart parties on the right and left surged in legislative elections in May.The drubbing of mainstream parties in the voting for the European Parliament by parties like the National Front in France and the U.K. Independence Party put into stark relief the challenge facing the project to integrate the Continent, which began in the wake of World War II.For Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the Europe Program at the German Marshall Fund, \u201cthe struggle over the new European Commission president is one about the democratic future of the E.U.\u201d and \u201cthe battle over Juncker shows how real it all has become.\u201dIn May, European Union leaders, including Ms. Merkel, said they would look at a range of candidates for president as part of a process in the union\u2019s treaties and to take other issues into account, like placing more women in top jobs and accommodating the wishes of each member government in the bloc.But Ms. Merkel faced strong domestic pressure to name Mr. Juncker after her own party had backed him as a leading candidate during the election campaign, and after Mr. Juncker\u2019s party won a majority during elections to the European Parliament in May. Many Germans warned that ignoring the results of the elections by choosing an outside candidate could create further resentment of Brussels.Sweden and the Netherlands had also been skeptical about the process for nominating Mr. Juncker. But their leaders also voted for him on Friday, adding to the impression that Mr. Cameron had been left in the lurch.Asked whether Ms. Merkel had let him down over Mr. Juncker, Mr. Cameron said \u201cobviously we were on opposing sides today and that\u2019s a matter of regret.\u201dMs. Merkel declined to discuss any assurances she gave Mr. Cameron to seek alternatives to Mr. Juncker, saying she did not comment on such \u201cinternal discussions.\u201dUnder the Lisbon Treaty, which went into force in 2009, European Union leaders are responsible for naming the candidate, whom the Parliament then elects. But parties in the European Parliament outmaneuvered the leaders by putting forward their own candidates for the top job in Europe.\u201cThere is no longer any going back on this leap for democracy,\u201d said Pervenche Ber\u00e8s, a French member of the European Parliament, immediately after the vote on Friday. \u201cFor the first time the president of the European Commission will take his legitimacy from citizens,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Women in Midlife, Career Gains Slip Away", "Date": "2014-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTracy Murphy was managing a nonprofit agency five years ago when her mother became seriously ill with heart problems. She promptly left her job to care for her, a task that has consumed Ms. Murphy ever since.\u201cFor me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d said Ms. Murphy, who lives in Syracuse. \u201cWhen I was growing up she sacrificed for me.\u201dMs. Murphy, 54, set aside her career aspirations, drained her savings account and eventually sold her gold jewelry to help make ends meet while shuttling her mother, who is 85, to doctors\u2019 appointments and running errands.\u201cI always felt like I can find another job eventually \u2014 but I only have one mother,\u201d she said.Ms. Murphy is part of a small but economically significant group that is bucking a powerful decades-long movement of women of all ages into the labor market. In the years since the last recession began, many women like Ms. Murphy, in their late 40s and early 50s, have left the work force just as they were reaching their peak earning years.The demands on middle-aged women to care for their parents, particularly during difficult economic times that force many families to share resources, are not the only reason for the shift. Some economists also attribute the unexpected phenomenon to extensive budget cuts by state and local governments, which employ women in large numbers and were hit harder during this recession than in previous downturns.\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster for the women concerned,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, an independent economist, \u201cbut it\u2019s also bad news for the economy because they are not contributing to growth and their skills are eroding through extended inactivity.\u201dAs the economy struggles to get back on track, the labor participation rate remains feeble for almost everyone. Still, the losses affecting this group of women \u2014 who normally would be in the prime of their careers \u2014 stand out from the crowd and highlight the challenges facing middle-aged workers who, for whatever reason, find themselves out of a job.Since the start of the recession, the number of working women 45 to 54 has dropped more than 3.5 percent. There are now about one million fewer women of that age in the labor force than at their peak at the end of 2009. For younger women the rate of decline was about 2 percent \u2014 and many of those in their 20s dropped out to return to school or left the work force temporarily to focus on caring for young children.Men, too, have been pushed out of the labor market as jobs in the construction and manufacturing industries have been slow to return. But the rate of decline among adult men has largely tracked the curves of the economy and has been spread more evenly across ages.Mr. Shepherdson, who highlighted the drop in working women in a recent report for his firm, Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that even in a slow-growing economy \u201cwomen\u2019s participation should not have fallen at all, especially among the women in their prime earning years.\u201dThe fact that more elderly people are living longer may be behind many middle-aged women\u2019s decision to stop working. Most employers do not offer flexible schedules for workers caring for elderly family members. And increasingly, women in their 40s and 50s are sandwiched between caring for aging parents and their own dependent children, including young adults still living at home.A Pew Research Center survey conducted in October 2013 reported that 27 percent of the women surveyed had quit their job to care for a child or family member.Sarita Gupta, co-director of Caring Across Generations, an advocacy group for home care workers and patients, said the difficulties can stack up. \u201cWomen are falling out of the work force to be primary caregivers to aging parents,\u201d she said, \u201cbut as women go out of the work force it means they sacrifice their own financial security.\u201dAARP\u2019s Public Policy Institute estimates that women 50 and over who leave the work force permanently to care for a parent lose nearly $325,000 in wages and benefits.\u201cIt saves a lot of money but there\u2019s a huge personal sacrifice,\u201d said Jeannie Brown, 49, of Belgrade, Mont., who left her job as an accounting clerk for county government in 2009 to care for her disabled granddaughter and her mother, who had a stroke.The toll that caregiving takes is more than financial. Researchers say depression and anxiety are common among women who care for an older relative.The decline in public employment also appears to have played a major role in the exodus of middle-aged working women. Between September 2008 and April of this year, 640,000 state and local government workers lost their jobs, according to Labor Department data. Almost half were in education, an industry where a typical employee is a woman in her 40s.In Birmingham, Ala., for example, most of the nearly 300 teachers laid off in recent years were women who had been with the district 15 to 20 years, according to the local teachers union. In Trenton, many of the roughly 200 school district workers laid off since 2009, union officials said, were female support staff members who lost their jobs when cafeterias, paraprofessional services and school security teams were privatized.In Chicago, Katherine White was laid off in 2011 from her job teaching writing and history to fifth and sixth graders. Initially, her life was a whirl of activity as she fine-tuned her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and applied for numerous full-time teaching positions.\u201cI tell you, I really thought I had the job in a lot of cases, and it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Ms. White, 56, said.In 2012 she accepted a temporary teaching position for one semester. When that job ended, she started firing off r\u00e9sum\u00e9s again. \u201cNo nibbles in over a year,\u201d she said.She picked up a few tutoring jobs to help pay her bills, but a few weeks ago Ms. White abandoned her search. She signed up for computer technology classes in hopes of finding a job in a new field.\u201cA lot of teachers, we say we\u2019re too young to retire and too old to be competitive with the market out there,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re between a rock and a hard place, and you have to know how to navigate through it and reinvent yourself.\u201dSome economists think jobs for women in education and other fields will come back eventually, assuming the economy picks up steam and government budgets improve. The dropout trend is \u201cinteresting and potentially disturbing but it may be transitory,\u201d said Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University labor economist and expert on women and the economy.By contrast, Ms. Goldin noted, the participation rate for women 55 and over increased in the years after the recession, suggesting that many older women are eager to keep working as long as they can.For women laid off after having settled into a career, the hurdles, both real and imagined, can be significant, according to job counselors. Middle age is a fragile time, they say, and older women often lack the confidence of younger women when forced to look for a new job. They also face the challenges of all older workers: Employers may view them as too expensive, overqualified or out of touch with the changing demands of the workplace.Denice Sharpe, 51, was laid off from her information technology job in Durham, N.C., in September 2008, the same month Lehman Brothers collapsed. In 2012, she finally gave up looking in her field and enrolled in culinary school. She is hoping to start a business creating a line of low-carbohydrate fresh food.\u201cThose of us who have been put out to pasture prematurely should actually be about creating a new economy based on small businesses and based on whatever kinds of talents you have that weren\u2019t being used in a formal 9-to-5 job,\u201d she said.Sharon Ritchie, 51, has been looking for work since she was laid off in 2009 after a 16 year-career at a state-run hospital in New York. She lives in Yonkers with her mother, who has helped her financially.\u201cAfter a while you get tired of hearing no, no, no,\u201d she said. But \u201cI don\u2019t give up. That ain\u2019t me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Secretary Points to Lackluster Economy and a Need for Action", "Date": "2014-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Has Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew just become the most prominent member of the secular stagnation club?In a speech before the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday morning, Mr. Lew discussed the \u201cquestions about whether America can maintain strong rates of growth and doubts about whether the benefits of technology, innovation and prosperity will be shared broadly.\u201dSecular stagnation has become the new dominant anxiety of many economists and policy makers in Washington, with the employment crisis finally fading and the economy on a slow upward trajectory five years after the end of the recession.What happens if the economy simply never shifts into high gear? What if the rich continue to take bigger and bigger slices of the pie? What if the middle class never gets richer, and growth never becomes strong enough to improve the lives of the poor? What do policy makers do then?Mr. Lew cited some disturbing numbers from the Congressional Budget Office that point to such stagnation. From 1948 to 2007, the United States economy grew on average 3.4 percent a year. The budget office now projects that the economy will grow 2.1 percent a year, in part because of slower growth in the work force but also because of weaker gains in productivity and a slower pace of innovation. Over time, that means an economy trillions of dollars smaller.Mr. Lew argued that policy makers should not be complacent in the face of the country\u2019s demographic, structural and labor-market challenges. And he gave a laundry list of policies that might help to lift growth rates: overhauling the tax code, changing the broken immigration system, creating new work force-training initiatives, making higher education more affordable and investing in infrastructure improvements.Fixing the immigration system, he argued, might have an enormous impact on economic output. \u201cImmigration reform is good economic policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the immigration reform bill, which passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis last year, would increase the labor force, boost G.D.P. by 3.43 percent over the next 10 years and improve our fiscal position by $158 billion, strengthening the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\u201dMany of those ideas have bipartisan support, Mr. Lew said. But even if that is true, Congress has also become less and less capable of compromise of late, with political commentators in broad agreement that Washington is likely to remain stalemated on major legislation at least through the end of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tea Party Dead-Enders", "Date": "2014-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Tea Party is five years old this election season, which means it\u2019s done teething and spitting up on itself, but still prone to temper tantrums, irrational outbursts and threats to take its toys and storm off if it doesn\u2019t get its way.As a movement, it is down to a couple of former talk-radio hosts running for office in two states of the old Confederacy, Texas and Mississippi. And in the latter, the Senate candidate, Chris McDaniel, has given a keynote to a group that considers Abraham Lincoln a war criminal. It\u2019s not hard to make the case that the Tea Party has been distilled down to it logical essence.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to go to the moon,\u201d said the comedian Bill Maher. \u201cThey want to howl at it.\u201d Still, the Tea Party has also been around long enough to have a record, of sorts. Let\u2019s look at the legacy:No significant legislation, no changes for the better in American life, and no compromise, of course, with the majority of voters who say in numerous polls that the Tea Party has been mostly a negative force in politics. One follows the other, since by the absolutist nature of their philosophy Tea Party members believe that any effort to govern with those they disagree with is traitorous.But they did bring us \u2014 drumroll \u2014 the government shutdown! Remember last fall, an extortionate attempt to deprive millions of Americans access to health care through an established law? It was ruinous. The economy took a direct hit of more than $20 billion, and 800,000 people were without a paycheck. An extremist fringe of one party in one house of one branch of government brought the day-to-day functions of the United States to a standstill.It could have been worse. Because the other big Tea Party idea is government default \u2014 walking out on your commitments. This is the debt ceiling, in which Congress validates the spending that it has already agreed to pay for. The Tea Party came up with the idea of making the government not unlike the rancher in Nevada who refuses to pay his bills for grazing cattle on the public range. A deadbeat. You can see why Cliven Bundy became a Tea Party hero, until his overt racism made him toxic.So, no legislation. A shutdown that cost billions. A near-default that almost threw the United States back into recession. What else? Oh, science denial. Evolution, climate change, medicine \u2014 all a hoax, in one form or another.But the Tea Party does have something to show for its five years of annoyance: Ted Cruz, senator from Texas. Cruz is probably best known for reading \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d on the floor of the Senate during a 21-hour talkathon designed to ensure his place as the most hated man in that august chamber. But Cruz, in trying to kill funding for the Affordable Care Act, missed the point of the Dr. Seuss classic: don\u2019t criticize something until you actually try it. And now that more than eight million Americans are trying insurance that won\u2019t deprive them of health care just because they got sick, green eggs and ham is likely to be a dish served cold to Cruz.Elsewhere on the personnel front, the Tea Party kept writers on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d busy. There was Christine \u201cI\u2019m not a witch\u201d O\u2019Donnell, routed in a Senate race the Republicans could have won in Delaware. They put forth Todd \u201clegitimate rape\u201d Akin in Missouri, and Richard \u201crape is something that God intended\u201d Mourdock in Indiana, both gifts to the Democratic Party.And don\u2019t forget the soon-to-be-retired member of Congress Michele Bachmann, founder of the Tea Party Caucus. If Bachmann were to put out a greatest-hits compilation of her craziest statements, she would need a double album. Her most harmful outburst was a claim that a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer in young women was dangerous. She knows this because \u201ca lady\u201d told her that her child \u201csuffered from mental retardation\u201d after getting the vaccine.Which brings us to the last Tea Partiers standing. All along, surveys have shown that the Tea Party is thick with aging white men, angry, fearful, in open revolt against the new American demography. And their ideas came not from Republican Party elites or conservative think tanks, but from the true fount of Tea Party philosophy \u2014 talk radio.No surprise, then, that the leaders of the last skirmishes being fought in the Tea Party rear guard are people who came out of the fear-breeding hothouse of far-right broadcasting. The latest Tea Party star in Texas is Dan Patrick, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor \u2014 not to be confused with the likable sports radio host of the same name.The Texas Patrick is of course a climate-change denier, and he warns of a Mexican \u201cinvasion\u201d by illegals who bring \u201cthird world diseases\u201d with them, like polio. He keeps the fact-checkers fully employed. But he embodies other Tea Party heroes because of his glaring hypocrisy: This strong advocate for fiscal responsibility once declared personal bankruptcy, walking out on about $800,000 in debts in the 1980s. The people he stiffed are still angry.In Mississippi, Chris McDaniel, the candidate who forced aging Senator Thad Cochran into a runoff later this month, is an even better distillation of Tea Party essence. For old whites, he can count on the support of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, whose members claim the Emancipation Proclamation was illegal, and have put up billboards wishing a happy birthday to \u201cPresident Jefferson Davis.\u201d McDaniel gave a keynote last summer to one of their affiliates.He\u2019s likely to be Mississippi\u2019s next senator.

{"Headline": "Key Details of E.P.A. Carbon Emissions Proposal", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 The E.P.A. expects that under the regulation, 30 percent of electricity in the United States will still come from coal by 2030, down from about 40 percent today.\u2022 The E.P.A. estimates that the rule will cost the economy $7.3 billion to $8.8 billion annually, but will lead to benefits of $55 billion to $93 billion, primarily by preventing premature deaths and mitigating respiratory diseases.\u2022 Critics complain that the rule will drive up electricity costs, but the agency forecasts that the rule will increase energy efficiency across the power sector, leading to lower electricity bills when the program is fully implemented in 2030.\u2022 The rule will not, on its own, lower greenhouse gas pollution enough to prevent catastrophic effects of climate change. But, in combination with other regulations, it would allow the United States to meet its commitment to the United Nations to cut carbon pollution 17 percent by 2020 and press other major polluting countries, particularly China and India, to follow suit.\u2022 The draft proposal is just the beginning of the process to cut emissions. The agency will now take public comment and spend the next year completing the proposal before releasing the final rule in June 2015. States will then be given another year to submit compliance plans, or apply for an extension.\u2022 The rule is not an executive order. Under the Clean Air Act, the E.P.A. is required to regulate any substance defined as a pollutant, which the law defined as substances that endanger human life and health. A 2007 Supreme Court decision led to an E.P.A. determination that carbon dioxide is a pollutant, thus requiring that the agency regulate it or be in violation of the law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Upscale Dairies Grow in India, Promising Safer Milk", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHolstein-Friesian cows laze in the sun on a 26-acre dairy farm a couple hours\u2019 drive inland from Mumbai. The dairy, Pride of Cows, is one of the largest players in India\u2019s growing farm-to-table milk business.GURGAON, India \u2014 On a 26-acre farm a couple hours\u2019 drive inland from Mumbai, hundreds of black-and-white Holstein-Friesian cows laze around, dining on seasonal greens and listening to a custom playlist of rap, pop, classical and even devotional music. They are treated to a routine medical checkup before heading to a \u201crotary milking parlor,\u201d where their udders are gently squeezed, until the cows step away, at will.Within a day, the milk \u2014 never touched by human hands \u2014 is bottled and whisked away to hotels, restaurants and homes in nearby cities.Devendra Shah, the chairman of Pride of Cows\u2019 parent company, Parag Milk Foods, regularly uses the word \u201clove\u201d to describe his operation, referring to his cows as \u201cpampered and cherished.\u201dThis new marketing approach targets an increasingly health-conscious and brand-savvy Indian consumer, a growing niche within an already swelling middle class that has the means to afford costlier products. But the appeal of this milk is as much about food safety, after a milk adulteration scandal shocked the nation.In a country where dairy is considered a fundamental life force, let alone most people\u2019s main source of animal protein, the revelations struck many as surreptitious sacrilege. This past January, India\u2019s Supreme Court strongly suggested that states around the country join Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal in amending their penal codes to punish milk adulteration with possible life sentences.Indian entrepreneurs have responded to regular milk\u2019s troubled reputation by leasing farms and opening dairies that pledge fresh, 100 percent pure milk.Nikhil Vora, a former managing director at a market analysis firm in Mumbai, said that the so-called farm-to-home market accounted for less than 1 percent of the $70 billion market for milk, cheese, yogurt and other dairy products. But the segment is forecast to increase by more than 20 percent a year.Pride of Cows provides 10,000 liters daily to customers through its subscription service in Mumbai and nearby Pune, including five-star hotels and a French cr\u00eaperie called Suzette. The milk costs about 75 rupees ($1.24) a liter, almost double the rate for pasteurized milk at a neighborhood store.Pride of Cows reaches customers much the same way a new winery or brewery might. The company regularly attends food exhibitions and invites potential or existing customers to the farm for guided tours. Pride of Cows has also expanded its outreach into schools, mostly private, hosting workshops on nutrition and enrolling 150 students for a planned 45-day internship this summer through which participants \u201cwill get hands-on experience in the various aspects of Pride of Cows\u2019 business operations,\u201d according to a company spokeswoman.The Parisian who runs Suzette, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Sabbagh, said he tried Pride of Cows\u2019 milk at a food exhibition and was struck by the \u201chuge difference in taste.\u201d \u201cWe realized at some point that many of our customers were already their customers,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s mostly those who\u2019ve just started a family and want to make sure that they are eating the healthiest possible food,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said. \u201cThese are well-placed professionals who may be influenced by the organic food movement abroad.\u201dThe push into such premium products comes even as the broader economy shows signs of weakness. Chakradhar Gade, a graduate of the Indian Institute of Management who quit his job as a financial analyst, sees the dairy business as recession-proof.About a year and a half ago, Mr. Gade and a business partner subcontracted a farm just outside Delhi, with around 50 cows, to form Country Fresh Milk. He went door to door in Delhi\u2019s sprawling technology suburb of Gurgaon, and found a receptive consumer base of young professionals, new families and recent arrivals from rural communities who missed the taste of farm-fresh milk and were skeptical of regular milk\u2019s purity.Most milk adulteration occurs at the small-scale farms that supply most major milk companies. By adding water, farmers can increase the volume they are able to sell, while other additives increase the fat content and thus the value of the milk.Mr. Gade spends 5 percent of his revenue on quality control. An independent lab tests his milk weekly as it leaves his farm, checking for water, fat and 24 other adulterants.Despite the extra costs, the company is charging the going rate for regular milk, and Mr. Gade said many customers immediately wanted to make the switch. He plans to keep his prices low until he has a more solid customer base.After adding four more farms, Country Fresh Milk now delivers milk, cheese and clarified butter to 1,000 customers in Gurgaon. He said his goal was to eventually supply 4 percent of Gurgaon\u2019s daily milk consumption, which he estimates is around 500,000 liters a day.Sanjay Sharma, the founder of Mothers Nature Foods, also in Gurgaon, said he saw pure milk as a moral imperative as well as a business opportunity.\u201cMy guru, Avdhoot Shivanand Baba, advised me to start this business,\u201d Mr. Sharma said, referring to his spiritual adviser. \u201cHe explained the concept of \u2018life force energy\u2019 to me, wherein the fresher the food, the greater the energy that one can derive from it.\u201dFormerly a flight instructor in California and Europe, Mr. Sharma bought two cows because he missed the quality of milk he was able to get abroad. Three years later, his company has over 500 cows on two farms, and 2,000 customers.At Mr. Sharma\u2019s new farm in Alwar, Rajasthan, he operates a \u201cspa for cows,\u201d where he is landscaping waterfalls into the pasture to replicate a \u201cvillage atmosphere\u201d that he says cows are used to. \u201cI thought if I can make my cows healthy and happy,\u201d Mr. Sharma said, \u201cthen I\u2019ll also get even more good hormones in the milk.\u201d\u201cBig Milk is slow poison,\u201d he said, referring to India\u2019s dominant dairy producers. \u201cSee how we only get one or two medals in the Olympics? People aren\u2019t even growing properly here anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Terrorists Got Rich", "Date": "2014-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionA FEW feet from the Bab al-Salam border crossing near the Turkish town of Kilis, there is a shabby cafe where the most interesting items for sale are not found on the menu. The cafe is the final stop for young radicalized men from Europe or North Africa who are planning to slip past the lax Turkish border officers and into Syrian territory. This is where they exchange their passports for cash. When one of us visited the cafe in January, a Belgian passport was for sale for $8,000. A buyer could have it altered for movement to Europe or visa-free travel to the United States. New passport photos were being snapped in the parking lot.Half a continent away, in Kuwait, on an evening in March, a soon-to-be auctioned 1982 Chevy Caprice Classic awkwardly sat parked on carpets outside a tent. Inside potential bidders were being asked to alleviate the suffering of Syrians with \u201chumanitarian contributions.\u201d Few could have had any doubt that once their money found its way to Syria, fighters \u2014 some affiliated with Al Qaeda \u2014 would decide whether to use it to buy aspirin for children or ammunition for killers. On June 10, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, moved on Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city. The advance blew the uniforms off hapless soldiers and police officers, and left prison cells and bank vaults emptied of their contents. In the largest bank holdup in recent memory, ISIS operatives reportedly stole up to $400 million in cash. Flush with money, ISIS will have the resources (as well as the territory) to establish itself as the hub of a global terrorist movement in the heart of the Middle East. There are no Treasury paratroopers to send in to seize the cash, or bank regulations to issue to stop ISIS from spending it.These three episodes reflect a deep problem for the United States and its allies that has been evolving for several years. The campaign to disrupt and dismantle terrorist financing after 9/11, which met with much success and once caused Osama bin Laden to bemoan the lack of funding in Al Qaeda coffers, has given way to a new reality. The metastasized, Qaeda-inspired terrorist movements have learned to raise millions of dollars locally, while the conflicts in Syria and Iraq have resurrected the terrorist funding networks of old. Terrorist funding is now both local and global.Donors and everyday citizens from the Persian Gulf and other sympathetic corners of the world, witnessing the humanitarian crisis in Syria, have been funneling money to the most effective forces fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad there, namely Qaeda-affiliated groups and ISIS. Smartly, these groups have realized they must match their brutal militancy with charitable services, akin to the governance and charity models of groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. This makes it difficult to differentiate funding to alleviate the suffering of Syrian refugees from support for terrorism. Alongside these global revenue streams, terrorist networks have gotten better at taking advantage of local moneymaking opportunities. In North Africa, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has the market cornered on kidnap-for-ransom and smuggling operations to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. It has used its resources to buy more weapons to assault Malian and French forces and to support the training of Boko Haram operatives, while Boko engages in its own hostage-taking for profit in West Africa. The Taliban and Haqqani networks in Afghanistan and Pakistan also run smuggling and kidnapping operations, while profiting from the heroin trade. The Shabab movement in Somalia has developed a trade-based money-laundering system through the export of charcoal and import of sugar, while imposing taxes in areas it controls. In earlier days, ISIS made plenty of money on petty crimes, bank robberies and oil smuggling. Today, with its control of territory growing in Syria and Iraq, it has established a war economy. ISIS militants have taken control of resources like granaries and oil installations and are extorting \u201ctaxes\u201d from businesses and selling off government property and equipment (an inventory that now includes American-made Humvees). This has spawned a for-profit militant model that breathes life into insurgencies around the world.ISIS is also a leader in using new technologies and social media to raise awareness and reach individual donors. Appeals for donations (or investments) are tweeted while money is raised and sent via the Internet, then withdrawn in the form of bags of cash to be transported into the war zones. The ISIS publication Al-Naba (The News) has kept donors informed about the progress of specific operations, while Twitter feeds are updated with body counts and photos of the equipment and territory fighters now control.If we hope to constrict these global and local fund-raising streams, and the dangerous ambitions of terrorist groups, we need a renewed campaign against terrorist financing. But we cannot cut off the financing to a group like ISIS without first dislodging it from the territory it controls. And this requires a broader counterterrorism campaign. This has been done in the past \u2014 during the surge in Iraq in 2007, and when Kenyan forces ran the Shabab out of the lucrative port of Kismayo in Somalia in 2012. It does not necessarily have to be done by American forces on the ground, but it does require forces allied with the United States to separate ISIS from the resources it controls and the economy it now runs.Unfortunately, a clear strategy for doing this and American leadership have been absent amid the caldron of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Meanwhile, we have lost the on-the-ground intelligence and military capabilities provided by task forces like the Iraq Threat Finance Cell, created in the mid-2000s to track and disrupt insurgency and terrorist funding.Our options and appetite for more investment of blood and treasure in the fight against terrorism may be limited, but without addressing all dimensions of the financing threat, our progress over the years may be lost. If groups like ISIS can fill their coffers, run economies and consolidate their hold on power, we may be facing a new, more dangerous brand of global terrorism that will threaten the United States and its allies for years to come.Advertisement"}

The S.&P. 500 rose 2.50 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,956.98. The Dow Jones industrial average added 14.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,906.62. But the Nasdaq composite index slipped 3.51 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,362.84. The string of record highs has the S.&P. 500 running well ahead of its 50-day moving average. That suggests it could be ready for a pullback, said Jim Russell, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. He still expects the market to move higher in coming months.\u201cWe think the environment is still favorable for equities to have an upward bias,\u201d Mr. Russell said. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to put the bear suit on.\u201dDespite its upward bent, the market has been mostly registering small moves, reflecting a cautious mood on the part of many investors heading into summer, as well as lingering concern over the possible fallout from the crisis in Iraq and questions over the resiliency of the American economy.The economy shrank at an annual rate of 1 percent in the first quarter, weighed down by a severe winter that slowed business activity. Many analysts anticipate growth will have rebounded strongly in the second quarter.\u201cWe know the economy is showing signs of improvement, and we\u2019ve seen that trajectory over the past two or three months,\u201d Mr. Russell said. \u201cTo move the equity market to a higher level we need to see anecdotal evidence that company earnings are starting to increase.\u201dThe market will get a sense of that next month, when the next round of corporate earnings begins. Until then, the next key market mover will most likely be the June employment report, due out the first week of July.Among the stocks on the move, Coach was the biggest loser in the S.&P. after the luxury goods company said it would shutter about 70 underperforming stores in a bid to regain ground lost to competitors. Its stock fell $3.50, or 8.9 percent, to $35.69. Stock in Pier 1 Imports tumbled $2.40, or 13.1 percent, to $15.86 after the furniture retailer\u2019s quarterly profit fell short of Wall Street expectations. In contrast, Kroger shares rose $2.39, or 5.1 percent, to $49.66 after the supermarket operator raised its earnings forecast for the year.In the bond market, interest rates moved higher.

The gains outside of military goods suggest business spending is picking up, which could give the economy a much-needed lift. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that orders, excluding defense, rose 0.6 percent in May, after falling 0.8 percent in April. Orders for core capital goods, which reflect business investment, increased 0.7 percent, after a 1.1 percent drop.

{"Headline": "New Father? New C.E.O.? There\u2019s a Boot Camp for You", "Date": "2014-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShortcutsIN the face of the yelling, B. J. Perlmutt hesitated, then took the plunge. After all, this was boot camp, and wasn\u2019t the point to break you down and make you a man? He was sweating a little but competently finished the task.The shrieking stopped. Mr. Perlmutt had changed his first diaper.His analysis? \u201cI forgot the diaper cream at first, and I was worried the diaper was too tight, but it was nice to see her stop crying.\u201dFirst camps for troubled teenagers adopted the name. Now there are boot camps for computer programming, physical fitness, meditation and executive leadership. Need to clean up your house or work on your marriage? There\u2019s a boot camp for you. The costs range from free to more than $10,000.Few of these activities have much in common, but they all use the term boot camp to sell a concept: transformation. The common idea behind the military model is that if you push your physical limits, persevere and bond with your comrades, your body and soul will be forever changed.But does any of this really work? Despite the proliferation of these programs, are people really being helped \u2014 or simply had? Is there any way to determine if this approach \u2014 submerging yourself in a subject matter \u2014 is actually useful?\u201cThe appeal of boot camps is that they sound tough. You challenge yourself and come out with well-earned learning,\u201d said Annie Murphy Paul, author of the coming book, \u201cBrilliant: The Science of How We Get Smarter.\"\u201cBut the paradox of the boot camp style of learning is that it makes learning too easy. When we\u2019re engaged in long periods of practicing one thing, we get really good at it when it\u2019s fresh in our minds, and we have a feeling of fluency,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re persuaded we\u2019ve really mastered something, which we haven\u2019t in any effective way.\u201dThat\u2019s because, counterintuitively, cognitive science has repeatedly demonstrated that people learn better when they forget a little and then relearn, Ms. Paul said.\u201cIt\u2019s the struggle to relearn and reassimilate that makes learning more long-lasting,\u201d she said.In fact, said Nate Kornell, a professor of psychology at Williams College, in most cases people will learn and remember things more efficiently and effectively if they do it, for example, in 40 hours over three months rather than for 40 consecutive hours.\u201cYou want to learn something and then wait awhile to do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cForgetting is the friend of learning.\u201dBut Professor Kornell also noted that that held true only if people worked as hard in the spaced-out lessons as in the intensive programs, which often wasn\u2019t the case.What can be beneficial about some of these boot camps, he said, is not the immersion process itself, but that the camps inspire and motivate people to learn.But, \u201cwhile we\u2019re not physically demanding \u2014 we\u2019re not making people run up a hill with a hundred-pound pack on their backs \u2014 it\u2019s emotionally demanding,\u201d he said.Mr. Colonna said his year-old program forces new chief executives to ask questions like \u201c \u2018Who am I and what do I want to build?\u2019 This brings out feelings of insecurity and inadequacy.\u201dIn the program, three coaches \u2014 an actor/psychotherapist, yoga instructor/art therapist and expert in meditation and organizational development \u2014 offer experiential workshops for $8,500 to $10,000.Campers, as Mr. Colonna calls the participants, are not just sitting and listening to someone talk, \u201cbut talking among themselves about their fears and challenges.\u201cGenerally, people are crying on the first night,\u201d he said.There might be some crying also at computer programming boot camps, which tend to be intensive, monthslong experiences. Brandon Croke, a spokesman for Dev boot camp, said it was his company that pioneered the programming boot camp idea in 2012 in San Francisco. The demand is such that in the last two years, he said, 55 other computer programming boot camps have sprung up nationwide, and five of his graduates have started their own boot camps.The costs of these programming boot camps vary, but Dev is fairly average. For $12,200 for 18 weeks (nine weeks \u201cvirtual prep\u201d and nine weeks in San Francisco, Chicago or Manhattan) classes of about 23 people learn coding. While that may indicate a lucrative business, Mr. Croke said much of the money was put into the facilities and maintaining the low teacher-to-student ratio.Would-be programmers can work 70-80 hours a week during the on-site classes, which include meditation and mindfulness, Mr. Croke said. The goal is to learn not just technical skills but also self-awareness and empathy (the Dev in the name stands for development). About 650 students have graduated.Like military boot camp, the focus is on both mind and body. \u201cIt\u2019s transformational,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go in as one person and come out as another.\u201dWell, at least as a person with a lighter wallet.Perhaps the best-known use of the term boot camp outside the military involves physical fitness. Generally, those are high-intensity programs that don\u2019t require specialized equipment, said Walter R. Thompson, a professor of kinesiology and health at Georgia State University.Because \u201cmost people are curious about the training the U.S. Marines go through, but do not wish to enlist.\u201d So the gym, based in Manhattan, offers similar training, and \u201cyou will feel like you are part of a team and become bonded as a close-knit team.\u201dParticipants will be yelled at, but only in a nice way. Teachers won\u2019t \u201cabuse, harass or degrade.\u201dBut they may inadvertently hurt you.Such classes, $50 for an hour at Warrior Fitness, work \u201cif you\u2019re already engaging in a good exercise program,\u201d Professor Thompson said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just starting out, not so much. It could get you injured or give you a heart attack.\u201dAnd while some physical fitness boot camps are responsible about weeding out those who aren\u2019t up to it, \u201cothers just want to separate you from your money,\u201d he said.Unlike the computer programming boot camps, the physical fitness boot camp fad seems to be diminishing, however. Professor Thompson said such camps burst on the scene when the economy collapsed around 2008, maybe because they don\u2019t require expensive equipment or clothing \u2014 and sometimes not even a gym, as many are held outdoors.So back to our Boot Camp for New Dads, where no group could be more motivated to learn the basics of infant care than this one. Oscar Vasquez, 32, a staff sergeant in the Air Force, who attended the Tribeca class, is now a graduate of military boot camp and the New Dads one. He knows which he prefers.\u201cI\u2019ll take a crying baby over real boot camp any day,\u201d he said.Actually, the Boot Camp for New Dads may be one of the few programs that actually has a connection to the Marines.When the program, which is now offered nationwide, started in California in 1990, it was next to El Toro Marine Base. Marines, who were regularly a part of the class, suggested the name, said Greg Bishop, founder of Boot Camp for New Dads.It was adopted because the men weren\u2019t crazy about the original name: Bootee Camp.Email: shortcuts@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nearing a Climate Legacy", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe greenhouse gas reductions required by the Obama administration\u2019s proposed rule on power plants will not get the world to where it has to go to avert the worst consequences of climate change. But they are likely to be enormously beneficial: good for the nation\u2019s health, good for technological innovation, good for President Obama\u2019s credibility abroad, and, in time, good for the planet and future generations. The 2030 target is ambitious but hardly unattainable. Emissions from power plants have already fallen roughly 13 percent from the 2005 baseline partly because tougher rules on pollutants like mercury have forced some coal-fired plants to close or become more efficient and partly because cheap and cleaner natural gas is edging out coal as the fuel of choice among big generators. In other words, the country is almost halfway to its goal. A recent study by M.J. Bradley, a Boston consulting firm, showed that 100 of the largest power producers steadily reduced pollutants of all kinds, including carbon dioxide, between 2008 and 2012. If it withstands almost certain legal and legislative challenges, the rule also means that Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge in Copenhagen in 2009 to cut America\u2019s overall greenhouse gases by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 202o is well within reach. And it will give him leverage as he leads this country into the next round of global climate negotiations. World leaders will meet this fall in New York with an eye to producing ambitious new national emissions targets by next spring and, perhaps, a new global climate treaty by the end of 2015. Mr. Obama\u2019s credibility will be enhanced by the fact that he has begun this process on his own, in the face of a hostile Congress. After a bill imposing a price on carbon that passed the House in 2009 found no takers in the Senate, Mr. Obama decided to invoke executive powers to impose the kinds of limits that Congress had refused to entertain. Two Supreme Court rulings have said he has the authority under the Clean Air Act to do so. The issue now is how tough the new standards can be and how they are to be achieved. The rule provides industry and the states \u2014 which, by law, share responsibility for carrying out the rule \u2014 with considerable flexibility. Each state will be given a reduction target tailored to its energy mix. States will be able to decide how best to meet their targets, using an array of strategies of their choosing \u2014 deploying more renewable energy sources like wind and solar and more natural gas, ramping up energy efficiency, creating regional cap-and-trade initiatives aimed at the greatest reductions at the lowest cost. Even so, Mr. Obama and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, have been accused of a power grab, of governing by fiat, of declaring a war on coal. Jobs will indeed be lost in coal country and costs imposed on industry. But, over time, these jobs are likely to be replaced by new jobs created by the retrofitting of much of the current energy delivery system and by the expansion of alternative energy sources. And because the rule will also greatly reduce harmful toxic pollutants, the costs will be more than offset by health savings \u2014 by a ratio of as much as $7 in savings to every $1 invested in cleaner energy. So far, Mr. Obama\u2019s major environmental achievement has been a set of landmark fuel economy standards that will greatly reduce automotive carbon emissions and rested on essentially the same legal authority. This new rule is his last big chance to enlarge that legacy. Advertisement"}

He was not in uniform, but Ms. Yin knew who he was: a plainclothes police officer. He waved a hand, signaling her to pack it up.She showed the officer the city-issued license belonging to her husband. \u201cHusband come,\u201d she told the officer, using the few English words she knew. But her husband was not there. So Ms. Yin, 48, was arrested and charged with selling without a license for about the 30th time in over a decade.A selection of articles from The New York Times\u2019s archives chronicling the battle.\u201cAny rational person would think this is crazy,\u201d said Don B. Lee, who has advocated on behalf of Ms. Yin and other street vendors in Chinatown. Ms. Yin cried when she heard the news. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting years \u2014 not one or two days \u2014 14 years,\u201d she said through an interpreter.Ms. Yin\u2019s repeated run-ins with the law are an extreme example of a perennial cat-and-mouse game between the authorities and the legion of vendors who sell without official permission to do so.Selling goods without a license is a misdemeanor; officers have discretion to merely issue a summons or to make an arrest. In recent months, vendors in Chinatown selling items like 1.2-ounce bottles of liquid plant food, plastic lotus flowers, ceramic bobble-headed turtles, tube socks and red envelopes used for offerings during the celebration of the Lunar New Year, have been handcuffed, fingerprinted and taken to jail.A police spokesman declined to comment on Ms. Yin\u2019s cases, but said that 7,230 summonses were issued for unlicensed vendors in 2013. In the same year, the criminal courts processed arraignments for 1,905 arrests for selling goods without a license, according to the courts\u2019 administrative office.The day after arriving in New York from Jiangsu Province in 2000, Ms. Yin went to work helping Mr. Cheng, now 68, selling reading glasses and \u201cvery ugly\u201d clothing \u201cfor old people,\u201d she said. Mr. Cheng, who had come to New York years earlier, obtained his license in 1995. A few months after his wife joined him, Mr. Chen had a stroke. Friends told her to get a divorce, she said. Poster-size photographs of the couple in wedding white hang on the walls of their two-bedroom apartment in a public housing complex.On a good day, Ms. Yin said, she could take in $200. They get food stamps and Social Security, but her husband\u2019s medications for diabetes, Addison\u2019s disease and other ailments cost about $300 a month, she said, and her 11- and 9-year-old sons always need money for clothes and school trips. Michael, her youngest, has autism, she said, and requires therapy and tutoring.On March 14, Mr. Cheng traveled to Canal Street to join his wife at the table, which could have prevented the arrest. But, using a motorized wheelchair, he had to take the bus. Ms. Yin took the subway, and did not wait for her husband to arrive to set up.By the time Mr. Cheng arrived, the handcuffs were tight around her wrists.\u201cSo now you show up?\u201d she scolded him in Mandarin. She spent 28 hours in custody.Mr. Lee persuaded Julia Kuan, a lawyer, to represent Ms. Yin pro bono. Two weeks ago, Ms. Yin\u2019s 11 open cases were adjourned. If she does not get arrested in the next six months, the district attorney\u2019s office said, it would drop the charges. But tempting fate and further prosecution, Ms. Yin continued to sell. Last Saturday, she was sitting on a folding stool next to her table near the corner of Baxter and Canal Streets. In the shade of an umbrella, she strung a cluster of coral-like beads onto an earring hook, which she planned to sell for $8. Polyester scarves ($5 each) and hand-braided necklaces with jade beads and dragon carvings ($15 to $20 each) hung on a wire rack.\u201cI still have to take care of my family,\u201d she said.On Friday, Ms. Yin stood outside the Department of Consumer Affairs with a temporary license around her neck; it had her name and photo on it.\u201cIt means my children will no longer have to worry about their mother getting arrested,\u201d she said.A picture caption on Saturday with an article about New York City\u2019s complicated legal requirements for transferring vending licenses misstated the number of such licenses available to nonveterans. As the article correctly noted, it is 853, not 845.Jeffrey E. Singer contributed reporting and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Swearing-In, Ex-General Vows \u2018Inclusive\u2019 Egypt", "Date": "2014-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the former general who led the military takeover here nearly one year ago, was sworn in as president on Sunday, testing the bet that a new strongman can overcome the economic dysfunction and political polarization that bedeviled Egypt\u2019s three-year experiment with democracy.In an address to dozens of visiting heads of state gathered in a gilded presidential palace, Mr. Sisi pledged to work for security and stability in Egypt and the region.\u201cIt is time for our great people to reap the harvest of their two revolutions,\u201d he said, referring to the 2011 uprising that forced out President Hosni Mubarak and the 2013 protests that preceded the military takeover.Mr. Sisi, 59, now takes formal responsibility for a nation racked by three years of turmoil, scarred by the new government\u2019s bloody crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and riven by deepening loathing between rival Islamist and nationalist factions of the population. Without billions of dollars in continuing aid from Persian Gulf monarchies glad to be rid of the Brotherhood, Egypt\u2019s Treasury would empty and its economy collapse.Mr. Sisi vowed to lead an \u201cinclusive\u201d national journey, \u201cwhere each party listens to the other with impartiality, where we disagree for the sake of our homeland and not over it, where our differences are enriching and diversifying, and bestowing the spirit of cooperation and love on our shared patriotic labors.\u201dIn a televised speech at a second celebration, however, Mr. Sisi also pointedly ruled out any reconciliation with those who \u201ccommitted crimes\u201d or \u201cadopted violence as a methodology\u201d \u2014 charges understood here as a clear reference to any of the Islamist supporters of the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201cThere is no place for them in this march forward,\u201d he added. \u201cI say it loud and clear: no cooperation or appeasement for those who resort to violence and those who want to disrupt our movement to the future.\u201dMr. Sisi singled out for appreciation one foreign leader, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Sisi\u2019s chief international sponsor, whose government is donating several billion dollars to bankroll the military takeover and keep the government afloat.Mr. Sisi and the departing interim president, Adly Mansour, sitting at two gleaming writing desks, signed a document commemorating what they described as Egypt\u2019s first peaceful transition of power. But Mr. Sisi\u2019s inauguration effectively makes formal his exercise of the power he has already wielded as the nation\u2019s paramount decision maker since he deposed and jailed Mr. Morsi last July 3.Mr. Mansour, a senior judge, was named interim president by Mr. Sisi himself, so in a sense he is merely returning the chair. Shaking hands, the two men leaned in to kiss each other on the cheek.Only a few scattered protests across the country were reported on Sunday. Thousands of people in Cairo celebrated late into the night in Tahrir Square, the center of the 2011 uprising, currently surrounded by tanks and barbed wire.Mr. Sisi, who received more than 95 percent of the votes in a pro forma election last month, now holds direct responsibility for confronting challenges as formidable as any Egypt has faced in the six decades since the overthrow of the British-backed monarchy. The economy was a sieve of unaffordable fuel subsidies and rampant corruption even before the tumult of the past three years, and it has been devastated by the collapse of its vital tourism business. Since the ouster of Mr. Morsi, the military-backed government has killed more than a thousand of his Islamist supporters during street protests. It has jailed at least 16,000 others, reinforcing distrust and division.The suppression of both Islamist and liberal dissent has shut down political debate and extinguished hopes for reconciliation. Attacks on soldiers and police officers by militants seeking revenge for the ouster of Mr. Morsi have undermined public security.The inaugural ceremony on Sunday, however, suggested that Mr. Sisi was in full control of the Egyptian state, with little to fear from legislative, judicial or bureaucratic obstruction of his power \u2014 a sharp contrast to Mr. Morsi\u2019s troubled year in the presidential palace.On the eve of Mr. Morsi\u2019s victory as Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected leader in June 2012, the Supreme Constitutional Court \u2014 its members all appointed under Mr. Mubarak \u2014 abruptly dissolved the newly elected and Islamist-led Parliament on a procedural technicality. The court ordered the transfer of legislative and budgeting power to Egypt\u2019s top generals, who refused to allow the new president to be sworn in before either a crowd of citizens or an assembly of elected officials, as Mr. Morsi preferred.Instead, he was forced to stand, teeth clenched, before the judges of the same court as they lectured him about their own importance. And continuous judicial battles, police insubordination and unchecked street protests vexed his administration for the 12 months until the military takeover.Egypt\u2019s three-year experiment with democracy has ousted Hosni Mubarak and deposed Mohamed Morsi, the country\u2019s first elected leader. Explore key moments of their rule and the aftermath.Mr. Sisi, in contrast, was welcomed into the court as a national savior who had already revived Egypt at a time when \u201csome had declared it dead,\u201d as Maher Sami, the court\u2019s deputy chief, declared in a lavish tribute to the president.The new president can expect sympathy from the constitutional court in part because Mr. Mansour, his close ally, is returning to his previous role as its chief. And in his final days before leaving office, Mr. Mansour issued a law governing parliamentary elections that all but ensures that the new Parliament will be a rubber stamp for Mr. Sisi, excluding the Islamists who had dominated Egypt\u2019s free elections and minimizing the hopes of upstart liberal parties.Work crews had toiled through the weekend to beautify the area along the Nile facing the court for Mr. Sisi\u2019s arrival on Sunday morning, and two wide red carpets were draped down the court\u2019s long, neoclassical steps. (Mr. Sisi, in a blue suit and sunglasses, entered by a side door.)In his tribute before he administered the oath, Judge Sami portrayed Mr. Sisi as both heir and redeemer of the original 2011 revolt. The initial uprising against \u201ctyranny and corruption\u201d had fallen \u201ccaptive\u201d to the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 the Islamist group whose party had won the most votes in parliamentary and presidential elections \u2014 and the Brotherhood had \u201cpounced on it, decimated it and ripped it to bloody shreds just like they ripped apart the body of the whole state, just like they ripped apart the body of the entire homeland,\u201d Judge Sami said.Although the term \u201crevolution\u201d typically refers to the overturning of one legal order to establish another, Judge Sami argued that Egypt\u2019s revolution had violated the country\u2019s constitutional traditions, and thus \u201ca revolution against the revolution\u201d had become necessary.That, he said, was what happened last summer. \u201cIt was not a military coup,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the revolution of a people.\u201dAddressing Mr. Sisi as a \u201crevolutionary soldier, Egypt\u2019s devout son,\u201d Judge Sami told him, \u201cIn spite of the dangers and perils of this difficult choice, you made it for the sake of rescuing Egypt.\u201d Grateful Egyptians, the judge said, saw in Mr. Sisi \u201ca bright tomorrow and a new birth.\u201dMayy El Sheikh and May Kamel contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite High Unemployment, Portugal Looks Far Afield for Workers", "Date": "2014-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast year, the company, also known as RAC, began a nationwide recruitment campaign and hired 40 Portuguese. Half quit after the first day. By the end of the week, not a single one was left.\u201cThey wanted a job, but this wasn\u2019t what they were looking for, because it was basically too hard for too little money,\u201d said Arnulfo Murillo, the farm\u2019s production manager. \u201cFarming here isn\u2019t harder than in America, but the big difference is that being unemployed in the U.S. is a lot harder and in no way an attractive alternative.\u201dInstead, the farm has imported a third of its labor force all the way from Thailand \u2014 160 of 450 employees \u2014 a more expensive alternative, but one that has filled its ranks.The reasons the farm work does not appeal to the Portuguese are complex, but they boil down to one simple fact: It makes little economic sense. That predicament says a lot about the challenges facing the country, and much of the rest of Europe, as it struggles to gain economic traction and foster opportunities, especially for its younger generation.Window Chairat of Thailand harvesting berries at Maravilha Farms in Odemira, Portugal, this month. Reiter Affiliated Companies, the American fruit producer that owns the farm, has turned to imported labor because it cannot find enough local people to pick berries, as unemployment benefits are more appealing to many Portuguese than the meager wage offered for agricultural labor.For its agricultural sector, about 2.4 percent of the country\u2019s economic output, the problem of finding labor has been exacerbated by European Union subsidies that value high production over higher wages, the combination of Portugal\u2019s low minimum wage and still ample enough unemployment benefits, and not least, an image problem.Jos\u00e9 Alberto Guerreiro, the Socialist mayor of the municipality of Odemira where RAC\u2019s farm is, said the labor shortage was a real problem for local farms. Youths, he said, preferred to rely on summer tourism jobs or find better-paid work overseas rather than on a farm, which is \u201cvery badly considered in Portugal, as a job from the past rather than the future.\u201dIn any case, \u201cPortugal has a system of support for the unemployed that means it can be financially the same whether you work or not,\u201d Mr. Guerreiro said. \u201cYou have to understand that our young generation has been educated to expect a place in the sun \u2014 certainly not to end up doing hard manual work in the fields.\u201dLaura Miquelino, a 32-year-old from Odemira, has been unemployed for a year. Even so, she said, she would work on a farm only for higher pay. Just her monthly gas bill for the 10-mile commute to the farm would eat up a sizable portion of her pay at Portugal\u2019s minimum wage, she said.\u201cThe Portuguese state has set a minimum wage that doesn\u2019t really justify doing this kind of work, because it means you\u2019re taking almost no money home from what is a hard and very time-consuming job,\u201d said Ms. Miquelino, who previously worked in a nursery.As part of the terms of its bailout, the government almost halved the period for which unemployment benefits could be claimed to 18 months. It is now offering exemptions from social security payments to companies that hire new staff members.But those measures have not created incentive enough for many young Portuguese. European Union farming subsidies have contributed to the problem because they have reduced the pressure to restructure the farming sector and bolster its profitability, according to Catarina Santos Ferreira, a labor lawyer at ABBC, a Portuguese law firm.\u201cEuropean subsidies should have been used to restructure agricultural activities in a way that then allows farms to pay higher wages, but that has not been the case,\u201d Ms. Santos Ferreira said. \u201cWhen wages are very low and people are receiving unemployment benefits, it seems pretty normal that people prefer to get the benefit, stay home and not do a job that is very hard.\u201dRAC turned to importing labor from Asia three years ago, at the very depths of Portugal\u2019s economic crisis.Bringing over Thai workers requires visas and proof from RAC that it cannot find local workers. Recruiting a Thai picker also costs RAC almost 2,000 euros more per year than if it hired a local, as the company pays for a return airline ticket to Thailand and provides housing, where workers share rooms of four or six bunk beds.Even so, it has made economic sense for the company. The return on investment is high because the Thais work very quickly and carefully, without crushing the delicate raspberries, according to Eduardo Lopez, a Californian who heads RAC\u2019s Portuguese operations.RAC pays fruit pickers Portugal\u2019s minimum wage, equivalent to $770 per month.But it also offers a bonus system for extra production, and the Thais take full advantage. Last year, Thai workers earned a monthly gross salary of about $1,440, about $135 more than the overall average for the farm\u2019s fruit pickers.\u201cThe Thais even asked us to scrap their lunch break in order to work longer, but that\u2019s against Portuguese labor law,\u201d Mr. Lopez said. \u201cWe made real efforts to hire more locals, but it\u2019s brought a lot of disappointment.\u201dToday, just under 100 employees are Portuguese, 50 of whom pick berries. The rest are technicians or office administrators. In addition to the Thai workers, others are mostly from Eastern Europe, but also from countries like Brazil, Morocco and Nepal.Mr. Murillo, the berry farm\u2019s production manager, is Mexican but ended up in Portugal because he could get legal work here, he said, after a decade on California farms as an undocumented worker \u2014 and even once getting deported back to Mexico by the American authorities. \u201cMy experience of working in America is similar to here, in that there are no Americans who want to be in the fields of California,\u201d he said.Sunil Pun, a Nepalese fruit picker, said many Nepalese also moved to Portugal because it was relatively easy to gain working residency. Mr. Pun previously worked on a chicken farm in Poland. \u201cThe money is better in northern Europe, but the treatment is more equal here and there is less racism,\u201d he said.Echoing that view, Carlos Bernardino, a chemical engineer who is an elected member of Odemira\u2019s local assembly, said, \u201cEverybody here wants to work in public administration, but I don\u2019t know anybody who wants to say they work in agriculture.\u201dThe Thais work about eight months on the berry farm and then normally head back to Thailand during Portugal\u2019s winter break, to spend time with their families and farm rice.\u201cThais work very fast and show real respect, even if it\u2019s hard to speak with them,\u201d said Nedyalko Valkanov, a Bulgarian production supervisor on RAC\u2019s farm, who said he had learned some Thai to improve communications.Maria Gra\u00e7a Mateus Ricardo, one of the farm\u2019s Portuguese berry pickers, said she was used to working alongside foreigners but was still irked that \u201cour state gives subsidies to foreign companies to invest in Portugal, but then these companies bring workers from abroad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indications of Growth in U.S. Job Market", "Date": "2014-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsFOR more than 60 years, unemployment in the United States was largely a short-term problem. The level of unemployment went up and down, but most of the unemployed found work relatively quickly. Few remained out of work for as long as 15 weeks. Long-term unemployment was always a lesser problem.That was true from 1948, when the government began calculating the figures, until 2009. But then, as the Great Recession took hold, the level of long-term unemployment rose to levels not seen since the Great Depression.In 2009, the number of jobless workers who had been unemployed for at least 15 weeks rose above the number who had been out of work for a shorter period.Now, five years later, the long-term unemployment rate has fallen to 3.1 percent of the work force in May. That is still high by historical standards \u2014 the only times before the Great Recession that it rose that high were in 1975 and the early 1980s \u2014 but it has finally fallen below the short-term unemployment rate.The short-term rate, 3.2 percent in May, is lower than it has been during most of the last 40 years. And it is not far above the 2.9 percent figure that was reached in 2007, just before the recession began. Not since 1953 had the rate been lower than that. If long-term unemployment were now closer to historical norms, the job market would be seen as decent, if not strong.At the same time, the number of jobs that are open but unfilled rose to 4.5 million in April, the Labor Department reported this week. That was the most since 2007. There are now 2.2 unemployed people for every available job. At the worst, in 2009, there were nearly seven times as many unemployed workers as there were available jobs.In the private sector, unfilled jobs were equal to 3.7 percent of the number of jobs that were filled. That was the highest percentage since April 2007.\u201cThe fact that labor market openings seem to be building steadily,\u201d said Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management, \u201csuggests there may be something of a mismatch between demand and supply in labor markets.\u201dAt the same time, more workers are quitting their jobs, usually a sign that they either found better jobs or are confident they will be able to do so.At the worst of the Great Recession, there were far more workers being laid off or discharged than employees who quit. Now there are about four workers quitting for every three who are discharged. \u201cThe rise in the quit rate is a good sign for the economy,\u201d said Torsten Slok, the chief international economist for Deutsche Bank Securities.A chart last Saturday with the Off the Charts column, about indications of growth in the country\u2019s job market, carried an erroneous label.

{"Headline": "Assad\u2019s Win Is Assured, but Limits Are Exposed", "Date": "2014-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 As Syrians went to the polls on Tuesday in an election virtually certain to give President Bashar al-Assad a new term, buses ferried government workers from their offices to cast ballots. Security checkpoints blocked some people from leaving neighborhoods if they did not have inked fingers proving they had taken part. And a few citizens pronounced themselves so enthusiastic that they had voted several times. The ballot, which government opponents label a \u201cblood election,\u201d is Syria\u2019s first to feature more than one candidate since Mr. Assad\u2019s father rose to power in 1970. But it is taking place in a divided and ruined landscape, with no balloting in insurgent-held areas and, in government-held areas, with voters hustled to polls under watchful eyes.Mr. Assad has made clear that he will see victory as a validation of his rule and of his crackdown on the three-year insurgency. He is also sending a message that he is confident of winning the war and is unlikely to exit soon, embarrassing the United States and other international powers that have called for his ouster and sought to broker a substantive political transition. Still, there were limits to Mr. Assad\u2019s ability to stage-manage the election, which showed how far he remains from knitting the country together. Just blocks from central Damascus neighborhoods festooned with posters of the president, where joy-riding young people waved government flags from cars and polling stations seemed to occupy every school and government building, the long-restive outlying districts and suburbs amounted to another world. Among the bombed-out apartment blocks of the northern districts of Barzeh and Qaboun, there were no official flags, no cheering crowds and no elections. Grocers sipping tea had switched off the triumphal election coverage on state channels, listening instead to the continued shelling of insurgent-held areas nearby. Mazen, 40, a fighter in Qaboun, summed it up this way: \u201cBashar al-Assad is not our president.\u201d The government has cited recent truces in Barzeh and other areas that were long blockaded and starved by security forces as signs of healing and rebuilding in the country. But even after spending considerable political capital negotiating truces with insurgents in a half-dozen towns ringing the capital \u2014 angering some core government supporters \u2014 officials appeared to have been unable to persuade fighters in those areas to allow voting. Many voters, though, expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Assad, and declared the elections a victory over an insurgency they saw as driven by a foreign conspiracy. Razan Mohammad, 35, an employee of Syriatel, the cellphone company owned by the president\u2019s powerful cousin Rami Makhlouf, called Mr. Assad \u201cthe only guarantee for Syria to hold together\u201d against what she called extremist Islamist fighters backed by Israel and the West. \u201cAll the barking dogs are outside of Syria, watching our joy and happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cBashar is the best and the strongest.\u201dAbu Ali, 55, interviewed in downtown Damascus, was walking with his 12-year-old son from one polling place to another. \u201cI voted five times,\u201d he said. \u201cEven my son voted.\u201dStreets and shops were closed and security was tight. Government warplanes whooshed over the city.A day earlier, some insurgent groups declared that anyone not staying home would be a target. But\u00a0on Tuesday, major groups, including the Islamic Front and the Army of Islam, said in a statement that they would hold their fire to avoid making things \u201cworse for our people\u201d who were being \u201cled to the election by force.\u201d Still, by day\u2019s end, several dozen mortar rounds had landed in the city, and a shell killed at least one person in the suburb of Jaramana. Mr. Assad\u2019s international opponents have branded the election a farce. Election observers were on hand\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0from North Korea \u2014 a country even less tolerant of dissent than Syria \u2014 as well as from Mr. Assad\u2019s allies Iran and Russia, along with Brazil, Zimbabwe and others. It remains to be seen if Mr. Assad, after claiming a new term, can or will fulfill pledges to end the war and rebuild the shattered country. For some opponents of the government, it was time to take stock. Several civilian activists in neighboring Lebanon said it was time to stop encouraging false hopes, and to urge fellow Syrians to \u201carrange their lives\u201d assuming Mr. Assad would stay. One said she planned to carry a sign through Beirut reading, \u201cWe lost and Assad won.\u201d\u201cAnyone who talks to me about resistance and continuing the revolution, I will punch him in the face,\u201d she said, asking not to be named because the Syrian government exercises strong influence in Lebanon.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from the Syrian-Lebanese border, Mohammad Ghannam from Beirut, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.Advertisement"}

Even as they grumbled about the cost, Germans provided crucial support to the euro union when it seemed in danger of collapse in recent years \u2014 seeing their country\u2019s relatively robust economy as a prime beneficiary of the euro system.But Mr. Henkel and the upstart party he represents have already shaken up German politics, becoming a serious irritant to Chancellor Angela Merkel and even complicating her relations with Britain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron.No wonder Mr. Henkel was exuberant one day last week as he waited in a cafeteria line at the European Parliament, where he formally takes office next month.\u201cMerkel is terrified of us,\u201d Mr. Henkel said.A few minutes later, over a cappuccino, he explained his journey from euro enthusiast to currency contrarian.\u201cA country is responsible for its own debts and the stability of its own banks,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to save the euro they have pushed this overboard. That disturbs me.\u201dMr. Henkel\u2019s desire to scuttle the euro is not shared by most business executives, particularly in Germany.\u201cThe introduction of the euro was and remains the right thing,\u201d said Ulrich Grillo, president of the Federation of German Industries, a group that Mr. Henkel led from 1995 to 2000. \u201cEspecially for Germany and its export economy,\u201d Mr. Grillo said in an email exchange, \u201cthe common currency is the foundation of prosperity and employment.\u201dMr. Henkel is a rarity in Germany, where there is almost no tradition of business leaders entering politics.He financed his own successful run for office, in the mode of many American politicians. Mr. Henkel contributed 1 million euros, or $1.36 million, to his party, the Alternative for Germany, which proved crucial to its winning 7 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections last month and seven seats in the European Parliament.The party\u2019s delegation is tiny in an assembly with 751 members. But Mr. Henkel was part of a wave of discontent that delivered unprecedented power to euro-skeptic parties in Brussels, posing a political threat to the currency union even as euro zone leaders were dealing with financial and economic threats that nearly destroyed it.With echoes of the Tea Party in the United States, Mr. Henkel and a small army of other newly elected members want to curtail what they see as the overarching power of the European Union and abolish the euro, or at least expel members like Greece and Italy, which they regard as chronically irresponsible.With his blue-chip business r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and name recognition earned from years on the German television talk show circuit, Mr. Henkel symbolizes how the anti-euro movement is becoming more socially acceptable \u2014 and more difficult for the centrist, pro-euro parties to ignore.At the same time, though, his particular variety of Brussels bashing is a reminder of how difficult it will be for the euro-skeptic parties to reconcile their eclectic platforms. Although many of the groups share a hostility toward the European Union, they also often foster distinct elements of nationalism and xenophobia, making it a challenge to find common cause on any issue of substance.Mr. Henkel, a longtime member of the human rights group Amnesty International, strenuously denies that the Alternative for Germany party, known as the AfD in Germany, is a haven for the extreme right. He says such labels come from journalists who \u201cwould rather paint us into an anti-immigration corner or a rightist corner so they can ignore us.\u201dHe ruled out cooperating with far-right, anti-immigration groups like the Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front in France or the U.K. Independence Party, led by Nigel Farage.Instead, the AfD joined the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, or E.C.R. The E.C.R. also includes members of the British Conservative Party, whose decision to welcome the AfD last week strained already uneasy relations between Ms. Merkel and Mr. Cameron, the Conservative leader. (Britain, of course, has long opposed the euro union, having opted to stick with the pound sterling.)But membership in the E.C.R. is not likely to quiet criticism that the AfD, led by Bernd Lucke, an economics professor at the University of Hamburg, is a Trojan horse for Germany\u2019s extreme right. The E.C.R. also includes right-wing populist parties like the True Finns of Finland and the Danish People\u2019s Party.Manfred G\u00fcllner, head of the Forsa polling firm in Berlin, pointed out that in the May elections for the European Parliament, the AfD did especially well in voting districts seen as bastions of far-right sympathy, such as a region in southeastern Germany known as Saxon Switzerland. While Mr. Henkel helps lend the party an air of respectability, Mr. G\u00fcllner said, \u201cin my eyes it\u2019s almost an extreme-right party.\u201dStill, Mr. Henkel may make it harder to stereotype anti-euro forces in the European Parliament as a collection of right-wing cranks. The AfD has clearly stolen votes from Ms. Merkel\u2019s centrist Christian Democrats.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to have a political party from Germany composed of people with reputations like Mr. Henkel,\u201d Jan Zahradil, a Czech member of the European Parliament who is first vice chairman of the E.C.R., said by telephone after the group voted to include the AfD. \u201cHe really is an asset.\u201dBefore he ran for office, Mr. Henkel was already well known as an advocate for loosening Germany\u2019s rigid work rules. His rage at what he derides as heavy-handed government practices was nurtured at IBM, where he worked for more than three decades.Mr. Henkel recalled last week how, as head of IBM\u2019s German operations in the late 1980s, he ran into ferocious opposition from unions, political leaders and even the Catholic Church when he tried to operate a semiconductor factory near Stuttgart on Sundays.Mr. Henkel went on to become head of IBM\u2019s operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, but left in 1995. He then became the unpaid president of the Federation of German Industries.After leaving the federation in 2000, Mr. Henkel emerged as something of a professional contrarian, appearing often on talk shows as an advocate of rolling back Germany\u2019s social welfare system.Later, he was a board member of mainstream companies like Bayer, the German drug and chemical maker, and an adviser to Bank of America. He resigned from those posts before entering politics.Although Mr. Henkel said he had private doubts about the euro from the outset, he publicly supported the idea as the currency was being introduced in 1999. He turned decisively against it, he said, after Ms. Merkel agreed in 2010 to a rescue plan for Greece \u2014 which Mr. Henkel still dismisses as nothing more than a handout to French banks with Greek holdings.The AfD\u2019s goal, he said, is to repeat its recent success in several coming German state elections, and then, led by Bernd Lucke, ride the momentum to representation in the German Bundestag in 2017.\u201cThen I will leave politics,\u201d Mr. Henkel said. \u201cIt is my ultimate goal to see Mr. Lucke give speeches in the Bundestag.\u201dAs he finished his cappuccino, Mr. Henkel maintained that an increasing number of his business peers privately shared his doubts about the euro. He likened his quest now to the 1980s and 1990s, when he was a voice in the wilderness pleading for less government interference in business.\u201cI was alone then,\u201d he said, \u201cand I find myself again alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Electricity Reporting for Duty", "Date": "2014-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHandlebarsThe 2014 Zero SR.The Zero SR is a promising indicator that the ever-more-capable electric motorcycles introduced in recent years are closing in on daily-use practicality.The premise is tempting: the fun and freedom of riding a conventional motorcycle, but with the silent power, save-the-world vibe and pennies-per-mile economy of an E.V. The Zero SR is a pumped-up version of the California company\u2019s commuter-oriented Zero S; it uses a new high-amperage controller that lets the same motor and battery system deliver considerably more power, albeit for short bursts. The result is an impressive 106 pound-feet of torque, more than a 103-cubic-inch Harley-Davidson Street Glide. The Zero SR that I tested had the optional Power Tank battery ($2,495, 2.8 kilowatt-hours) mounted under a faux fuel tank, for a total of 14.2 kilowatt-hours of energy capacity \u2014 almost as much as the battery pack in the Chevy Volt, which is rated at 16.5 kilowatt-hours.\u00a0That\u2019s enough, according to Zero\u2019s specifications, for a range of 171 miles in city use, based on an E.P.A. urban driving cycle. But that must be a city where the lights stay green, there\u2019s a constant tailwind and all the streets lead downhill. In a mix of calm city cruising and impatient cornering, my range varied from 85 to 95 miles \u2014 adequate for almost any commute and sufficient for a romp in the hills on a weekend morning.Three programmed riding modes are available. Performance in the Eco setting reminded me of my 2012 Toyota Prius Plug-In; riders should switch into Sport mode before trying a last-second burst into a traffic gap. A Custom mode lets you program your own power-delivery settings using a smartphone. In Sport mode, the SR responds briskly from a standing start and just gets faster. The power curve has been tailored to keep the front wheel on the ground, so it takes a few ticks to gather steam. But from 30 to 70 m.p.h. \u2014 the kind of acceleration you do in moving traffic or from corner to corner on a twisty road \u2014 the SR is genuinely quick. That\u2019s wonderful fun, though the festivities don\u2019t last. After a minute or two of enthusiastic riding the air-cooled motor nears its temperature limit, and the power tapers off. Slowing for a few miles restores full power, but knowing that there are only a few long wide-open bursts in every heat cycle puts a damper on the party. The Zero SR, like the lower-price Zero S, is configured as a sit-up urban commuter bike with a wide handlebar. The frame structure is stiff, the steering is precise, and the suspension is well-sorted. But this is no lightweight: With the Power Tank added, the SR weighs 452 pounds. The excellent chassis makes it feel lighter, though the weight becomes evident under hard braking. A little harder pull on the brake lever and you\u2019re good. The SR is an excellent day-in, day-out commuter. Its instant power and direct single-speed drive make it easy to exploit gaps in traffic. One problem: The thick frame and stout upper fork tubes limit the steering angle so much that parking or wiggling around stopped cars is awkward. The standard 110-volt power cord and 1.3-kilowatt onboard charger needed nearly 11 hours to completely recharge the 14.2 kilowatt-hour battery pack. With a $300 charging adapter it\u2019s possible to top up at a 220-volt Level 2 recharging station, but that does not shorten the process. Zero offers a $600 Quick Charger that can speed things by 40 percent or so, and it\u2019s possible to gang as many as four Quick Chargers together to charge even faster. But that\u2019s a lot of trouble, expense and wires to trip over. If you know where you\u2019re going, ride fewer than 80 miles a day and can charge all night, you\u2019ll be fine. Even with tax incentives, the Zero SR is expensive. But so are many other motorcycles that do the same essential job, but do it in a noisier, messier and less-sustainable way. Advertisement"}

Are opponents of this plan saying we can no longer solve large and intractable problems that will affect human and nonhuman life for generations to come?Many of us concerned about the environment do not believe that and are confident that with concerted effort, we can find a way to be the world leader in protecting and preserving our environment while growing our economy. Although the U.S. Chamber of Commerce believes that a potential 0.3 percent decrease in the gross domestic product is too high a cost to pay to protect planet Earth, what will its members be willing to pay to ameliorate the environmental destruction that we are already witnessing?We need to stand on the shoulders of all who came before us who have achieved great things against long odds.To the Editor:As a resident of Indiana, a coal state, I applaud the Obama administration\u2019s proposed regulations to cut carbon pollution from power plants, and I am frustrated that even Indiana\u2019s Democratic senator, Joe Donnelly, wrote to the president to urge that he reconsider the proposal.When it comes to climate change, no state is an island, free to continue its carbon pollution. As an agricultural state, Indiana will suffer reduced yields of corn and soybeans as a result of climate change. As an industrial state, it must shift to clean and efficient energy. The longer it delays, the greater its vulnerability to drastic change in a climate catastrophe.Coal-state officials should join Jim Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, Ind., and take the lead in climate-friendly adaptation, attracting new industries and good jobs. They should also support a carbon fee and dividend, putting a realistic price on carbon and spurring clean energy and smart conservation.To the Editor:For every offset awarded under California\u2019s cap-and-trade system to a rural dairy in Wisconsin, there is pollution allowed that would have been required to be reduced by the ultimate offset purchaser. And that purchaser is often a California refinery in an urban area near thousands of people disproportionately low-income and of color.California seems to assume in the case of dairies that they would have never installed methane capture even though there is money to be made from generating electricity and ample supportive federal programs.At best, cap-and-trade as practiced in California can lead to environmental injustice; at worst, emission reductions are a mirage, as they would have happened anyway.

It is exciting to see how much experimentation is going on, and when we find something that works, we should expand it.But we shouldn\u2019t overlook the value of an option that exists right now in every home, in every business, in every government building: energy efficiency. Investment in energy efficiency is the single most cost-effective way to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that we continue to pump into the atmosphere. Energy efficiency also lowers energy bills, and those savings can be reinvested to grow jobs and profits. We have not even come close to exploiting all the opportunities that exist to reduce our energy waste today.Weatherization, LED lighting upgrades and high-efficiency air-conditioners may not sound sexy, but to the climate, they are a veritable Brad Pitt.

{"Headline": "Conflicting Gestures From Putin to Ukraine Leaders", "Date": "2014-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia proffered both a carrot and a stick to Ukraine on Saturday, issuing a qualified acceptance of a peace plan proposed by the Ukrainian leadership to quell a separatist uprising in the southeast, but simultaneously putting troops across central Russia on combat alert and mounting surprise military drills.A statement posted late Saturday on the Kremlin\u2019s website was Mr. Putin\u2019s most direct call to date for a cease-fire. Moscow has previously insisted that it does not hold sufficient sway over the pro-Russian separatists to influence their position.\u201cThe president of Russia calls on all parties to the conflict to cease hostilities and sit down at the negotiating table,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Putin also described as \u201cunacceptable\u201d the firing of Ukrainian shells into a Russian border post on Friday night, soon after the cease-fire was declared, \u201ccausing material damage and threatening the life and health of Russian citizens.\u201dThe loudest response to that episode came hours before Mr. Putin\u2019s statement, when the Russian defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, announced that about 65,000 troops across central Russia would begin a week of combat drills.In Ukraine, Mr. Poroshenko addressed the nation on Saturday, laying out the details of his 15-point peace plan and speaking as if the military fight was over. The 12-minute speech emphasized the need for negotiations, addressing the main Russian criticism. \u201cI am ready for dialogue with those who made a mistake, having mistakenly supported the position of separatism,\u201d he said, adding \u201cexcept, of course, those who are complicit in terrorist actions, murders and torture.\u201dHe left at least a partial window for talks with some of the separatists who have not taken up arms. But the separatist political leaders have said they would only talk to Kiev via intermediaries. So the crux of the problem remains that the two sides that most need to hammer out a compromise refuse to meet. It appeared unlikely that the differences over who would participate could be bridged quickly. Russia\u2019s dual-track approach reflected what analysts have been saying for weeks is Russia\u2019s main goal: to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to grant significant autonomy to the southeast without prompting a third round of Western sanctions. Western leaders are set to consult on further sanctions this week.But it also reflected the split within the Russian government. The military and nationalists pushed Mr. Putin to annex the autonomous Ukrainian region of Crimea in March and generally want Russia to reclaim its role as a global power and an antidote to the West. More liberal economists, business moguls and diplomats, recognizing that Russia is now integrated into the world economy in a way it never was during the Soviet era, want to prevent even worse fallout than that caused by Crimea\u2019s annexation.\u201cI think that they will keep agreeing to cease-fires, keep calling on the militants to stop the fighting and keep supplying the militants with arms until they achieve a stable equilibrium on their terms,\u201d said Clifford Kupchan, a Washington-based Russia analyst at the Eurasia Group.Analysts believe that Russia is looking, eventually, for a compact. But it wants sufficient influence in southeastern Ukraine to destabilize the Kiev government or to make sure that it does not get too close to the European Union or contemplate joining NATO.Analysts point out that there is insufficient trust on either side to negotiate, and that the fighting might slip out of the leaders\u2019 control. \u201cEach side is escalating, hoping the other side will blink, but in the process it is getting harder and harder for any kind of meaningful agreement to be reached,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russia\u2019s security forces at New York University. Mr. Putin emphasized the need for such an agreement in his announcement. \u201cThe opportunity that opens up with the end of hostilities should be used to start constructive negotiations and to reach a political compromise between the parties to the conflict in southeast Ukraine,\u201d his statement said.In May, Mr. Putin had suggested that the rebels not hold a referendum on separating from Ukraine, but they ignored his call. Mr. Poroshenko declared the cease-fire as he introduced a 15-point peace plan that would establish a six-mile demilitarized zone along the Ukrainian-Russian border and provide an escape corridor for Russian and Ukrainian mercenaries who the Ukrainian government has said are involved in the fighting. It suggested the regions would be granted autonomy, a key Russian demand, although critics said it did not go far enough.Military and political leaders of the self-declared people\u2019s republics in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine on Saturday rejected laying down their arms.Alexander Borodai, the Russian prime minister of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, said \u201cthere is no cease-fire\u201d and called for peacekeepers from Russia to enter the country to prevent \u201ca humanitarian catastrophe.\u201d\u201cHow can I comment on a plan that is only a fantasy?\u201d Mr. Borodai said when asked if he was aware of the peace plan. Andrew Roth contributed reporting from Donetsk, Ukraine.Advertisement"}

The S.&P. 500 is now up 6.2 percent for the year, while the Dow is up 2.2 percent. The major stock indexes all finished ahead for the week.Despite the record-setting closes, it was largely a static day for the stock indexes and a light day for economic data. Investors seemed mostly to focus on companies in the news, like CarMax, Oracle and Darden Restaurants. They also kept an eye on the developing conflict in Iraq, which pushed oil prices near a nine-month high. \u201cGenerally speaking, any big movements will come when we start earnings season in a couple of weeks,\u201d said Drew Wilson, equity analyst with Fenimore Asset Management. \u201cUntil then, it\u2019ll be hand-to-hand combat in the indexes.\u201dThe S.&P. 500, Dow and Nasdaq composite started off in the green during premarket trading and remained mostly higher all day. By the last hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was on track for a record close. More than half of the 30 companies in the index rose, raising the possibility that the Dow might breach the 17,000 mark soon.\u201cIf the economy continues to grow the way it\u2019s growing and the Federal Reserve remains as supportive as it is, I think we have more highs to achieve before the year is out,\u201d said Krishna Memani, chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds.

{"Headline": "What to Consider When Looking for the Right Place to Retire", "Date": "2014-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringModels of pre-retirement planning, Don and Reina Weiner bought an acre of land almost a decade ago in the Woodlands of Chapel Hill, a mixed-age community in North Carolina.The couple, living in Leesburg, Va., at the time, had visited several towns around the country in their hunt to find a place to live when Mr. Weiner was ready to leave his job as senior sales director at Airbus Americas. Chapel Hill met their three criteria: warm weather, access to top medical care and proximity to a university to continue learning, Mrs. Weiner said.So they paid $130,000 for a lot and $11,000 to an architect to design their dream home. They sold their townhouse in Leesburg and rented an apartment in Chapel Hill so they could supervise construction.That\u2019s when Mr. Weiner, now 68, and Mrs. Weiner, 67, hit a barricade. \u201cI had a significant allergic reaction to the environment,\u201d Mrs. Weiner said. She felt an intense pressure in her head. Her throat hurt. There was sinus pain. \u201cThe question was, Could I live here?\u201d she said.They decided to hold off breaking ground on the home while she tried to see if she could acclimate to the area. But she had an epiphany: \u201cI decided you know what, this is crazy, I\u2019m trying to do something that I can\u2019t do.\u201d So they regretfully put up the \u2018for sale\u2019 sign on the lot, and are back in the search for a place to live.\u201cThe whole experience was disappointing,\u201d Mrs. Weiner said. \u201cThere was money that just went flying out the door. On the other hand, when I decided I couldn\u2019t do it, I just felt it was the right thing to do. I haven\u2019t looked back.\u201dAs people grapple with whether to pull up stakes and retire in another part of the country, there\u2019s small margin for error. Get it wrong, and it\u2019s hard and costly to undo.Almost one-third of those canvassed plan to spend retirement in a different state from the one in which they currently live.Deciding where to move entails some careful planning, perhaps compromising with a partner, and setting priorities. \u201cNo place is perfect,\u201d Mrs. Weiner said.The five best states for retirement were South Dakota, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota and Wyoming. Popular retiree spots like Florida and Arizona don\u2019t even make the top 10. The five worst states for retirement, according to the report, were New York, West Virginia, Alaska, Arkansas and Hawaii.A shrewd relocation choice can reinforce a financial plan for living the longer and healthier life that baby boomers are expecting.One big reward of relocating to a smaller home, or one where the real estate market is more affordable, is taking advantage of the equity built up in the home that\u2019s left behind and paying cash for the new place.If the timing is right, there\u2019s cash left over to reduce or eliminate credit card and other consumer debts.Moving from a high-tax state to a low-tax state is also strategic. Many people pick a retirement destination because there\u2019s no income tax. \u201cWhile income tax considerations in choosing a place to retire are important, accounting for other forms of state and local taxes that are imposed in the new locale is a necessary step prior to the move,\u201d said Jamie C. Yesnowitz, state and local tax principal at Grant Thornton in Washington.Florida, for example, imposes no income tax but has sales and property taxes that may be significant. State and local sales taxes vary greatly, with some at 7 percent or more. Five states \u2014 Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon \u2014 have no state-level sales tax.Property taxes are generally the biggest tax burden for homeowning retirees. According to the Tax Foundation, states with relatively low per capita real estate tax collections include Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Oklahoma, while those with high per capita real estate tax collections include Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Wyoming.Most states give breaks to residents over a certain age, and there may be property tax credits or homestead exemptions that limit the value of assessed property subject to tax. But it\u2019s usually in the hands of a local assessor to determine the total taxable value.Review the total tax picture of each of your possible destinations as part of a balanced assessment of the optimal place to live, Mr. Yesnowitz advised.College towns in particular are attractive places to live and work in retirement. They tend to have entertainment and sports locales and offer a range of part-time and seasonal jobs because these communities tend to be recession-resistant.Each year, a new class of students moves into the area, which keeps the economy in gear. Plus, many towns are situated in regions with leading health care centers that are also a source of jobs for experienced workers.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a college town close \u2014 you get some sports and some theater,\u201d said Mrs. Parsons.It has been a lifestyle change for the couple, though. In Lincoln Park, they could walk to the Steppenwolf Theater and to dozens of restaurants. They could walk to Whole Foods. There was an Apple Store down the street. \u201cHere, I have to drive 12 miles if I run out of toilet paper,\u201d Mrs. Parsons said.The Parsons tested the waters before they packed their moving truck. They bought the property in 2008 and used it as a vacation house for a few years. \u201cThe year before we actually moved down here, we took a two-week vacation here because I wanted to see what it would be like to live in the area,\u201d she said.One niggling drawback. \u201cI miss the ability to fly nonstop anywhere in the world,\u201d she said. The tiny Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport is about a 45-minute drive away, but unlike O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago, most destinations require a connection.In addition to access to a good airport, before buying a retirement home, soon-to-be retirees and retirees should consider what their daily transportation needs will be when they are in their 70s and 80s.That\u2019s one reason the Weiners are now considering Portland, Ore., in addition to Charlotte and Asheville, N.C. \u201cDon hates traffic, and there is a great light rail system\u201d in Portland, Mrs. Weiner said. \u201cPlus, our daughter, Laura, is living there now.\u201dWhat about the warm weather she said was a priority when they first started looking for a retirement home? \u201cI figure we could always leave for a couple months in the winter and rent a furnished apartment in Maui,\u201d she said with a smile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama, Seeking Unity on Russia, Meets Obstacles", "Date": "2014-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 President Obama started his day in Warsaw struggling to convince his friends in Central and Eastern Europe that the United States is being tough enough with Russia. He ended his day in Brussels, still struggling, but this time to persuade America\u2019s core Western allies to stay tough with Russia.The dizzying contrasts underscored the challenges Mr. Obama faces navigating the complicated waters of European politics as he tries to forge a unified stance against Russian aggression in Ukraine. On the defensive at home for a prisoner swap, he finds himself pressed overseas by some allies unsatisfied with his reassurances of resolve and others unimpressed with his arguments for action.He arrived here on Wednesday to have dinner with the leaders of the Group of 7 powers who, at his urging, had excluded President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as punishment for his annexation of Crimea. But Mr. Obama\u2019s counterparts from Britain, France and Germany all ended up scheduling one-on-one meetings with Mr. Putin later on. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France even arranged to have dinner with Mr. Putin on Thursday just after having a separate dinner with Mr. Obama.Not only were they unwilling to snub the Russian leader entirely, as Mr. Obama sought, they were also reluctant to go along with other efforts to isolate the Kremlin. Most notably, the French government repeated that it would go ahead with the $1.6 billion sale of powerful warships to Moscow along with plans to train 400 Russian sailors in France this month. And other European leaders were cautious about setting further red lines threatening additional sanctions against Russia.Mr. Obama\u2019s aides repeated their opposition to the French sale on Wednesday but tried to play down the disparate approaches of the leaders. \u201cThe question is not whether they\u2019re meeting,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president\u2019s deputy national security adviser. \u201cThe question is what people are saying in those meetings. And our belief is that there needs to be a unified message.\u201dOthers expressed concern. Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister who saw Mr. Obama in Warsaw and then traveled to Kiev later in the day, said Moscow was playing the allies against one another.\u201cI really hope the G-7 dinner tonight has produced the cohesion necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only by sticking together that we can influence events. Russia is very consciously cultivating and using different bilateral links.\u201dThe leaders used their dinner on Wednesday to discuss what might set off another, more expansive round of sanctions. Some Europeans want to keep new sanctions in their pocket, as they put it, to impose only if Russia escalates the situation, while others say Moscow should avoid new penalties only if it proactively works to stop pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine.After a long discussion, the leaders left the question largely unresolved. In a joint statement, they again condemned Russia\u2019s actions and called on the country to stop the flow of arms and fighters across its borders. But they did not specify what might prompt them to broaden their sanctions to target entire sectors of the Russian economy. Instead, they threatened \u201cto impose further costs on Russia should events so require,\u201d without elaboration.Unlike some other Western European leaders, Chancellor Angela Merkel sided with the tougher line in a speech to the German Parliament before flying to Brussels. Mr. Putin \u201chas to make his influence felt\u201d with pro-Russian separatists who have attacked and seized government offices in eastern Ukraine and do more to prevent weapons flowing into Ukraine across porous Russian borders, she said.\u201cIf all this does not stop,\u201d she told Parliament, \u201cthen we will not shy away from imposing new sanctions.\u201dBut the French government repeated its refusal to cancel the warship sale, saying it would be illegal to break a contract under international law. French officials view the economic imperative as outweighing the geopolitical costs.\u201cFrance cannot bat aside these economic questions with the back of a hand,\u201d said Jean-Louis Carr\u00e8re, who leads the French Senate\u2019s committee on foreign relations and defense, noting \u201cthe serious economic difficulties\u201d the country is facing.They also disagreed with Mr. Obama\u2019s strategy of walling off Moscow from the outside world. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried not to isolate Russia,\u201d said a French official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate a diplomatic dispute. \u201cHow can you ignore Russia today? They are important actors in the Middle East. They are everywhere.\u201dThat Mr. Obama is caught in the middle may be frustrating to him, given that he does not seem eager for a confrontation with the Kremlin either, but he wants to avoid allowing Russian aggression to stand with impunity and feels pressure at home to take a tough line. Even within his team, there are cross pressures about how to respond, most recently over sending more troops to bolster the security of Poland and other NATO allies in the east.Mr. Obama sided with aides who advised against a more robust military presence in the east in the short term for fear that it would be unnecessarily provocative. But he did promise to spend up to $1 billion if approved by Congress to increase joint exercises, expand military training and preposition equipment. And in a speech in Castle Square in Warsaw on Wednesday before flying here, he had strong words of support.\u201cPoland will never stand alone,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cEstonia will never stand alone. Latvia will never stand alone. Lithuania will never stand alone. Romania will never stand alone.\u201dMr. Obama was addressing a ceremony for the 25th anniversary of the elections that led to the eventual collapse of Communist rule in Poland, and he linked those stirring events to the current upheaval in Ukraine. \u201cThe Ukrainians of today are the heirs of Solidarity \u2014 men and women like you who dared to challenge a bankrupt regime,\u201dhe said.His message drew mixed reactions. \u201cThe U.S. president did not miss the opportunity to say the right things in the right time and place,\u201d said Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, a former Polish prime minister.But Witold Waszczykowski, a senior member of Poland\u2019s chief opposition party, Law and Justice, said that $1 billion for a region of 10 allies was not much. \u201cIn the past 25 years, we heard a lot of nice speeches, also from other American presidents,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to turn words into deeds. Because it\u2019s us who are neighbors with the greatest aggressor.\u201dMr. Obama met in Warsaw for the first time with the newly elected president of Ukraine, Petro O. Poroshenko, and pledged support for efforts to stabilize his country. Mr. Obama announced that the United States would provide Ukraine with $5 million worth of night-vision goggles, body armor and communications equipment long sought by its security forces.Secretary of State John Kerry also spent time talking with Mr. Poroshenko, privately urging him to provide evidence of Russian involvement with separatists with which to confront Russian officials. He plans to meet with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov in Paris on Thursday.Mr. Obama praised Mr. Poroshenko. \u201cI have been deeply impressed by his vision,\u201d he said after their 70-minute session. \u201cThe United States is absolutely committed to standing behind the Ukrainian people and their aspirations, not just in the coming days and weeks but in the coming years.\u201dReporting was contributed by Rick Lyman from Warsaw, Alison Smale from Berlin and Alissa Rubin and Steven Erlanger from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Food Networks", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo start a food trend from agriculture is \u201cone of the riskiest\u201d things an entrepreneur can do, David Sax writes in \u201cThe Tastemakers,\u201d his entertaining new excursion into, as his subtitle has it, \u201cWhy We\u2019re Crazy for Cupcakes but Fed Up With Fondue.\u201d \u201cYet every day,\u201d he adds, \u201cthere are countless farmers, scientists and gardening dreamers with a trowel in their hand, digging in the dirt and planting the seed that they hope will one day change the way we eat.\u201dSax could well be describing Dan Barber, the nationally prominent chef whose Blue Hill restaurants, one in Greenwich Village and the other in Westchester County, have knit farming practices into daily menus in a way few other high-profile farm-to-table restaurants have been able to manage. In articles, TED talks and at conferences, Barber has established himself as one of the food world\u2019s leading voices on how farm practices influence flavor. And now he establishes himself as one of the food world\u2019s leading writers.\u201cThe Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food\u201d is a combination travel diary, history of farm practice, statement of agricultural and culinary philosophy, and frank, opinionated chef memoir. It also presents a good picture of where what\u2019s loosely called \u201cthe food movement\u201d is now, and where it might fruitfully be taken in years to come. In his introduction, Barber describes an exercise in which, at the request of a food magazine marking its 35th anniversary, he was asked to imagine the way we\u2019ll be eating 35 years from now. If 35 years ago our dining \u2014 in what he calls the \u201cfirst plate\u201d \u2014 was meat-centric, he decides that what we\u2019re eating now, the \u201csecond plate,\u201d is vegetable- and farm-centric. But what will that future \u201cthird plate\u201d look and taste like?Despite the opaque title, Barber\u2019s book is really a chronicle of experiments in how to change flavor through planting and harvesting techniques \u2014 and only then through cooking. Barber is endlessly in-your-face inquisitive, always looking for something more delicious. And he\u2019s generally dissatisfied. (Like pretty much anyone who writes and thinks about food, I\u2019ve spent hours listening to \u2014 and arguing \u2014 with him.)The seed Barber hopes will change the way people eat is a cross of wheat varieties that will grow well in the Northeast and offer the kind of flavor long lost to industrialized farming and milling. He comes to see this need in the kitchen of Mary-Howell and Klaas Martens, two farmers in upstate New York whose abandonment of conventional farming and subsequent ability to raise superbly flavorful organic food inspire many of his travels and practices. One day Mary-Howell serves him a rhubarb cake made with whole wheat flour she milled that morning, in which \u201ceach bite of cake brought a whiff of wheat, . . . and it made a prosaic dessert richly textured and interesting.\u201dBarber decides he wants his own wheat, and his search for the right new-old cross frames the rest of his book. Before we can see or taste Barber wheat, though, we follow him on visits to growers, scientists and chefs across the country, and especially across the Atlantic, where his friend and muse, the journalist Lisa Abend (the author of \u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentices,\u201d a wickedly well-observed account of a year in the kitchens of Ferran Adri\u00e0's El Bulli), leads him to Spanish farmers and cooks whose relationship with the high plains of Extremadura Barber hopes to replicate in New York.Barber has an ear for dialogue and an eye for people\u2019s quirks, as well as a quality not always apparent in the heat of the kitchen \u2014 a sense of humor about his own impatience and bluntness, which he excuses as a chef\u2019s necessary trait. He also reveals an easy erudition, dropping in a reference to Balzac\u2019s hand trembling \u201cwith pleasure on seeing a pyramid of pears or beautiful peaches\u201d and frequently quoting founding fathers of the organic movement like Rudolf Steiner, William Albrecht and Aldo Leopold. In addition, he introduces his readers to the voices of today\u2019s heroes: Joan Dye Gussow, Wes Jackson, Eliot Coleman and Wendell Berry. Since Barber thinks like a chef who wants to keep a jump ahead of his rivals, we also get some inside-chef gossip, like the story of the hot-tempered Frenchman Michel Rostang, brought to bay during a screaming outburst by the appearance of a perfect leg of jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico, which he strokes as if it were a newborn.The last section of Barber\u2019s book, \u201cSeed,\u201d is the most valuable, and gets us back to that wheat. Here he writes about teaching himself the scientific background and gives us easy-to-grasp descriptions of conventional breeding techniques. He writes about growing vegetables and grains for their flavor and utility to cooks as well as for hardiness, and he puts to rest some foodie myths, like the one that only old varieties actually taste good. Heirloom food may be what we think of as the gold standard, grown before the era of industrial farming, but heirlooms are frozen in time and thus frequently unsuited to current soil and climate conditions.By the end of \u201cThe Third Plate,\u201d Barber recognizes that \u201cmy hope that Barber wheat would become the most desired in the world suddenly felt na\u00efve.\u201d No such humility troubles most of the dreamers and entrepreneurs in \u201cThe Tastemakers,\u201d David Sax\u2019s romp through the world of chefs, farmers, bloggers, market researchers, television producers and advertisers who drive us to want, need, crave and murderously desire something like a Cronut. After, that is, we\u2019ve had our fill of cupcakes, which apparently we never will.Sax documents the rise and rise of cupcakes in an opening chapter that traces their evolution \u2014 or, perhaps better, devolution \u2014 from bit player in a scene in \u201cSex and the City\u201d to starring role in blogs and cookbooks to object of bakery wars and fixture of national chains to international phenomenon, discussed, Sax is startled to hear, on the streets of Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay.The cupcake chapter, which Sax uses as a reference point for the other trends he documents, illustrates the strengths and flaws of his book: It\u2019s terrifically entertaining, draws on a wide range of characters (most of them self-promoting in the grand American tradition), quotes a variety of people on how and why certain trends took hold and doesn\u2019t spend much time sorting through all this information to see which theories might be the most plausible.If victory has a thousand fathers, Sax believes a few too many of them. A Los Angeles chef named Sang Yoon is allowed, with little contradiction, to take credit for the gourmet hamburger and the gastro pub. Frieda Caplan, the popularizer of the kiwi, is also seen as making the country safe for hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales of brown (versus white) mushrooms. Faith Popcorn, the trend forecaster who practically invented self-promotion, is implicitly given credit for telling Coca-Cola in 1981 to get into bottled water.There\u2019s very likely some truth in all these claims, but a few more caveats would have been in order. As would more fact-checking: Little glitches like the implication that epicures in the late 1950s and \u201860s were called \u201cfoodies,\u201d a term that came into currency only in the wake of the 1980 \u201cOfficial Preppy Handbook,\u201d make you wonder about other points of accuracy.But these are the hazards of any book of nonfiction in an age of self-service journalism. Sax has seized on a big, juicy topic, and is at his best in on-the-scene reporting, where the brisk, funny, assured voice that earned him many fans for his previous book, \u201cSave the Deli\u201d (which I excerpted for The Atlantic\u2019s website), keeps us galloping through the aisles of the gigantic annual Fancy Food Show as he trails a head buyer for Whole Foods, who rightly calls herself the J. Lo of the event. Or through the fields of South Carolina and restaurants of Charleston as he draws a portrait of Glenn Roberts, the founder of Anson Mills (and also a guide to Barber).No matter whom he\u2019s describing, Sax is great company, a writer of real and lasting charm. And he\u2019s capable of some nice social observation: A chapter on the rise and fall of fondue takes us to Florida, where the original Swiss promoters still try, and fail, to make fondue for the kind of swinging parties that originally helped this fad catch on (confronted with a bowl of melted chocolate, guests pick at the fruit because, of course, they\u2019re all on diets), and he\u2019s convincingly able to root the rise of fondue in the sexual revolution and the beginnings of what Faith Popcorn would later label cocooning.At the end, Sax surprised me by defending food trends as good for the economy and moving American food forward \u2014 a somewhat unsatisfactory conclusion just after he\u2019s ably skewered the instantaneous rise of Cronuts. \u201cThe Tastemakers\u201d will leave readers wondering about how susceptible we are to the charms of any new food \u2014 and how long we\u2019re likely to stay captivated.THE TASTEMAKERSWhy We\u2019re Crazy for Cupcakes but Fed Up With FondueBy David Sax318 pp. PublicAffairs. $25.99.THE THIRD PLATEField Notes on the Future of FoodBy Dan Barber486 pp. The Penguin Press. $29.95.Corby Kummer, a senior editor of The \u00adAtlantic, is the author of \u201cThe Pleasures of Slow Food\u201d and \u201cThe Joy of Coffee.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why We\u2019re All Crony Capitalists, Like It or Not", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDebate That DividesIf there\u2019s one thing that populists on the left and right can agree upon, it is disdain for crony capitalism. It is a distaste for the cesspool of Washington influence, in which big-business lobbyists canoodle with lawmakers to get their way. It is anger at corporate welfare enriching America\u2019s biggest companies at the expense of the little guy.But what\u2019s new is that conservative activists are channeling that spirit into a concrete change in policy. Rather than just talking about ending crony capitalism, House Republicans and some of the outside groups that support them and try to push them to the right are looking to eliminate an agency that provides billions in government-funded loans to support American exporters.But when you dive into the debate, it also offers something else: A fascinating case study in how modern economies really work, and the ways big business and big government are inevitably intertwined in ways that believers in free markets may not like \u2014 but may not be able to avoid. In short, we\u2019re all crony capitalists, whether we like it or not.So what is the Ex-Im Bank? Its job is to provide financing for American exports. When a Brazilian airline buys a Boeing 737 or a Turkish electric utility buys General Electric turbines, they can receive financing through the bank at more favorable interest rates than would be available in the private market. Smaller American companies that are looking to export can borrow working capital to help float the costs of selling their goods overseas.The borrowers pay interest on those loans and loan guarantee fees, which allows the bank to return cash to taxpayers; the Congressional Budget Office projects that using standard government accounting rules the bank will refund $14 billion over the next decade to the Treasury Department. But taxpayers are subsidizing the bank to the tune of $2 billion for the same period of time if you use \u201cfair value\u201d accounting, calculating the values of the guarantees and below-market loans the bank issues.So why should the government be running what is, in effect, a very specialized bank? For smaller companies, getting trade finance through privately owned banks is hard simply because only the biggest and most global institutions are in that business.Good luck going to your neighborhood bank branch and asking for a $1 million loan to finance the shipment of industrial equipment to Uruguay, a transaction that includes all types of exotic risks (currency, political, etc.) that will leave your banker scratching his head.Bigger companies \u2014 the Boeings and G.E.'s of the world \u2014 have access to the huge global banks that are used to dealing with those types of risks. But America\u2019s corporate giants have to fight for business against competitors that benefit from advantageous, government-subsidized trade finance. Boeing might have plenty of access to capital from Citigroup or JPMorgan to help its customers finance airplane purchases, yet it has to fight for business against Europe\u2019s Airbus, which is aided by subsidized loans from Europe\u2019s equivalent of the Ex-Im Bank.And there\u2019s the rub for those who want to shut down the Ex-Im Bank. It\u2019s all well and good to assail crony capitalism and to say that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be subsidizing private industry. But it also would amount to unilateral disarmament on the international stage, essentially putting American exporters at a clear disadvantage compared with European and Asian competitors.More broadly, the debate over the Ex-Im Bank exposes an uncomfortable truth about global capitalism. As much as a purist might believe there exists some state of nature in which governments neither subsidize nor obstruct business, and capitalism represents a pure survival of the fittest, that isn\u2019t the world we actually live in.The terms of global trade are determined by high-stakes negotiations between countries over tariffs, market access and common regulatory standards. Tech companies spend vast sums obtaining and defending patents, which are essentially a state-granted monopoly granted to the first one to invent something. American diplomats fight for the interests of American oil companies, among other industries, in their interactions with foreign governments.And the banks that would be expected to fill the vacuum of providing trade finance if the Ex-Im Bank were disbanded were themselves bailed out on a vast scale in 2008, and continue to be intensively regulated.Here\u2019s a delicious irony: One of the leaders of the push to shut down the Export-Import Bank is Delta Air Lines, which doesn\u2019t like the fact that international competitors are able to buy Boeing airplanes more cheaply thanks to American taxpayers.In his mind, it boils down to \u201cthe government picking and choosing between industries in our country.\u201dThere\u2019s a principled libertarian case to be made that this world we live in of big companies and big governments working hand in hand stifles competition and makes consumers worse off. It is less clear that the current push to get rid of the Export-Import Bank would do much of anything to change that.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.\nnytimes.com/upshot Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Principles for Iraq", "Date": "2014-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE disintegration of Iraq and Syria is upending an order that has defined the Middle East for a century. It is a huge event, and we as a country need to think very carefully about how to respond. Having just returned from Iraq two weeks ago, my own thinking is guided by five principles, and the first is that, in Iraq today, my enemy\u2019s enemy is my enemy. Other than the Kurds, we have no friends in this fight. Neither Sunni nor Shiite leaders spearheading the war in Iraq today share our values.The Sunni jihadists, Baathists and tribal militiamen who have led the takeover of Mosul from the Iraqi government are not supporters of a democratic, pluralistic Iraq, the only Iraq we have any interest in abetting. And Iraq\u2019s Shiite prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, has proved himself not to be a friend of a democratic, pluralistic Iraq either. From Day 1, he has used his office to install Shiites in key security posts, drive out Sunni politicians and generals and direct money to Shiite communities. In a word, Maliki has been a total jerk. Besides being prime minister, he made himself acting minister of defense, minister of the interior and national security adviser, and his cronies also control the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry.The second principle for me derives from the most important question we need to answer from the Arab Spring. Why is it that the two states doing the best are those that America has had the least to do with: Tunisia and the semiautonomous Kurdistan region of Iraq? Answer: Believe it or not, it\u2019s not all about what we do and the choices we make. Arabs and Kurds have agency, too. And the reason that both Tunisia and Kurdistan have built islands of decency, still frail to be sure, is because the major contending political forces in each place eventually opted for the principle of \u201cno victor, no vanquished.\u201d The two major rival parties in Kurdistan not only buried the hatchet between them but paved the way for democratic elections that recently brought a fast-rising opposition party, that ran on an anti-corruption platform, into government for the first time. And Tunisia, after much internal struggle and bloodshed, found a way to balance the aspirations of secularists and Islamists and agree on the most progressive Constitution in the history of the Arab world. Hence my rule: The Middle East only puts a smile on your face when it starts with them \u2014 when they take ownership of reconciliation. Please spare me another dose of: It is all about whom we train and arm. Sunnis and Shiites don\u2019t need guns from us. They need the truth. It is the early 21st century, and too many of them are still fighting over who is the rightful heir to the Prophet Muhammad from the 7th century. It has to stop \u2014 for them, and for their kids, to have any future. We still want to forge a nuclear deal that prevents Iran from developing a bomb, so we have to be careful about how much we aid Iran\u2019s Sunni foes. But with Iran still under sanctions and its forces and Hezbollah\u2019s now fighting in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, well, let\u2019s just say: advantage America.Fourth: Leadership matters. While in Iraq, I visited Kirkuk, a city that has long been hotly contested between Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen. When I was there five years ago, it was a hellish war zone. This time I found new paved roads, parks and a flourishing economy and a Kurdish governor, Najimaldin Omar Karim, who was just re-elected in April in a fair election and won more seats thanks to votes from the minority Arabs and Turkmen.\u201cWe focused on [improving] roads, terrible traffic, hospitals, dirty schools,\u201d and increasing electricity from four hours a day to nearly 24 hours, said Dr. Karim, a neurosurgeon who had worked in America for 33 years before returning to Iraq in 2009. \u201cPeople were tired of politics and maximalism. We [earned] the confidence and good feelings of Arabs and Turkmen toward a Kurdish governor. They feel like we don\u2019t discriminate. This election was the first time Turkmen and Arabs voted for a Kurd.\u201d In the recent chaos, the Kurds have now taken full military control of Kirkuk, but I can tell you this: Had Maliki governed Iraq like Karim governed Kirkuk, we would not have this mess today. With the right leadership, people there can live together. Finally, while none of the main actors in Iraq, other than Kurds, are fighting for our values, is anyone there even fighting for our interests: a minimally stable Iraq that doesn\u2019t threaten us? And whom we can realistically help? The answers still aren\u2019t clear to me, and, until they are, I\u2019d be very wary about intervening.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Manufacturing Hits 7-Month High", "Date": "2014-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s manufacturing sector rebounded in June, showing signs of growth for the first time this year, according to a purchasing managers\u2019 index released on Monday.The preliminary reading of the P.M.I. survey for June, compiled by Markit and published by HSBC, rose to 50.8 points, up from a reading of 49.4 in May and notably higher than the 49.7 that economists had forecast.\u201cWe observed a bounce-back of confidence in the economy, which will help bolster demand,\u201d Ting Lu, China economist at the Merrill Lynch unit of Bank of America, wrote Monday in a research note. \u201cBeijing is determined to deliver stable growth with a slew of mini-stimulus measures.\u201dThe final P.M.I. figures for June will be published on July 1, but the preliminary or \u201cflash\u201d survey generally serves as a bellwether for the manufacturing sector and is based on 85 to 90 percent of total responses from the companies surveyed. The June flash figure was the highest in seven months and the first reading above 50 in six months.Although China\u2019s overall economic growth continues to decelerate to its slowest pace in more than a decade, the new data suggest manufacturing may be a pocket of resilience. The preliminary June survey result was bolstered by gains in the level of production and in new orders \u2014 the latter being a sign of stronger growth in the coming weeks and months.\u201cOver the next few months, infrastructure investments and related sectors will continue to support the recovery,\u201d Qu Hongbin, HSBC\u2019s chief economist for China, said in a research note accompanying the data release. \u201cWe expect policy makers to continue their current path of accommodative policy stance until the recovery is sustained.\u201dWhile stopping short of a full-blown stimulus package like the credit-propelled one they unleashed in 2008, China\u2019s leaders have reacted this year to signs of a slowing economy with focused measures intended to keep gross domestic product on pace with the government\u2019s growth target of about 7.5 percent. Those measures have included selective tax breaks for small businesses, accelerated spending on infrastructure projects and a partial relaxation of lending restrictions for small and medium-size banks.The stabilized outlook for manufacturing, which has been echoed in recent months by the results of the government\u2019s official P.M.I. survey, comes as the country\u2019s real estate sector continues to struggle. Data released last week showed China\u2019s average home prices fell in May for the first time in two years, while price weakness spread to more major cities.\u201cThe continued recovery of both manufacturing P.M.I.s in recent months, despite further weakness in the property sector, suggests that the government\u2019s targeted approach to shoring up growth is working,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note on Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats in Coal Country Run From E.P.A.", "Date": "2014-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 It took little time for Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat who is challenging Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, in the most high-profile Senate race this year, to distance herself from the Obama administration\u2019s proposal for sharp cuts to emissions from power plants.Even as the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled its proposed regulation on Monday, Ms. Grimes pledged to \u201cfiercely oppose the president\u2019s attack on Kentucky\u2019s coal industry because protecting our jobs will be my No. 1 priority.\u201dThe reaction came hard and fast here in Kentucky, where coal is woven as deeply into the state\u2019s psyche as basketball and bourbon, and where more than 90 percent of the state\u2019s electricity comes from coal. But the political implications of the emissions proposal reach well beyond this one state, complicating the midterm elections this fall for Democrats, especially since a number of battleground states for control of the Senate are tied to the coal economy.The E.P.A. regulation would cut carbon pollution from power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, particularly from the nation\u2019s more than 600 coal-fired power plants. The rule, which is to be finalized a year from now after a public comment period, gives each state flexibility to devise its own approach to meeting its goals. Experts say it could close hundreds of plants.Republicans quickly seized on the fact that coal provides the majority of electricity in half a dozen states with hard-fought Senate races: Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana and West Virginia. \u201cThis regulation will kill jobs and force energy rates to skyrocket, so it\u2019s no wonder President Obama is circumventing Congress to implement his latest job-killing regulation,\u201d Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Monday.The National Republican Senatorial Committee plans to attack Democratic incumbents in four energy-rich states in recorded phone calls on Tuesday: Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana and Virginia. The Louisiana script, typical of the others, includes the line: \u201cTell Mary Landrieu that this war on American energy just doesn\u2019t make sense for Louisiana.\u201dThe issue is likely to play differently state by state, and in some cases the president\u2019s aggressive action against greenhouse gas emissions from power plants may benefit Democrats who tap into voter sentiment for addressing climate change. Liberals were hailing the president on Monday.But Democrats in conservative states, whose fate could determine control of the Senate, were running from him. Like Ms. Grimes, Natalie Tennant, a Democrat running for an open seat in West Virginia, instantly went on the attack. \u201cI will stand up to President Obama, Gina McCarthy and anyone else who tries to undermine our coal jobs,\u201d Ms. Tennant said, referring to the E.P.A. administrator.Some Democratic strategists noted that the \u201cwar on coal\u201d cry was a losing issue for Republicans last year in the governor\u2019s race in Virginia, which has significant coal mining and which elected a Democrat.\u201cPeople on the Republican side overestimate the feelings for this, and on our side, Democrats are scared for no reason,\u201d said Andrew Baumann, a Democratic pollster. \u201cSome Democrats assume anything about global warming is a political loser. And that\u2019s just not the case.\u201dMr. Baumann identified races in Colorado and Iowa, with growing renewable energy sectors, where confronting global warming could help the Democratic candidate in close Senate contests \u201cif they play it correctly.\u201dIn Colorado, where Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat, is in a tough re-election fight, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, Rick Palacio, pointed to mandates that voters passed years ago that the state generate part of its electricity from renewable resources. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the results of changes in temperatures,\u201d Mr. Palacio said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen historic droughts and wildfires. They\u2019re driving up the cost of everyday life for people in our state.\u201dYet, in contested states such as Arkansas, Kentucky and West Virginia, where the president is deeply unpopular, the challenge for Democrats is greater.Carbon emissions by country and a proposal to significantly cut U.S. levels by 2030.Representative Nick J. Rahall II of West Virginia, one of the most vulnerable Democrats in Congress, took to the House floor last week to pre-emptively denounce the E.P.A. \u201cThe only real question is where on a scale from devastating to a death blow the new rule will fall,\u201d he said.As the president\u2019s health care measure loses some of its punch as a Republican issue, with voters increasingly saying they would rather fix the law than repeal it, climate regulations could gain ground as an issue. An outside group supporting Mr. McConnell, Kentuckians for Strong Leadership, has spent $800,000 on television ads that try to elevate coal to the importance of health care in attacks on Ms. Grimes, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks political advertising.That Ms. Grimes, who has opposed Mr. McConnell on every other issue, is feeling vulnerable was evident from her announcement on Monday of a new six-figure ad campaign targeted to coal country, proclaiming, \u201cPresident Obama and Washington Don\u2019t Get It\u201d above a miner holding out a lump of coal. The McConnell campaign was unimpressed with Ms. Grimes\u2019s effort to distance herself from her party\u2019s leadership. \u201cAlison Lundergan Grimes was recruited by President Obama, who said he would \u2018bankrupt\u2019 the coal industry, and Harry Reid, who said \u2018coal makes us sick,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s spokeswoman said in a statement.As a lesson in the potency of the issue in Kentucky, Republicans point to what happened in the state\u2019s Sixth Congressional District two years ago.Andy Barr, a Republican, defeated a popular four-term Democrat, Ben Chandler, with a focused attack portraying Mr. Chandler as anti-coal because of his vote in Mr. Obama\u2019s first term for a national \u201ccap and trade\u201d bill. (It was defeated in the Senate.)The message resonated even though there is not a single coal-mining job in the Sixth District, which includes Lexington. And it took hold even as coal-mining employment is at a historic low for reasons beyond environmental regulation: competition from cheaper natural gas and the mechanization of mining.Still, among voters here, lines in the fiercely fought Senate contest seemed well established before the latest positioning of both candidates over coal.Bill Rawlins, 67, a retired Republican who works part time as a driver for an auto parts company, said he supported Mr. McConnell. \u201cMy gas bill this past winter tripled,\u201d he said, blaming regulations on coal. \u201cI say it\u2019s forcing the coal industry out. It\u2019s going to trickle down and get worse. Your E.P.A. right now, it\u2019s costing the people so much.\u201dBut Sondra Strunk, a Republican who owns a small business making wine jelly and candy, said renewable energy should replace fossil fuels. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the coal, their jobs, their welfare,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody should give them other work or training, because coal is going to run out one of these days.\u201d Dave Bailey, 59, a Democrat with a \u201cFriends of Coal\u201d sticker in his auto repair shop, gave no credit to Ms. Grimes\u2019s distancing herself from Mr. Obama, adding he would vote for Mr. McConnell. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cThey introduced all these regulations, and the trickle-down effect will hurt all of us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Best Insurance for Texas Workers? \u2018Don\u2019t Get Injured\u2019", "Date": "2014-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTexas TribuneAUSTIN \u2014 Almost anywhere in the vast Lone Star State, one can find evidence of the \u201cTexas miracle\u201d economy that policy makers like Gov. Rick Perry have talked about in their political speeches. The hot economy, they say, is the result of their zealous opposition to over-regulation, greedy trial lawyers and profligate government spending. Texas is the only state that does not require private employers to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance or a private equivalent, so more than 500,000 workers \u2014 about 6 percent of the work force \u2014 receive no occupational benefits if they are injured on the job. On-the-job injuries can leave them unable to work, and with little recourse. More than a million Texans are covered by private occupational insurance from their employers. Those plans are not regulated by the state but are often written to sharply limit the benefits, legal rights and medical options of workers. Employers, however, say their workers often get quicker and better care under the private plans.Most Texas workers, about 81 percent, are covered by a state-regulated compensation system, which provides injured workers with standard benefits, including partial income, medical care and payments to beneficiaries of people who are killed at work. Critics, though, say the system is stacked against workers. \u201cThey throw these workers away like tissue paper. They\u2019re nothing more than a used Kleenex,\u201d said Joe Longley, an Austin employment lawyer who served as chief of the consumer protection division of the attorney general\u2019s office in the 1970s. \u201cWe don\u2019t provide for the workers. We provide for the businesses.\u201dThe state workers\u2019 compensation commissioner, Rod Bordelon, has a different view. He calls the state-regulated insurance program a \u201cterrific system,\u201d and points to a series of positive trends: Claims are down; rates for coverage are down; and fewer injuries are being reported. And within the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation, enforcement actions against insurers have increased, he said.Critics say the reporting failures strip Texans of important information about the coverage their employers offer and the safety of their job sites. Mr. Bordelon said most employers that had opted out of the system simply did not know they were required to report their status. Fines for not reporting have been infrequent. Since 2009, the division has issued a little over $80,000 in fines for reporting violations \u2014 a tiny percentage of the total penalties charged for a variety of workers\u2019 compensation administrative violations over that period, online reports show. Employers that fail to report can be charged up to $25,000 a day until they comply, but division officials could not remember an instance of the maximum fine being levied. After issuing warning letters a few years ago, Mr. Bordelon began fining companies in 2012, generally $500 to $1,500. \u201cA bigger fine would get somebody\u2019s attention,\u201d Mr. Bordelon acknowledged. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start hitting them with bigger and bigger penalties, absolutely.\u201d Like clockwork during biennial legislative sessions, Texans tell lawmakers emotional stories about workplace accidents that occurred while they or their loved ones worked for an uninsured employer. That prompts a predictable round of legislative hand-wringing about the voluntary nature of workplace insurance in Texas.\u201cWe live in a state which prides itself on fewer government regulations, and some see mandatory work comp as just another government regulation hampering business,\u201d Mr. Workman said. Companies that carry workers\u2019 compensation are given immunity from employee negligence lawsuits. While employers offering private compensation insurance are not protected from such lawsuits, many limit their legal exposure through the fine print of private occupational policies that employees accept when they are hired. It is still illegal for employers in the workers\u2019 comp system to retaliate against a worker for pursuing an injury claim, but the Bouchet ruling removed that prohibition for employers that do not carry the state-regulated coverage. Since the Bouchet ruling, Paul Schorn, a Lockhart, Tex., employment lawyer, said he had quit taking retaliatory firing cases from injured Texans not covered by workers\u2019 compensation policies. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to fire those people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, but it doesn\u2019t break any law.\u201d Federal lawsuits are sometimes possible, but they are far more difficult to successfully wage, Mr. Schorn said. Even when an employee does successfully sue because of a workplace injury, recovering damages can be difficult. Santiago Arias, an undocumented immigrant, sued his boss for a 2006 injury in Houston that left him paralyzed, but he recovered less than what doctors say his care would cost each year. And Angel Hurtado\u2019s family, which received no compensation, asked seven lawyers to file a lawsuit after the roofer fell to his death in 2004. But the contractor disappeared after the accident, and no lawyer would take the case, family members said.People who have tried to navigate the system to receive workers\u2019 compensation insurance have their own horror stories. In more than 90 percent of injury cases, the parties resolve the issue informally. Mr. Bordelon, a Perry appointee, says that is because the two sides are encouraged to work out their differences. Advocates for injured employees say workers often just give up when insurers deny their claims, which happens routinely.Over the last five years, insurance companies have denied or disputed in whole or in part about 45 percent of every claim initially filed, according to unpublished data obtained by The Texas Tribune. Even when claimants win their disputes at an administrative hearing, they sometimes face judicial reviews, meaning the insurer can take them to state district court. Workers can file such challenges, too, but it takes money to engage in a lawsuit. After Crystal Davis\u2019s husband died in 2012 in a company car near Tyler, Tex. \u2014 on the way to what his supervisor said was a work assignment for Burger King \u2014 the state awarded her family death benefits. Now, the insurer has sued her and her minor children to take them away. \u201cIt\u2019s such a twisted system to weed through,\u201d she said. \u201cAnybody that does have a job and could be covered under workmen\u2019s comp really needs to think about how they are covered, and if they are covered, and how much they\u2019re willing to fight for what they think they\u2019re covered by.\u201dCiting the litigation, Burger King and its insurer, ACE American, both declined to comment on the case.The court argued that the Legislature intended that state bureaucrats, not plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, punish through fines and administrative actions any insurance companies that behave badly or process claims unfairly.Former State Senator John Montford, Democrat of Lubbock, said he had inserted a provision into a 1989 workers\u2019 compensation overhaul that allowed for certain bad-faith lawsuits, partly as \u201cfallback\u201d protection for workers in case insurers went too far.\u201cHad we intended to repeal that provision on bad faith, we would have taken it out,\u201d he said.Mr. Bordelon, for his part, said he welcomed the enforcement role of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner. There is no specific administrative violation for \u201cbad faith\u201d actions, but he said the agency had increased its issuance of fines for a variety of misdeeds and now levies more than $1 million a year.\u201cWe\u2019ve stepped up enforcement efforts in the division for all kinds of violations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are penalizing more and more carriers for inappropriate denials.\u201d Critics say they are not seeing much restraint from insurers. With so much of the workplace unregulated, and a pro-insurer bent in the slice of it that is regulated, they say rank-and-file workers are taking on most of the risk these days in the land of the Texas miracle.Mr. Schorn, the Lockhart employment attorney, shrugged when asked how Texans could prevent a workplace accident from turning into a legal or medical nightmare.\u201cDon\u2019t get injured,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t get anybody mad at you. Don\u2019t let anybody misunderstand you. Don\u2019t be in the wrong place at the wrong time. \u201cI really can\u2019t think of any way that someone can protect themselves from this any more than you can protect yourself from a lightning strike. It\u2019s just, if you work in Texas, it can happen to you.\u201djroot@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Student Borrowers and the Economy", "Date": "2014-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPresident Obama took an important step this week when he signed an executive order providing relief to millions of struggling student loan borrowers and urged Congress to pass a student loan refinancing bill that is scheduled for a vote in the Senate on Wednesday. Both the executive order and the refinancing bill speak to a grave problem that has trapped recent college graduates and threatens the long-term health of the economy. This problem has its roots in the financial crisis, which destroyed trillions of dollars in household savings and home equity that families might otherwise have used to pay for college. (Even before the recession, the state colleges, which educate about 70 percent of the nation\u2019s students, reacted to state budget cuts by raising tuition.) With no other choice, students and their families financed college by relying more heavily on student loans. According to the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, student debt has doubled since 2007 and now stands at about $1.2 trillion. Stagnant wages and a tough job market have made it difficult for borrowers to repay these debts. According to federal statistics, for example, about seven million of the nation\u2019s 40 million student loan borrowers are in default. The people in this large and growing pariah class have difficulty getting jobs or credit, or renting apartments. But borrowers who narrowly earn enough to make loan payments are not much better off; they have to put off car purchases and bunk with their parents because they can\u2019t afford rents, and they can\u2019t even begin to think about saving for retirement. As an official from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau told a Senate hearing earlier this month, student debt is having a kind of \u201cdomino effect,\u201d damaging other areas of the economy. And unless federal policy makers intervene in a muscular way, this generation of student borrowers could become a long-term drag on the economy. The executive order signed on Monday will help up to five million student loan borrowers. It will expand access to the federal government\u2019s Pay as You Earn program, which allows borrowers to arrange affordable payments and qualify for loan forgiveness. It requires the Department of Education to evaluate more stringently how well the companies that collect federal loans keep borrowers out of default. Most significantly, it requires the department to help people who have defaulted rehabilitate their records through a program allowing lower payments. Homeowners, businesses and individuals can take advantage of low interest rates to refinance their debts. Student borrowers, however, have few such options. The Senate bill, known as the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, would create a fund \u2014 paid for by a new minimum tax on millionaires and billionaires \u2014 that would be used to help people with federal or private student loans refinance those loans at lower interest rates. The bill might pass the Senate, but House Republicans will oppose any such tax. Still, by bringing the matter to a vote, Senate Democrats underscore the need to do something about dire indebtedness among recent graduates, and also give members of their party a potent issue on which to run in the midterm elections. Even if the refinancing bill were to become law, it would represent only part of the solution. To get a handle on this problem, Congress needs to reconfigure the student aid system to prevent the most vulnerable student borrowers from falling too deeply into debt in the first place.

It was standard issue to senior civil servants and government officials; its possession implied status, and its ubiquity was a sign of an earlier, seemingly simpler India.The country\u2019s highly protectionist economy also made it one of the few cars on the road, with a singular design that has often been compared to a bowler hat.In their statement announcing the shutdown, Hindustan Motors cited a \u201clack of demand\u201d for the Ambassador and a shortage of funds, as well as \u201cgrowing indiscipline\u201d among factory workers at the West Bengal plant.In the 1980s, Maruti introduced the Alto 800, an underpowered but inexpensive hatchback that brought car ownership to the masses. In the 1990s when the economy was liberalized, the Indian car market slowly opened up to faster, more convenient options.\u201cThe death of the Ambassador may have formally been announced earlier last month, but in reality the Ambassador vanished from Indian roads 10 years ago,\u201d said Siddharth Varadarajan, a journalist who owns three Ambassadors.The virtual monopoly that Hindustan Motors possessed for decades, he said, was the car\u2019s undoing.\u201cThere was never any incentive for Hindustan Motors to improve the product,\u201d Mr. Varadarajan said. \u201cThey were a highly myopic company.\u201dThe company, however, has maintained that the halting of its production is temporary, and that the plant in West Bengal will eventually reopen.It is the car of Nehruvian India, its white, be-curtained iteration the conveyance of dignitaries including, at times, the president.In this sense, the Ambassador holds the singular distinction of being one of the few vehicles whose mention evokes power, elegance and something pleasingly retro, even as its manifestation, in the form of taxis and government vehicles in Kolkata and Delhi, often borders on disrepair.Drivers complain that pedals break off after a few thousand miles, that the air-conditioners malfunction. Some use turmeric to stop up holes in the radiator \u2014 anything to avoid servicing with expensive and increasingly rare parts. Many carry water bottles to cool off radiators that frequently overheat.But the fondness for some drivers, whose cars took them through decades of India\u2019s history, seems to overpower any inconvenience.V. P. Verma, a retired engineer, parks his mint green Ambassador proudly outside his south Delhi home. He said the waiting list for the car when his father, a district administrative officer in Bihar, bought it in 1962 was five years.\u201cTo possess an Ambassador in 1962 was like possessing an Audi in India now,\u201d said Mr. Verma. \u201cIt was status, prestige.\u201dHe recalled how they packed in the entire family \u2014 14 people \u2014 on road trips between Darbhanga, a town in north Bihar, to Patna, its capital. Twenty years ago, the car took him and his wife on a 1,000-kilometer trip from Ranchi in present-day Jharkhand State, through Uttar Pradesh, up to the hills of Almora at the foot of the Himalayas, and did not break down once. Though friends have pressed him to replace it, it remains his only car.\u201cIt needs a face-lift now and then,\u201d said his wife, Sabine Verma. \u201cBut its heart is still strong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Janet Yellen Is Trying to Tell Us", "Date": "2014-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInterpreting the FedOne huge question was hanging over the Federal Reserve before Wednesday\u2019s Fed-a-palooza. And in the course of a statement after the central bank\u2019s policy meeting; new forecasts for the economy and interest rates; and a Q. and A. from Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, it got at least a semblance of an answer.The question is this: Is the central bank ready to move briskly with unwinding its era of extraordinary stimulus in the economy, confident that the recovery will continue strengthening without monetary support struts? Or does the Fed expect to continue flooding the economy with cheap money well beyond the point where growth is truly robust?Ms. Yellen, less than half a year into her job leading the central bank, is already adept at saying a lot of words while conveying minimal new information. But if you read between the lines of her comments, she is clearly tilting toward the latter. She displayed no hint that her rate-increasing trigger finger was getting itchy.Here are the nuggets we detected in the various communications that shed light on where the Fed is going.It happened again Wednesday. Leaders of the central bank now expect G.D.P. to rise only 2.1 to 2.3 percent in 2014, compared with a 2.8 to 3 percent forecast in March. The Fed left its forecasts for 2015 and 2016 growth unchanged, but the fact that stronger growth remains on the more distant horizon \u2014 not a reality this year \u2014 argues for resisting any inclination to hike rates sooner rather than later.She emphasized that those month-to-month inflations were \u201cnoisy\u201d and said that inflation seemed to be evolving broadly along the lines the Fed had been expecting. Had she said nothing, that would have implied she was laying the groundwork for the recent uptick in inflation as a rationale for, say, tapering off the Fed\u2019s bond buying program faster or raising interest rates sooner.The Fed\u2019s projections supported the same notion. Leaders of the central bank expected 1.5 to 1.7 percent inflation in 2014, nearly identical to their forecast in March and a level below their target. That implies that recent higher inflation readings have not caused them to reset their expectations broadly.Responding to a later question, she said: \u201cFor the moment, I don\u2019t see any trade-off whatsoever in achieving our two objectives. They both call for the same policy, namely, a highly accommodative monetary policy.\u201dShe argued that stock market prices appeared broadly in line with historical norms relative to earnings. She said that the Fed monitors risks to financial stability, such as underwriting standards for loans and lending rates on risky debt, but used language similar to what she has used in the past, not the tone that would suggest growing alarm about financial bubbles.\u201cI don\u2019t see kinds of broad trends that would suggest to me that the level of financial stability risks has risen above a moderate level,\u201d she said.But Ms. Yellen explicitly recommended against reading much of anything into the chart filled with blue dots that the Fed uses to convey that information. \u201cI would caution that we\u2019ve had turnover,\u201d she said, referring to two officials leaving the policy committee and three new ones joining since March. That, she said, \u201ccan create changes in projections that are difficult to interpret.\u201dAdd it all up, and while the Fed events Wednesday shouldn\u2019t radically transform anybody\u2019s notion of where the central bank is headed, it should put a damper on some of the talk that Ms. Yellen is eager to head for the easy money exits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video: The Subaru XV Crosstrek Hybrid Won\u2019t Save Much Green", "Date": "2014-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySubaru and Prius owners are fiercely loyal to their rides. Subie drivers (who often dwell in polar vortex regions) pledge their allegiance to the Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive flag. The evangelical hybrid camp is more obsessed with fuel economy than getting places quickly. Conversely, it\u2019s unwise to off-road a Prius, and the only way to guarantee lofty m.p.g.s in a Subaru is coasting from a mountain summit.Subaru built its own hybrid system because engineers wanted to keep the 2-liter 4-cylinder boxer engine and the low center of gravity driving dynamics that result from its flat profile. A torque-rich 13.4-horsepower electric motor is built into the system\u2019s continuously-variable transmission. A simulated manual-shift mode is summoned with steering wheel paddle shifters. The nickel-metal hydride battery pack is mounted in the trunk floor.The E.P.A. rates the standard model\u2019s fuel-economy average at 28 miles per gallon. The hybrid gets a 31 m.p.g. (29 city, 33 highway) E.P.A. rating. That\u2019s not a huge difference. In a week of mixed driving, I averaged 27 m.p.g., a far cry from 45 m.p.g. I often see driving a Prius.The gas engine always turns over when starting the car. Subaru\u2019s overall hybrid powertrain dynamic is less like driving a Prius and more like driving a standard car with one of those new start-stop systems. In stop-and-go rush-hour-type driving, the obvious on-off cycling of the gas engine gets tedious.Subaru isn\u2019t known for luxurious interiors, but the faithful seem to overlook that. Ultimately, the XV Crosstrek remains as useful as the standard version. The back seat is comfortable for two adults, and the trunk stays about the same size (the battery fills the space where a spare tire normally lives).Obviously, the price grows. The top-of-the-line Touring model featured in the video retails for $30,120 with shipping. That\u2019s about $3,000 more than the gas-only Crosstrek. Do the math: It\u2019s tough to make your money back on fuel savings. If you simply must have a hybrid badge (or the Plasma Green paint) on your Subaru, then the slightly sportier XV Crosstrek Hybrid might be for you. Everyone else will be happy with the standard XV, and a lot of green left over for camping gear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Are Less Volatile. Should We Worry?", "Date": "2014-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestor OutlookIf the stock market was a person, right now it would be a supremely easygoing retiree on the beach in Key West drinking a pi\u00f1a colada. Mr. Market is very, very relaxed.To distill that notion in a single number, take a look at the Vix, an index that captures how investors expect the stock market to gyrate over the coming month. On Friday, it neared its record low level, last reached in January 2007. A related indicator of the same phenomenon: The last time the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index moved by more than 1 percent in a day was April 16, nearly two months ago. It\u2019s not just stocks: Measures of volatility in the bond, currency and commodity markets are near multiyear lows as well.Investors have often used the Vix as a \u201cfear gauge\u201d over the last six years of rolling crises. Lower Vix, less to worry about. The current reading implies that there is very little fear that either the economy or market conditions will diverge from the steady, comfortable path that they are now on.For much of the last six years, there was a battle between the forces of financial chaos emanating from the global financial crisis and its euro zone offshoot, and central bankers and other policy makers trying to contain that chaos. The policy makers unequivocally won, or at least are winning handily now. Years of near-zero interest rates and the printing of trillions of dollars (and yen, and euros) have overwhelmed markets, and seem to be a major factor in eliminating wild swings from markets.If you are the nervous type (and central bankers in particular are paid to worry about what might go wrong), you could argue the same thing is happening now; the decline in volatility is a signal that investors are once again becoming too comfortable with risk.If you believe in Minsky Moments, it has all kinds of policy implications \u2014 particularly that the slow, steady, gradual path the Fed has mapped out for withdrawing its easy money policies is in fact too slow and steady and gradual. Maybe, if you buy this thesis, the Fed should move a little more erratically, constantly adjusting the speed of its withdrawal based on the latest kernel of economic data.I\u2019m not persuaded, though, for a couple of reasons.First, the reality is that if we forget Wall Street for a minute, the economy itself has displayed uncommon stability over the last year. The economic expansion appears well entrenched, and the open question now is whether job growth and wages are starting to accelerate, or merely continuing their gradual improvement of the last few years.So this may be less a case of investors becoming complacent and more a case of the real-world economy becoming more stable, and markets adjusting to reflect this reality. It would be much more worrisome if central bank money-printing had eliminated volatility in markets at a time the underlying economy remained uncertain.Second, in a Minskyite view of the world, low market volatility isn\u2019t the cause of the buildup of risk in the economy per se, but rather creates extra incentive for various players in the economy to take on more risk. Companies and households use more borrowed money, banks make riskier loans, and that type of behavior creates the risk of a precipitous collapse when conditions turn.In that sense, the thing to watch in assessing whether financial conditions are getting bubbly is not the Vix or other measures of market volatility, but lending standards, bank leverage and other measures of risk-taking. Some of those indicators are showing worrisome signs, others not so much. But just knowing that the stock market is less volatile doesn\u2019t answer the question.Advertisement"}

Yet it is worth reflecting on a remarkable achievement: The court has agreed unanimously in more than 66 percent of its cases this term (and that figure holds even if Monday\u2019s remaining two cases, on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive coverage and on public-sector unions, are not unanimous). The last year this happened was 1940.The justices\u2019 ability to cross partisan divides and find common ground in their bottom-line judgment in roughly two-thirds of their cases \u2014 including the two decisions handed down Thursday, restricting the president\u2019s ability to issue recess appointments during brief breaks in the Senate\u2019s work, and striking down a Massachusetts ban on protests near abortion clinics \u2014 should remind us that even in this hyperpartisan age, there is a difference between law and politics. Unanimity is important because it signals that the justices can rise above their differences and interpret the law without partisanship. The best illustration of this in the modern era is Brown v. Board of Education, in which the court unanimously declared racial segregation in education to be unconstitutional. When the justices forge common ground, it signals to the nation the deep-seated roots of what the court has said and contributes to stability in the fabric of the law.The court has not always valued consensus so highly. At the nation\u2019s founding, the justices each wrote separate opinions \u2014 leaving lawyers, and indeed the nation, to guess what the court was actually saying as a whole. It took Chief Justice John Marshall\u2019s leadership, at the start of the 19th century, to bring the court together and to establish the practice of writing a single opinion for the court. Marshall was not above using hard and soft persuasion, going so far as to invite his colleagues to live together in a Washington boardinghouse, where they bonded and discussed cases over Madeira. Disagreement on the court in that century was rare, with dissents occurring only roughly 10 percent of the time. Chief Justice William H. Taft, in the first decades of the 20th century, reportedly talked his colleagues out of more than 200 dissenting votes with his formidable political skills.But the modern era has been something of a disaster for unanimity. Chief Justice Earl Warren was able to achieve unanimity only 36.1 percent of the time; Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, a scant 35.8 percent. One of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist\u2019s final public acts was to express exasperation at the fractured court. In 2005, on the final day of his final term, a frail Rehnquist described his last majority opinion by first outlining his views, then the three concurrences filed, and then the three dissents filed, and joking, \u201cI didn\u2019t know we had that many people on our court.\u201d Compare that talk, and those numbers, to what Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. achieved this year with his colleagues.People remember Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s 2005 confirmation hearing for his statement that his job would be to call balls and strikes. But something else he said is worth remembering: that he would try to bring about \u201ca greater degree of coherence and consensus in the opinions of the court.\u201d He pointed to Warren\u2019s leadership in Brown as an example.Unanimity, of course, would mean little if it were reserved only for minor things. But the court was unanimous this term in cases that posed big central questions, like whether the government could search your cellphone without a warrant, whether software could be patented, whether the rules for class-action securities lawsuits should change, and many others. Those cases were not easy ones. In the cellphone case, the government made forceful points about the ways in which those searches were permissible, and indeed necessary, for law enforcement. The software industry and its foes argued vociferously about whether software patents were destroying the economy or creating it. And so on. What\u2019s more, the court wasn\u2019t unanimous because the justices sat on their hands; to the contrary, they reversed the lower court 74 percent of the time this year.Many justices have pointed out the importance of published dissent. There is no doubt that dissents can serve a useful role by explaining when a justice thinks the majority has gone off the deep end. But unanimity also sends its own powerful message \u2014 one that might be eclipsed in the headlines by a sensational dissent, but could ultimately have a greater impact. Take the abortion decision on Thursday, which was unanimous in its bottom line, but not in its reasoning. Chief Justice Roberts joined four justices appointed by Democratic presidents \u2014 the same lineup that saved the Affordable Care Act two years ago, that time for a liberal result, unlike Thursday\u2019s. This path, of trying to forge places of agreement even among people who are inclined to disagree, is the essence of what the American experiment is all about. In an era when the leadership of the House of Representatives is suing the president, when people across the aisle cannot even be in the same room with one another, the modesty and cultivated collegiality of the nine members of the Supreme Court this year remind us all that there is another way.Instead of worrying about balls and strikes, Chief Justice Roberts has shifted his efforts to a new focus: making all nine justices play ball for the same team. The country, and the rule of law, are better off for it. Advertisement"}

I believe it is a defining issue for our party and our movement.\u201d And what was this government agency that he felt so strongly about? Would you believe the Export-Import Bank of the United States? Seriously.It also costs the taxpayers nothing \u2014 not only does it support itself through the fees and interest it charges for its services, it also regularly sends money to the Treasury to reduce the debt, some $2 billion over the last five years. Its default rate is negligible. The Chamber of Commerce backs the Ex-Im Bank \u2014 and so do some unions. Basically, says its chairman, Fred Hochberg, \u201cWe support U.S. jobs, especially when those jobs are facing off against foreign competition.\u201d In other words, it would be hard to find a more useful government agency than the Export-Import Bank. For decades, its reauthorization was often passed in Congress without even a roll-call vote. Besides, lots of countries have agencies that do what the Ex-Im Bank does, and many countries rely on them far more heavily than we do. So how is it that this relatively small agency \u2014 of all the agencies in the federal government \u2014 has become the latest Tea Party pi\u00f1ata? What are those ideological objections? The usual: the government shouldn\u2019t be picking winners and losers. (The Export-Import Bank doesn\u2019t.) Companies like Boeing are receiving corporate welfare when they work with the Ex-Im Bank. (In fact, export help from the government is a critical part of airline financing; if the Ex-Im Bank didn\u2019t help Boeing, the sales would go to Airbus, which gets plenty of its own government assistance.) And so on.But there is also another reason these groups are attacking the Export-Import Bank. They can actually win the fight if our do-nothing Congress does nothing. Reauthorization requires the passage of a bill, and, so far, Hensarling has shown no signs of moving such a bill out of his committee. Nor is he likely to.Thus does the fate of a most useful government agency rest in the hands of a man who believes there is no such thing. Advertisement"}

We would just do whatever was needed at the moment.\u201dFor a musical with a time-skipping narrative that wonders about the happenstance hand of fate and the random nature of human connection, \u201cFly by Night\u201d has come to life through a fittingly serendipitous series of events.Ms. Rosenstock recalls standing outside the building after each performance during its initial run at Yale and feeling a buzz gathering around the show. \u201cI realized that something special was happening in that theater,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember saying to Michael and Will, \u2018I think we made a real show here!\u2019\u00a0\u201dStill, it came as a total surprise when they got a call the following spring from Meredith McDonough, who was then the director of TheatreWorks\u2019 New Works Festival. \u201cShe said, \u2018I just read your script, and I want to produce a workshop of it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Rosenstock recalled. \u201cMy first question was: \u2018How? We haven\u2019t sent it out to anyone.\u2019 Even our agents didn\u2019t have \u2018Fly by Night.\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnbeknown to its creators, their Yale playwriting instructor, the Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist Paula Vogel, had emailed the script to several theater administrators she knew were scouting for new musicals. \u201cIt was a really wonderful, sneaky thing that she did \u2014 and behind our backs!\u201d Ms. Rosenstock said with a laugh.In the show, which climaxes during the Northeast blackout of 1965, the hapless sandwich maker Harold finds his dead mother\u2019s old guitar stashed away in a closet, teaches himself how to play and begins writing songs. With an onstage band performing a \u201960s-inspired rock score, the show chronicles the tale of Harold and the two women he falls for: the would-be Broadway star Daphne and her introspective sister, Miriam, an astronomy buff.Intersecting with the three heartsick souls are Harold\u2019s bereft father, his cantankerous boss Crabble, and Joey Storms, a jittery playwright writing a showcase piece for Daphne. Adam Chanler-Berat, Allison Case and Peter Friedman are among those in the cast.\u201cIt\u2019s a fable about connection and how the little moments in our lives add up to the big moments in our lives,\u201d said Carolyn Cantor, the show\u2019s director.\u201cFly by Night\u201d is an unusual collaboration, in that its creators do not distinguish among who wrote the book, music and lyrics, since all three have contributed to each. As they\u00a0continue to write fresh dialogue, lyrics and even new songs, Ms. Cantor observed, the three seem to work as a\u00a0single organism.\u201cThey will go off by themselves, hash it out, probably scream and yell, then come to some sort of consensus and return with something they\u2019ve written,\u201d Ms. Cantor said. \u201cIt may be slower going at times, because there\u2019s not always agreement about the right thing to do in certain situations. But the piece feels like it has a singular voice, in part because they\u2019re each really invested in all three areas.\u201dIn the five years they\u2019ve been toiling on \u201cFly by Night,\u201d their individual careers have also started to take off.As they refine and\u00a0reshape individual scenes and moments in \u201cFly by Night,\u201d the\u00a0creators are\u00a0able to draw on the experiences they\u2019ve accumulated working in show business since graduating from Yale. Ms. Rosenstock said the most helpful skill she\u2019s mastered as a television writer is economy of language.\u201cI love nothing more than a three-page monologue in a play,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now, I\u2019m also really thrilled if I can figure out how to tell the most efficient version of a scene. You only get 21 minutes and 35 seconds to tell a story\u201d on \u201cNew Girl,\u201d \u201cso you can\u2019t be precious about everything.\u201dBoth she and Mr. Mitnick said they\u2019ve gotten better at working on a tight timetable. \u201cSometimes, you\u2019ll be on set, and you have just a few minutes to try to rewrite a scene or tweak something that needs fixing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned how to dig deep and figure out how to solve something really fast no matter how panicked I am.\u201dMr. Connolly, who first joined \u201cOnce\u201d during an early developmental workshop, got to watch and learn at the feet of the director John Tiffany, the choreographer Steven Hoggett and their creative team.What he took away from the process is that \u201cless is more\u201d and to trust the raw material and let it grow naturally \u2014 a key to successfully rendering both the delicate love story in \u201cOnce\u201d and the romantic triangle at the center of \u201cFly by Night.\u201d\u201cNow, being on the other side of the table,\u201d Mr. Connolly said, \u201cI\u2019ve started to realize that there\u2019s a very simple, organic way to let these discoveries blossom \u2014 and to recognize when they\u2019re happening and not strangle them or stifle them in any way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Egyptians who rebelled against President Hosni Mubarak and overthrew him have lived for three years through conditions worse than those they revolted against. Security has broken down, the economy is in the doldrums and Egyptian society is threatened by anarchy.According to government statistics, the unemployment rate rose to over 13 percent (up to 3.7 million for the first quarter of this year from 2.4 million in the first quarter of 2010). A huge fall in foreign visitors dealt a crushing blow to the tourism industry; its revenue in the first three months of 2014 fell by 43 percent from the same quarter in 2013. The number of those living in poverty \u2014 officially defined as earning less than $500 a year \u2014 rose from 21.6 percent in 2009 to 26.3 percent at the end of 2013. The millions now celebrating the presidential victory of the former army chief, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, are the same people who were in the streets celebrating the fall of Mr. Mubarak, and who then came out cheering Mohamed Morsi\u2019s election as president in 2012, and who demonstrated last June to have him ousted. In short, these Egyptians have been so ground down by poverty, anarchy, the lack of security and ceaseless terrorist attacks that they worship President Sisi as a hero and look to him to rescue them from their travails.During a recent public meeting, a woman exclaimed to him: \u201cMy son was set upon and killed by armed men in the street. I have lost my son and all I ask of you is security. Just security.\u201d She typifies the millions of Egyptians who want order restored at any cost. They don\u2019t care about the return of a police state or the reports from human rights organizations condemning the arbitrary arrests and the torture of detainees. Mr. Sisi\u2019s supporters, who are the majority, have lost much of their enthusiasm for the 2011 revolution. They consider it the cause of all the subsequent crises, and they have been subjected to a fierce propaganda effort on the TV channels owned by Mr. Mubarak\u2019s former cronies claiming that the Tahrir Square protests were an American-inspired plot. Despite the absence of evidence, this smear campaign had such an effect on public opinion that many young revolutionaries found themselves accused of being traitors. Mr. Sisi can also count on support from state institutions, as well as from those who made their fortunes in the Mubarak era. The latter hope that Mr. Sisi will be a new Mubarak who will consolidate their wealth and influence. Still lurking on the political stage, though, is the Muslim Brotherhood, which refuses to accept that the population rose up against it. The Brotherhood prefers to live in an ideological realm where it is fighting a holy war for Islam against the enemies of religion. Stage left are the revolutionaries who oppose Mr. Sisi and reject his authoritarianism even if it restores law and order. So far, the opposition to Mr. Sisi is weak.Has the Egyptian revolution therefore run its course? Revolutions may be defeated, but not reversed, since they bring about deep, irrevocable changes in human outlook and behavior. Egyptians have conquered their fear and learned how to determine the fate of their country. They have toppled two presidents in less than three years. Mr. Sisi\u2019s current overwhelming support is thus not absolute, but conditional upon his realizing what Egyptians want. The new president has three options. He can rework the old system, protecting corrupt officials and continuing Mr. Mubarak\u2019s policies, which relied on repression and graft. The gamble for Mr. Sisi would be whether Egyptians, who endured that sort of regime for 30 years, would have the stomach to rise up against it again. The second course is to reinstall the type of national-revolutionary autocratic rule so prevalent in Arab countries in the 1950s and \u201960s, with a strongman imposing a kind of egalitarianism while depriving people of political rights. History shows that even a well-meaning dictator ends up dragging his country into catastrophe, his achievements tinged with tyranny. The third way is the most difficult. Mr. Sisi should exploit his sweeping popularity to make a genuine effort to stamp out corruption, bring in progressive taxation and reduce poverty. At the same time, he should guarantee personal freedoms, put an end to arrests and torture and respect the Constitution and the law. We\u2019ll soon know which option Mr. Sisi chooses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghans, Looking Ahead to U.S. Withdrawal, Vote With Guarded Optimism", "Date": "2014-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Afghans lined up on Saturday to vote in the second and final round of the country\u2019s presidential election, choosing a new leader to steer Afghanistan through the coming withdrawal of American-led military forces. Despite reports of numerous attacks in rural parts of the country, the Taliban appear to have failed to disrupt the voting.While the euphoria of the first round was missing in the capital, Kabul, on Saturday, Afghans nonetheless exhibited a guarded optimism about their future. For those who survived a devastating civil war and the harsh rule of the Taliban, the opportunity to exercise the freedom to vote was not to be passed up \u2014 even if this was the second time they were voting for a president in two months.\u201cWhen I was a young man, there was war,\u201d said Ghulam Bahuddin, 50, a government employee. \u201cYou weren\u2019t safe stepping into the street. Now I can vote and choose who should lead us.\u201dThe election has so far proved to be an unexpected bright spot for Afghans and their Western backers, setting up the country for the first peaceful transfer of power in its history. But the next president will face major challenges: The Taliban remain a potent threat, the economy is on the verge of a free fall, and corruption is so pervasive that many believe it poses as great a risk to stability as the insurgency.Already, both camps have said that fraud would be the only reason for their candidate\u2019s defeat. Perhaps the biggest challenge will be getting the campaigns \u2014 and their followers \u2014 to accept the final results announced by the election commission.\u201cDr. Abdullah was the winner in the first round, but the government wouldn\u2019t allow it,\u201d said Zulheja Kohistani, 45, who was monitoring a polling place in Kabul for the Abdullah campaign. \u201cHe will win the second round one way or the other. We may go against the government if he isn\u2019t declared the winner.\u201dScattered violence was reported across the country. Some women and children were killed by rocket attacks. Interior Ministry officials said that 11 police officers, 15 soldiers and at least 20 civilians died in gun battles and bombings. But by the time the polls closed, the Taliban did not appear to have carried out any major attacks in urban areas. A few rocket attacks in Kabul before the polls opened barely registered.Hours after polls closed, the authorities in Herat Province reported that the Taliban had cut off the fingers of 13 people who had voted. Voters have their index fingers dipped in ink to ensure that they vote only once.Throughout the day, the Taliban claimed that their fighters were sowing chaos, eager to assert that they had affected the runoff election after having largely failed to disrupt the April voting. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the insurgents, posted messages on Twitter that included reports of \u201cbig blasts\u201d and threats about \u201chalting the vote.\u201dBut voters lined up in Kabul\u2019s neighborhoods early Saturday paid little mind to the Taliban. While the lines at Zarghoona High School were shorter than those seen in April, Afghans who were casting ballots characterized their actions as historic.Mohammad Ismail, who owns a tire shop in the city, brought his 6-year-old daughter, Nida, to the polls at a nearby mosque. \u201cShe insisted,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cWhen I told her she didn\u2019t have a voter card, she told me she would use mine.\u201dAs the line ebbed, Mr. Ismail lingered near the entrance to the polling site as Nida hid behind his leg. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d have the chance to bring my daughter to participate in a vote,\u201d he said.The presidential campaign, which began nearly six months ago, has emerged as welcome news for a country where very little has gone as expected in the past year. Despite the Taliban\u2019s threats, tens of thousands of Afghans turned out for rallies, and the first round drew a high turnout. The threatened wave of violence never materialized.But as electoral officials tallied votes after the first round and winnowed the field of eight contenders down to two, the campaign\u2019s festive feel subsided. It quickly became apparent that there was ample fraud in the first round of voting \u2014 about 375,000 votes were disqualified \u2014 even if it was not enough to have altered the outcome.Some candidates and observers fear that the runoff election will involve more fraud, especially in areas of insecurity, where monitoring the polls is extremely difficult.Throughout most of the day, election observers and officials worried that the turnout would be far lower than the first round, assessments based on anecdotal evidence. But unlike last time, voters did not have to wade through sheets of provincial council candidates. They merely had to choose between the two presidential contenders, making the process far faster.\u201cYou don\u2019t see long queues like the last election, but this does not mean the participation is less compared to the first round of elections,\u201d said Aziz Ahmad Rasooli, the head of the election commission in Bamian Province. \u201cThe reason is because the process has been sped up and there is an increase in the number of polling stations in the province.\u201dWith the race down to Mr. Abdullah and Mr. Ghani, the campaign began to take on a harder edge. Afghanistan\u2019s president has vast powers and appoints nearly every official in the country, and supporters on each side are well aware that backing the loser could cost them their livelihoods.In recent weeks, Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic divide has also become an undertone in the campaign, with Mr. Ghani, a Pashtun, facing off against Mr. Abdullah, who is of mixed ancestry but is widely seen as a Tajik.Both men selected running mates from other ethnic groups, and both emphasized the need for unity throughout the campaign. But their supporters showed far less restraint, and appeals to ethnicity increasingly became a feature of the campaign as the runoff election approached.Voters interviewed in Tajik areas on Saturday were nearly uniform in their support for Mr. Abdullah. In Pashtun areas, most said they supported Mr. Ghani because he was one of them. Pashtuns have traditionally ruled Afghanistan, and many were appalled at the idea that a Tajik could be their next president, even if his father was Pashtun.\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d said Qari Sayyed Ummar Hotak, a provincial council member from Kabul overseeing a local polling center in a Pashtun enclave of the city. \u201cMost of the votes here will be for Ashraf Ghani.\u201dMohammad Wali, an older man seated by the entrance to the polling center, was even more explicit. \u201cAs a Pashtun, I will vote for Ashraf Ghani,\u201d Mr. Wali said.Reporting was contributed by Ahmad Shakib, Haris Kakar and Jawad Sukhanyar from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}

Those living a few blocks across the border in Texas did not.David Tramel and Janice McFall, who do not have health insurance, live in a tent hidden in a field by a highway in Texas.TEXARKANA, Tex. \u2014 On a hazy, hot evening here, Janice Marks ate a dinner of turkey and stuffing at a homeless shelter filled with plastic cots before crossing a few blocks to the Arkansas side of town to start her night shift restocking the dairy cases at Walmart.The next day, David Tramel and Janice McFall had a free meal of hot dogs and doughnut holes at a Salvation Army center in Arkansas before heading back to their tent, hidden in a field by the highway in Texas.None of the three have health insurance. But had Ms. Marks, 26, chosen to sleep on the side of town where she works, or had Mr. Tramel and Ms. McFall, who are both in their early 20s, made their camp where they had eaten their dinner, their fortunes might be different.Arkansas accepted the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act. Texas did not. That makes Texarkana perhaps the starkest example of how President Obama\u2019s health care law is altering the economic geography of the country. The poor living in the Arkansas half of town won access to a government benefit worth thousands of dollars annually, yet nothing changed for those on the Texas side of the state line.After the Supreme Court decided in 2012 that states could not be compelled to expand Medicaid to cover more of their low-income residents, many politicians voiced fears that the poor in states that opted out of the expansion might flood into states that opted in.But none of the low-income Texarkana residents interviewed realized that moving to the other side of town might mean a Medicaid card. In fact, health researchers and those who work with the poor expect very few Americans to move between states to take advantage of the law.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand what it is to move when you have nothing,\u201d said Jennifer Laurent, the executive director of Randy Sams\u2019 Outreach Shelter, where Ms. Marks is staying until she puts together enough savings from her two low-wage jobs to find her own place. \u201cTo risk everything \u2014 losing your bed, your sense of community \u2014 for an uncertain benefit? There\u2019s no way you want to risk that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure, anecdotally, that some people will move,\u201d said Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Harvard School of Public Health and a co-author of the study. \u201cBut is this a major budget issue for states expanding Medicaid? Will there be a major wave of people moving to get insurance? Probably not.\u201dPerhaps nowhere is the anomaly clearer, though, than in two-state Texarkana. This close-knit community, with about 66,000 residents altogether, has two mayors, two fire departments and two police departments. The Texas side is dry; liquor stores abound on the Arkansas side. And every autumn, the fierce high school rivalry between the Texas Tigers and the Arkansas Razorbacks flares anew.\u201cWe\u2019re an odd little area down here,\u201d said Prissy Hickerson, a Republican who represents Texarkana in the Arkansas House of Representatives.Both sides of Texarkana are largely middle and lower-middle class; its major employers are big-box stores, hospitals, chicken-processing plants, an Army depot and a tire factory. But unlike much of energy-rich Texas, it has seen its economy stagnate in recent years. Ms. Laurent said she struggled to meet more need with less money; grants and donations to the shelter dropped sharply last year.For the town\u2019s lowest-income residents, finding health care is one more hardship. Ms. Marks had a hole in her tooth this winter, she said, and went to the emergency room. They gave her a painkiller and a bill for $600, which she has ignored. The tooth remains so damaged that she can chew on only one side of her mouth.\u201cI know it\u2019s past due,\u201d she said in response to the letters the hospital has sent her. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just pay y\u2019all $600. I don\u2019t have $600.\u201dAnother resident at the Randy Sams\u2019 shelter, Ed Miller, 42, has congestive heart failure and sleep apnea. Recently, he went to the hospital and received a diagnosis of bronchitis too. Asked if he would consider moving to Arkansas to gain access to Medicaid, he responded, \u201cI might look into that.\u201dThe shelter helps its residents gain access to the government programs they are eligible for: food stamps, Social Security, disability, housing vouchers when available. Once, Ms. Laurent said, an Arkansas social worker came across the state line to see if anyone might be eligible for the Medicaid expansion.But even many qualified people resist using government services, because of fear, a lack of knowledge or a criminal conviction. \u201cThey just don\u2019t trust the government,\u201d Ms. Laurent said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been told no over and over and over again.\u201dAnd moving even a few blocks away might pose an insurmountable challenge. The Salvation Army shelter on the Arkansas side of town charges $6 a night, more than many of the very poor can afford. Randy Sams\u2019, on the Texas side, is free.\u201cI tell my clients: You\u2019ve got to have paper, or you\u2019ve got to have paper,\u201d Ms. Laurent said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have money, or you\u2019re going to have to fill out a lot of paperwork for benefits.\u201dMr. Tramel said he walked to Texas from Missouri, finding God and kicking a drug habit along the way. The trip took him 11 days. He has no Social Security card, birth certificate or driver\u2019s license, let alone a stable address. The paperwork challenge of establishing residency in a state and applying for benefits, he said, seemed overwhelming to him.\u201cMedicaid, I think that should be universal,\u201d he said, getting ready for the long walk back to his tent.Indeed, until the Supreme Court ruling, the Obama administration had intended for the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act to be universal, covering all adults earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line, about $15,500 annually for a single adult or $32,000 for a family of four.That\u2019s the way it is working out on the Arkansas side of the border, where health clinics and social service agencies are signing up eligible residents, even though this corner of the state is largely Republican and broadly resistant to the health care law.The expansion is already having an effect on the city\u2019s biggest provider of charity care, the nonprofit Christus St. Michael Health System. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more patients with a payer,\u201d said Chris Karam, its president, referring to those with health insurance coverage.On the Texas side, though, it\u2019s business as usual. \u201cIt makes me mad,\u201d said Mr. Miller, who is not receiving any federal benefits at the moment despite his array of illnesses. \u201cThey need to quit playing games with people\u2019s lives. Rich people. Government people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Ties With China Unravel, U.S. Companies Head to Mexico", "Date": "2014-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySALTILLO, Mexico \u2014 Jason Sauey calls them lemmings \u2014 all the American companies that rushed to China to make things like toys and toilet brushes, only to be searching now for alternatives in Mexico and the United States. His own family-owned plastics company, Flambeau, nearly made the same mistake around 2004, he said, when competitors contracting with China undercut prices and seized market share.Flambeau resisted, turning instead to its factory here in central Mexico. And now the company \u2014 which makes Duncan yo-yos, hunting decoys, plastic cases and an array of industrial items \u2014 is reaping the rewards, Mr. Sauey (pronounced SOW-ee) said. Revenues at its Mexican plant have grown by 80 percent since 2010, according to company records, prompting a search for a second location near Mexico City. And in the past year, a dozen corporations have come to Flambeau and requested bids on projects worth tens of millions of dollars for things like smartphone cases and car parts.\u201cThey\u2019re all looking for a new model,\u201d said Mr. Sauey at his offices in Middlefield, Ohio. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about cost; it\u2019s about speed of response and quality.\u201dWith labor costs rising rapidly in China, American manufacturers of all sizes are looking south to Mexico with what economists describe as an eagerness not seen since the early years of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s. From border cities like Tijuana to the central plains where new factories are filling farmland, Mexican workers are increasingly in demand.Many American companies are expanding in Mexico \u2014 including well-known brands like Caterpillar, Chrysler, Stanley Black & Decker and Callaway Golf \u2014 adding billions of dollars in investment and helping to drive the economic integration that President Obama and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto have both described as vital to growth.As that happens, some companies are cutting back in China and heading to Mexico to manufacture an array of products, like headsets (Plantronics); hula hoops (Hoopnotica); toilet brushes (Casabella); grills and outdoor furniture (Meco Corporation); medical supplies (DJO Global); and industrial cabinets (Viasystems Group).And while in some cases a move to Mexico is tied to job cuts in the United States, economists say that the American economy benefits more from outsourcing manufacturing to Mexico than to China because neighbors tend to share more of the production. Roughly 40 percent of the parts found in Mexican imports originally came from the United States, compared with only 4 percent for Chinese imports, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private research group.Such comparisons appear to have blunted some of the scorn that greeted American companies moving production to Mexico in the 1990s. And yet, for the economic relationship to reach its full potential, experts, officials and executives say, the United States needs to make trade efficiency as important as border security. Long waits at the border continue to frustrate many companies. At the same time, Mexico needs to overcome longstanding problems like education, organized crime and corruption.However, for every successful Flambeau, there seems to be a KidCo, another Midwestern manufacturer, which gave up trying to move production from China to Mexico last year.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more convenient to fly to Mexico than to China,\u201d said Ken Kaiser, the company\u2019s owner. \u201cBut we just couldn\u2019t find a way to get an advantage by moving. It took forever just to get a price quote.\u201dDozens of interviews with executives, economists and American and Mexican officials over the past year show that what many companies are discovering is that there is not one Mexico, but many. Despite many signs of promise, Mexico is still a country of vast differences in efficiency and education, where only a small minority of the population has the training needed to compete with the world. Especially for the crowded middle of American manufacturing \u2014 the family-owned, medium-size businesses like KidCo and Flambeau \u2014 Mexico disappoints as often as it satisfies.Ed Juline, a manufacturing consultant in Guadalajara who came to Mexico in 2001 with IBM, has seen many companies both attracted and repelled. Like others who help American businesses in Mexico, he described last year as a tipping point. With studies showing Mexico rapidly reaching the same cost level as China for the production of certain products, dozens of companies came to him \u2014 including KidCo \u2014 looking for help to find a Mexican factory to contract with or buy.Business owners were in a rush. Some had tired of the travel to China or the six- to 10-week wait for orders to arrive from across the Pacific. Others said their Chinese suppliers were raising prices even as quality declined.At KidCo\u2019s headquarters outside Chicago, the headaches were mounting. Last year began with a factory in northern China that produced the company\u2019s best-selling products, a series of child-safety gates, demanding a 10 to 12 percent pay increase. Then an entire shipment of wooden gates arrived with a major flaw. \u201cThat\u2019s when we realized we really needed to have backup supply,\u201d said Mr. Kaiser, 61, who contacted Mr. Juline.Mr. Juline did have some success to point to. One of his clients, Casabella, a broom, brush and mop company from Long Island, had recently completed a deal with a factory near Mexico City to produce about $800,000 worth of brushes.But success turned out to be a rarity. The more Mr. Juline traveled around Mexico seeking partners for American manufacturers, he said, the more he realized that many Mexican business owners were unwilling to take on a surge of new business, either because they could not line up suppliers or credit, or because they feared demands for money from government inspectors or gangs.Guillermo Calderon, the factory manager for Dise\u00f1o Global, said his response to KidCo\u2019s bid request may have seemed high \u2014 about 20 percent above the production price in China \u2014 but that was because he wanted to make sure his company took on as little risk as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to look at the opportunities you already have instead of looking outside,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if we get a 40,000-piece order and then they leave?\u201dFlambeau\u2019s experience has been more positive. Since Mr. Sauey joined the business in 1985 at the urging of his father, a co-founder, sales have grown to $230 million, up from $65 million. And as tours of its plants in Saltillo and in rural Ohio revealed, the company has largely thrived through a calculated mix of investment in Mexico and in the United States.Mr. Sauey, 52, compact and serious, a passionate libertarian with an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago, insisted that cross-border production keeps American companies alive. At the plant in Middlefield, a small town near Cleveland where Mennonites steer horses clear of pickup trucks, and where most factories have already closed, he pointed to a hulking contraption with robotic arms sprouting from the back. \u201cThis is what helps keep us here,\u201d he said. The machine cost $2 million. It turns the raw materials of hard plastic into one of Flambeau\u2019s best-selling products, cases for art supplies.A generation ago, Mr. Sauey said, the factory in Middlefield did about $14 million in sales. Now, because of investments in more sophisticated technology, it does twice that with the same number of employees, about 180.The factory in Mexico has more space, many more employees \u2014 about 480, making about $17.70 a day \u2014 and more machines, many bought used. Both factories will generate roughly the same amount of revenue, according to company estimates. But while the Middlefield plant focuses on high-end plastic cases for everything from guns to medical supplies, the Saltillo factory makes simpler products \u2014 bottles for windshield washer fluid, yo-yos, hunting decoys.Flambeau is not immune to the problems that kept KidCo in China. \u201cIn Mexico, almost right is good enough; second best is fine,\u201d said Edward Treanor, Flambeau\u2019s factory manager in Saltillo.Worker turnover, maintenance troubles and inconsistent quality have been a drag on the bottom line for years. But because Mexico is closer than China, Mr. Treanor added, Flambeau could do more about it: a few months ago, the company sent a trusted American employee to oversee maintenance full time and improve factory operations.Experts say that these are the kinds of companies succeeding now in Mexico, those big enough to manage their own factories and those that did not give up their technical knowledge by outsourcing to China.\u201cThere are a lot of examples of clients who were in Mexico, went to China and now want to come back, and most of them have given up their expertise in manufacturing,\u201d said Scott Stanley, a senior vice president at North American Production Sharing, one of the largest firms to help American companies set up production facilities in Mexico.To draw more companies now, executives, officials and experts say, Mexico and the United States will need to become better neighbors, more focused on sharing labor and moving products.Mr. Wilson at the Mexico Institute called specifically for a focus on \u201cglobally literate workforces in both countries.\u201d\u201cAt a very basic level, that means teaching more Spanish in the U.S. and more English in Mexico,\u201d he said. Other, more immediate changes are also necessary, he added, including shorter wait times at the border, better roads and productivity gains in Mexico \u2014 lowering the cost of electricity, for example. After all, as the rise of China showed once before, there is no guarantee that Mexican and American manufacturing will stay attractive for long.As Mr. Sauey notes, today\u2019s global economy has increasingly come to resemble the volatile market for yo-yos or any other fad: the ups and downs come and go faster than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s like shooting to the moon when the spikes happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like falling off a cliff when it ends.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Dismal Quarter, a Rosy Outlook", "Date": "2014-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHROUGHOUT the economic recovery since the Great Recession officially ended in the summer of 2009, consumers have generally remained doubtful that the economy really has gotten better. Now, as they finally conclude that the business climate has improved, a hitherto perfect recession indicator has sounded a warning.The Conference Board reported this week that in June more of the people it polled believed that business was good than thought it was bad. The margin \u2014 23 percent to 22.8 percent \u2014 was narrow and could be reversed when the final June figure is released in a month. But there had been no such reading since January 2008, when the recession was just beginning.On Wednesday, the day after the Conference Board report, the Bureau of Economic Analysis sharply lowered its estimate of economic activity in the first three months of 2014, saying the overall economy shrank at a rate of 2.9 percent during the quarter, adjusted for inflation. It had earlier estimated smaller declines, which were blamed in large part on the weather.As is shown in the accompanying charts, the bureau said that the economy declined at an annual rate of 1.7 percent during the quarter on a nominal basis \u2014 that is, even before adjusting for inflation. Such nominal declines are rare. Since the government began keeping quarterly statistics on gross domestic product in 1947, it reported nominal declines in only 16 quarters before this year. The official recession arbiter, the National Bureau of Economic Research, later determined that the economy was in recession in at least part of each of those quarters.There were four post World War II recessions when nominal G.D.P. rose in each quarter, generally in periods of moderate to high inflation. But in the other seven recessions, there was always at least one quarter when nominal G.D.P. fell.The economic research bureau uses real G.D.P. figures as one indicator in determining whether the economy is in recession, but also looks at industrial production, retail sales and employment. None of those now seem to be pointing to an economic downturn.It seems likely that the first-quarter fall in nominal G.D.P. was caused by several factors that are unlikely to repeat. The level of inventories plunged, partly because of the weather. Without the impact of inventories, the economy would have shown a small increase, in nominal terms. Health care spending was also surprisingly low, and probably recovered in the quarter now ending.Since 1967, the Conference Board, as part of its consumer confidence survey, has been asking consumers whether they thought business conditions were good, average or bad. The accompanying charts do not include those who viewed business conditions as normal. Until June, the proportion of consumers thinking conditions were bad had exceeded the proportion who thought they were good for 76 consecutive months. The longest previous periods of continued negative consensus were 44 months in the early 1980s and 46 months in the early 1990s. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Limits of the Fed", "Date": "2014-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Federal Reserve is expected to conclude its two-day meeting on Wednesday afternoon with another $10 billion scale-back of its monthly bond purchases. At that pace, the bond-buying program \u2014 an effort to stimulate the economy by lowering long-term interest rates \u2014 will be over by December at the latest.Unfortunately, the slow and steady withdrawal of stimulus has not been accompanied by a slow and steady improvement in economic conditions. Rather, since the economy emerged from recession in mid-2009, growth has averaged a sluggish 2 percent or so \u2014 year in and year out. The final estimate, to be released at the end of June, is expected to be worse still. Even if growth rebounds as projected, overall economic performance for the year would still end up around 2 percent. That is not a cause for optimism. In a normal business cycle, low interest rates are usually enough to generate sufficient demand to boost economic growth to its historical average of roughly 3 percent. But there is nothing normal about the present cycle. The Fed has extracted about all the juice it can from low rates and continues to squeeze. It could also spur investment by tolerating higher inflation than its 2 percent target. But the basic problem \u2014 spurring demand on the part of consumers and borrowers \u2014 is outside its purview. Only Congress can provide the extra dollars for that, but lawmakers have been unwilling or unable to take action, even just to provide basics like federal unemployment benefits or highway and bridge repair. Given that failure to act, it is a wonder the economy has managed to grow at 2 percent. To assume that it will continue to do so or that it will fully recover without the government sector engaging in a meaningful way is to hope against evidence. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bolinas, Calif., the Town That Didn't Want Company", "Date": "2014-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNext StopThe Grand Hotel is neither, really. Forty-five years ago \u2014 before the poets Robert Creeley and Lawrence Ferlinghetti bought houses nearby; before a food co-op and a naturopathic store opened down the street; before the rustic surfing town of Bolinas, Calif., was the sort of place where a tourist would consider spending the night \u2014 the Grand Hotel was merely Vic Amoroso\u2019s house, with a garage that doubled as a bric-a-brac shop. \u201cWe found a huge old-fashioned sign in the bushes that said Grand Hotel,\u201d Mr. Amoroso said. \u201cWe liked it, so we put it up, and people started coming around asking for a room. I\u2019d say, \u2018No, it\u2019s just a sign.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Eventually, he gave in: He and his family moved into the shed out back, and the two tatty bedrooms in the main house are now 20 percent of the town\u2019s available lodging. Still, Mr. Amoroso is a reluctant concierge. \u201cHow did you find this place?\u201d he asked, uncheerfully, when I called to book a room. His driving directions were forbidding: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t try it after dark. The turn off the highway is marked, but it will not say \u2018Bolinas\u2019 anywhere, and you might miss it. That\u2019s on purpose.\u201d I was prepared for this. The first two things I had heard about Bolinas, an unincorporated township 20 miles northwest of San Francisco, were that it was ruggedly beautiful and that I should stay away. The town, population 1,600, is bounded by seawater on three sides \u2014 Bolinas Lagoon, Bolinas Bay and the Pacific \u2014 and is isolated by temperament as well as geography. To inhibit development, the public-utility board has not issued a new water meter since 1971. Whenever the state tries to put up road signs leading to the town, industrious locals tear them down. \u201cThey are pretty hostile to outsiders,\u201d a friend who was raised nearby told me. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of people\u2019s tires getting slashed.\u201d Despite this \u2014 or, really, because of it \u2014 Bolinas has developed a reputation as a sort of suburban preserve. While San Francisco is racked by a citywide battle over hyperinflated housing prices, Bolinas markets itself (quietly) as a bulwark against change. As tourists, my wife and I were drawn to the idea of a Marin County oasis, eternally idyllic and somehow immune to shopping malls. Could it be real, we wondered, or was it just an aspiration? We disregarded Mr. Amoroso\u2019s directions and found the Grand Hotel the way people find any place these days: We entered the address into our GPS system. After 45 minutes of deliriously beautiful northbound driving on Highway 1, a calm voice told us precisely when to turn. We stopped at a roadside farm stand \u2014 open 24 hours, payment enforced by the honor system \u2014 and bought radishes so spicy they made our eyes water. Then we parked in town: a few wooden clapboard houses lining a sleepy main drag that dead-ends at the ocean. There was one gas station, one hardware store, no traffic light and three surf shops. We stopped at Bobolicious Smoothie Lounge for a Peace Train (acai, blueberry, cacao) and a Cinnamon Girl (coffee, cashews, whey protein), and walked down Wharf Road to the beach, where we took photos of the excellent graffiti murals lining the sea wall. The sky was gray, and the sand was pebbly and brown; a few intrepid surfers were out in wet suits, but the waves were small. (Bolinas spreads many bad rumors about itself in order to dispel tourists, but at least one seems to be true: For postcard-perfect sunbathing and gnarly breaks, try another beach.) A yoga class was in progress at the community center. In the adjacent lot, we stopped inside the Free Box, a shed full of donated objects that passers-by are encouraged to take. On offer when we visited: musty parkas, back issues of National Geographic and a stuffed polyester goose. We left empty-handed.Next door was the Bolinas People\u2019s Store, a food co-op stocked with bulk granola and high-quality local produce. The store sold copies of the Bolinas Hearsay News, a mimeographed triweekly with hyperlocal classified ads (\u201cLost: Metal Bucket With Gourd Rattle\u201d). Also for sale were three-dollar coins, unique to the area, which were emblazoned with a lighthouse, a cow and the motto \u201cStrength in Community.\u201d\u201cWhat are these for?\u201d I asked the clerk.\u201cI have no [expletive] idea,\u201d he said, smiling.We found the People\u2019s Park, a patch of grass the size of a small city block, and set out a picnic of store-made hummus, sourdough, black tomatoes and an armful of perfect avocados. In the middle of the park, a cob oven was under construction. On its roof, a middle-aged man, wearing a lilac-colored turban and a long white beard, lay on his belly, holding a level. \u201cIt\u2019s not done yet,\u201d he shouted when he saw us looking up at him. \u201cIn a few weeks, you\u2019ll be able to bake pizzas!\u201dLater, we ate at the town\u2019s only real restaurant (the Coast Cafe), where the blackberry pie was as outstanding as our server promised it would be, and drank at the only bar (Smiley\u2019s). We browsed its barter-economy bookstore, and bought fresh eggs from a clerk at a consignment shop. The locals were uniformly friendly, at least in person. Our tires were not slashed. Officially, though, Bolinas maintains its isolationism. Unlike nearby towns such as Sausalito and Mill Valley, Bolinas has no website, much less a chamber of commerce. Reclusion is part of the town\u2019s appeal. Several friends in San Francisco, upon hearing where we were headed, said, \u201cI love that place \u2014 and no one knows about it!\u201d Two doors down from the Grand Hotel, a charming three-bedroom Craftsman house was for sale. Terry Donohue, a stout woman with blond and silver hair, was the real estate agent conducting the open house. \u201cI found Bolinas 20 years ago and fell in love with it,\u201d she said. \u201cEven then, people would say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to come here!\u2019 and, in the same breath, \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone else!\u2019\u00a0\u201d She made a pshaw face. \u201cThe surest way to make people want to come is to tell them not to. Look, I want this place to stay special as much as anyone. But bringing in new people, wealthier people, doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing, if they\u2019re self-selected people who understand the spirit of the place.\u201d A few days later, Ms. Donohue received an offer on the house: $1,219,000.\u201cIt\u2019s understandable why people here are cagey,\u201d Kerry Gilmore, a flooring contractor from Sacramento who was renting the Grand Hotel\u2019s other room, said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to ruin a place like this with an influx of too many people and too much money, and they\u2019re fighting against that.\u201d To a remarkable degree, they have succeeded. Greenwich Village is now overrun with N.Y.U. sophomores buying bubble tea; on the corner of Haight and Ashbury, a clothing store sells $175 shirts; but Bolinas has remained a Brigadoon, where it is always a sunny day in 1973. The architecture of the place has hardly changed in years. A Whole Foods would be as incongruous as a spaceport. The resulting vibe is a sort of hippie conservatism: baby boomers with graying ponytails who stand athwart history, yelling \u201cStop.\u201d Does Bolinas live up to its own hype? We found that it is a genuinely charming place, although it sometimes feels more like a theater set than a town. And it\u2019s heartening to see how some of the downsides of gentrification can be avoided, or at least staved off. Ultimately, though, Bolinas\u2019s battle against time is quixotic. The town will change; it is already changing.\u201cDo you know the schedule?\u201d I asked.\u201cNot really, dude,\u201d he said, giving me a puzzled look. \u201cCheck online.\u201dIF YOU GOAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Text of Obama\u2019s Remarks on Iraq", "Date": "2014-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Good afternoon, everybody. I just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in Iraq. We\u2019ve been meeting regularly to review the situation since ISIL, a terrorist organization that operates in Iraq and Syria, made advances inside of Iraq. As I said last week, ISIL poses a threat to the Iraqi people, to the region and to U.S. interests. So today I wanted to provide you an update on how we\u2019re responding to the situation.First, we are working to secure our embassy and personnel operating inside of Iraq. As president, I have no greater priority than the safety of our men and women serving overseas. So I\u2019ve taken some steps to relocate some of our embassy personnel, and we\u2019ve sent reinforcements to better secure our facilities.Second, at my direction we have significantly increased our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets so that we\u2019ve got a better picture of what\u2019s taking place inside of Iraq, and this will give us a greater understanding of what ISIL is doing, where it\u2019s located and how we might support efforts to counter this threat.Third, the United States will continue to increase our support to Iraqi security forces. We\u2019re prepared to create joint operation centers in Baghdad and northern Iraq, to share intelligence and coordinate planning to confront the terrorist threat of ISIL. And through our new Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, we\u2019re prepared to work with Congress to provide additional equipment. We have had advisers in Iraq through our embassy, and we\u2019re prepared to send a small number of additional American military advisers -- up to 300 -- to assess how we can best train, advise and support Iraqi security forces going forward.American forces will not be returning to combat in Iraq, but we will help Iraqis as they take the fight to terrorists who threaten the Iraqi people, the region and American interests as well.Fourth, in recent days we\u2019ve positioned additional U.S. military assets in the region. Because of our increased intelligence resources, we\u2019re developing more information about potential targets associated with ISIL, and going forward, we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it. If we do, I will consult closely with Congress and leaders in Iraq and in the region. I want to emphasize, though, that the best and most effective response to a threat like ISIL will ultimately involve partnerships where local forces like Iraqis take the lead.Finally, the United States will lead a diplomatic effort to work with Iraqi leaders and the countries in the region to support stability in Iraq. At my direction, Secretary Kerry will depart this weekend for meetings in the Middle East and Europe, where he\u2019ll be able to consult with our allies and partners. And just as all Iraqis\u2019 neighbors must respect Iraq\u2019s territorial integrity, all of Iraq\u2019s neighbors have a vital interest in ensuring that Iraq does not descend into civil war or become a safe haven for terrorists.Above all, Iraqi leaders must rise above their differences and come together around a political plan for Iraq\u2019s future. Shia, Sunni, Kurds, all Iraqis must have confidence that they can advance their interests and aspirations through the political process rather than through violence. National unity meetings have to go forward to build consensus across Iraq\u2019s different communities. Now that the results of Iraq\u2019s recent election has been certified, a new parliament should convene as soon as possible.The formation of a new government will be an opportunity to begin a genuine dialogue and forge a government that represents the legitimate interests of all Iraqis.Now, it\u2019s not the place for the United States to choose Iraq\u2019s leaders. It is clear, though, that only leaders that can govern with an inclusive agenda are going to be able to truly bring the Iraqi people together and help them through this crisis.Meanwhile, the United States will not pursue military actions that support one sect inside of Iraq at the expense of another. There\u2019s no military solution inside of Iraq, certainly not one that is led by the United States. But there is an urgent need for an inclusive political process, a more capable Iraqi security force, and counterterrorism efforts that deny groups like ISIL a safe haven.In closing, recent days have reminded us of the deep scars left by America\u2019s war in Iraq. Alongside the loss of nearly 4,500 American patriots, many veterans carry the wounds of that war, and will for the rest of their lives. Here at home, Iraq sparked vigorous debates and intense emotions in the past, and we\u2019ve seen some of those debates resurface.But what\u2019s clear from the last decade is the need for the United States to ask hard questions before we take action abroad, particularly military action. The most important question we should all be asking, the issue that we have to keep front and center, the issue that I keep front and center, is, what is in the national security interest of the United States of America? As commander in chief, that\u2019s what I stay focused on. As Americans, that\u2019s what all of us should be focused on.And going forward, we will continue to consult closely with Congress, we will keep the American people informed, we will remain vigilant, and we will continue to do everything in our power to protect the security of the United States and the safety of the American people.So with that, I\u2019m going to take a couple of questions. I\u2019ll start with Colleen McCain Nelson of The Wall Street Journal.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Do you have any confidence in Prime Minister al-Maliki at this point? And can your -- can Maliki bring political stability to Iraq?PRESIDENT OBAMA: As I said, it\u2019s not our job to chose Iraq\u2019s leaders. Part of what our patriots fought for during many years in Iraq was the right and the opportunity for Iraqis to determine their own destiny and chose their own leaders. But I don\u2019t think it -- there\u2019s any secret that, right now at least, there is deep divisions between Sunni, Shia and Kurdish leaders. And as long as those deep divisions continue or worsen, it\u2019s going to be very hard for an Iraqi central government to direct an Iraqi military to deal with these threats.And so we\u2019ve consulted with Prime Minister Maliki. And we\u2019ve said that to him privately. We\u2019ve said publicly, that whether he is prime minister or any other leader aspires to lead the country, that it has to be an agenda in which Sunni, Shia and Kurd all feel that they have the opportunity to advance their interest through the political process.And we\u2019ve seen over the last two years -- actually dating back to 2008, 2009, but I think worse over the last two years -- the sense among Sunnis that their interests were not being served, that legislation that had been promised around, for example, de- Baathification had been stalled. I think that you hear similar complaints that the government in Baghdad has not sufficiently reached out to some of the tribes and been able to bring them into a process that, you know, gives them a sense of being part of -- of a unity government or a single nation-state.And that has to be worked through. Part of the reason why we saw better-equipped Iraqi security forces with larger numbers not be able to hold contested territory against ISIL probably reflects that lack of a sense of commitment on the part of Sunni communities to work with Baghdad. And that has to be fixed if we\u2019re going to get -- get through this crisis.Jim Acosta.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Americans may look at this decision that you\u2019re making today as a sneak preview of coming attractions that the number of advisers that you\u2019re planning to send in may just be the beginning of a boots-on-the-ground scenario down the road. Why is Iraq\u2019s civil war in the national security interest of the United States? And are you concerned about the potential for mission creep?PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think we always have to guard against mission creep. So let me repeat what I\u2019ve said in the past: American combat troops are not going to be fighting in Iraq again. We do not have the ability to simply solve this problem by sending in tens of thousands of troops and committing the kinds of blood and treasure that has already been expended in Iraq. Ultimately, this is something that is going to have to be solved by the Iraqis.It is in our national security interests not to see an all-out civil war inside of Iraq, not just for humanitarian reasons, but because that ultimately can be destabilizing throughout the region, and in addition to having strong allies there that we are committed to protecting, obviously, issues like energy and global energy markets continues to be important.We also have an interest in making sure that we don\u2019t have a safe haven that continues to grow for ISIL and other extremist jihadist groups who could use that as a base of operations for planning and targeting ourselves, our personnel overseas and eventually the homeland. And you know, if they accumulate more money, they accumulate more ammunition, more military capability, larger numbers, that poses great dangers not just to allies of ours like Jordan, which is very close by, but it also poses, you know, a great danger, potentially, to Europe and ultimately the United States.We have already seen inside of Syria that -- or groups like ISIL that right now are fighting with other extremist groups or an Assad regime that was nonresponsive to Sunni majority there that that has attracted more and more jihadists or would-be jihadists, some of them from Europe. They then start traveling back to Europe, and that, over time, can create a cadre of terrorists that could harm us.So we have humanitarian interests in preventing bloodshed. We have strategic interests in stability in the region.We have counterterrorism interests. All those have to be addressed.The -- the initial effort for us to get situational awareness through, you know, the -- the reconnaissance and surveillance that we\u2019ve already done, coupled with some -- some of our best people on the ground doing assessments of exactly what the situation is, starting, by the way, with the perimeter around Baghdad and making sure that that\u2019s not overrun -- that\u2019s a good investment for us to make.But that does not -- that does not foreshadow a larger commitment of troops to actually fight in Iraq. That would not be effective in meeting the core interests that we have.Q: Just very quickly, do you wish you had left a residual force in Iraq? Any regrets about that decision in 2011?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, keep in mind that wasn\u2019t a decision made by me. That was a decision made by the Iraqi government. We offered a modest residual force to help continue to train and advise Iraqi security forces. We had a core requirement, which we were require in any situation where we have U.S. troops overseas, and that is -- is that they are provided immunity at the -- since they are being invited by the sovereign government there, so that if, for example, they end up acting in self-defense if they are attacked and find themselves in a tough situation, that they\u2019re not somehow hauled before a foreign court. That\u2019s a core requirement that we have for U.S. troop presence anywhere.The Iraqi government and Prime Minister Maliki declined to provide us that immunity. And so -- I think it is important, though, to recognize that despite that decision, that we have continued to provide them with very intensive advice and support and have continued throughout this process over the last five years to not only offer them our assistance militarily, but we\u2019ve also continued to urge the kinds of political compromises that we think are ultimately necessary in order for them to have a functioning multi-sectarian democracy inside the country.Juliet. Juliet Eilperin. (Where are you ?).Q: (Off mic.) Mr. President, you just mentioned Syria a moment ago?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.Q: The United States has been slow to provide significant weapons and training directly to the Syrian opposition. Does the expansion of the Syria war into Iraq change your mind about the type of weapons and training you\u2019re now willing to give the opposition there? Is that what prompted Secretary Kerry to say of Syria, we are augmenting our assistance in significant ways? And can you elaborate on what you\u2019re doing now that you weren\u2019t doing before?PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, that -- that assessment about the dangers of what was happening in Syria has existed since we -- since the very beginning of the Syrian civil war. The question has never been whether we thought this was a serious problem. The question has always been, is there the capacity of moderate opposition on the ground to absorb and counteract extremists that might have been pouring in, as well as an Assad regime, supported by Iran and Russia, that outmanned them and was ruthless?And so we have consistently provided that opposition with support. Oftentimes the challenge is, if you have former farmers or teachers or pharmacists who now are taking up opposition against a battle-hardened regime with support from external actors that have a lot at stake, how quickly can you get them trained?How effective are you able to mobilize them? And you know, that continues to be a challenge. And even before the situation that we saw with ISIL going into Iraq, we had already tried to maximize what we can do to support a moderate opposition that not only can counteract the brutality of Assad, but also can make sure that in the minds of Sunnis, they don\u2019t think that their only alternative is either Mr. Assad or extremist groups like ISIL or al-Nusra.Q: (Off mic) -- what you might be doing differently, as the secretary of state alluded to?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think that the key to both Syria and Iraq is going to be a combination of what happens inside the country, working with moderate Syrian opposition, working with an Iraqi government that is inclusive, and us laying down a more effective counterterrorism platform that gets all the countries in the region pulling in the same direction. And I alluded to this in the West Point speech. This is -- I talked about it today with respect to the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund. There is going to be a long-term problem in this region in which we have to build and partner with countries that are committed to our interests, our values.And at the same time we have immediate problems with terrorist organizations that may be advancing. And rather than try to play whack-a-mole wherever these terrorist organizations may pop up, what we have to do is to be able to build effective partnerships, make sure that they have capacity. Some of the assets that have been devoted solely to Afghanistan over the last decade we\u2019ve got to shift to make sure that we have coverage in the Middle East and North Africa.You look at a country like Yemen -- a very impoverished country and one that has its own sectarian or ethnic divisions -- there\u2019s -- we do have a committed partner in President Hadi and his government. And we have been able to help to develop their capacities without putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground, at the same time as we\u2019ve got enough CT, or counterterrorism, capabilities that we\u2019re able to go after folks that might try to hit our embassy or might be trying to export terrorism into Europe or the United States.And looking at how we can create more of those models is going to be part of the solution in dealing with both Syria and Iraq. But in order for -- for us to do that, we still need to have actual governments on the ground that we can partner with and that we\u2019ve got some confidence are going to pursue the political policies of inclusiveness -- in Yemen, for example, a wide-ranging national dialogue that took a long time but helped to give people a sense that there is a legitimate political outlet for grievances that they may have.Peter Maer.Q: Thank you, sir. Going back to where you see Prime Minister al-Maliki playing a role at this point, you said that it\u2019s a time to rise above differences, that there\u2019s a need for more inclusive government. Is he a unifier? And how much clout does the United States ultimately have with any of the leadership in Iraq at this point, really?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, we still provide them significant assistance. I think they recognize that unlike some other players in the region, we don\u2019t have territorial ambitions in their country. We\u2019re not looking to control their assets or their energy. We want to make sure that we\u2019re vindicating the enormous effort and sacrifice that was made by our troops in giving them an opportunity to build a stable, inclusive society that can prosper and deliver for the basic needs and aspirations of the Iraqi people.And at the same time, they are a sovereign country. They have their own politics. And what we have tried to do is to give them our best advice about how they can solve their political problems. Now that they are in crisis, we are indicating to them that there\u2019s not going to be a simple military solution to this issue. If you start seeing the various groups inside of Iraq simply go to their respective corners, then it is almost certain that Baghdad and the central government will not be able to control huge chunks of their own country.The only way they can do that is if there are credible Sunni leaders, both at the national level and at the local level, who have confidence that a Shia majority, that the Kurds, that all those folks are committed to a fair and just governance of the country.Right now that doesn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s too much suspicion. There\u2019s too much mistrust.And the good news is that an election took place in which despite all this mistrust, despite all this frustration, despite all this anger, you still had millions of Iraqis turn out, in some cases in very dangerous circumstances. You now have a court that has certified those elections, and you have a constitutional process to advance government formation.So far, at least, the one bit of encouraging news that we\u2019ve seen inside of Iraq is that all the parties have said they continue to be committed to choosing a leadership and a government through the existing constitutional order.So what you\u2019re seeing, I think, is, as -- as the prospects of civil war heighten, many Iraqi leaders stepping back and saying, let\u2019s not plunge back into the abyss. Let\u2019s see if we can resolve this politically.But they don\u2019t have a lot of time, and you have a group like ISIL that is doing everything it -- that it can to descend the country back into chaos.And so one of the messages that we had for Prime Minister Maliki but also for the speaker of the house and, you know, the other leadership inside of Iraq is get going on this -- on this government formation.It\u2019ll make it a lot easier for them to shape a military strategy. It\u2019ll also make it possible for us to partner much more effectively than we can currently.Q: Given the prime minister\u2019s track record, is he a unifier? Can he play that role when -- after what we\u2019ve seen play out over the last couple of weeks has brought into play?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah. I think the test is -- is before him and other Iraqi leaders as we speak. Right now they can make a series of decisions. Regardless of what\u2019s happened in the past, right now is a moment where the fate of Iraq hangs in the balance. And the test for all of them is going to be where they can overcome the mistrust, the deep sectarian divisions, in some cases just political opportunism and say, this is bigger than anyone of us, and we\u2019ve got to make sure that we -- we do what\u2019s right for the Iraqi people. And -- and that\u2019s a challenge. That\u2019s not something that the United States can do for them. That\u2019s not something, by the way, that the United States armed forces can do for them. We can provide them the space, we can provide them the tools, but ultimately, they\u2019re going to have to make those decisions.In the meantime my job is to make sure that American personnel there is safe, that we are consulting with the Iraqi security forces, that we\u2019re getting a better assessment of what\u2019s on the ground and that we\u2019re recognizing the dangers of ISIL over the long term and developing the kinds of comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that we\u2019re going to need to deal with this issue.And that\u2019s going to involve some short-term responses to make sure that ISIL is not obtaining capacity to endanger us directly or our allies and partners, but it also is going to require some long-term strategies as well because part of what we\u2019ve seen with respect to ISIL is, you know, a broader trend that I talked about at West Point, a -- rather than a single network, a discrete network of terrorists, this fluid combination of hardened terrorists, disaffected local leadership. And where there\u2019s vacuums, they\u2019re filling it and creating the potential for, you know, serious danger for all concerned.All right? Thank you all.Q: (Off mic) -- on Iran, Mr. President -- on Iran, Mr. President, any word on what you are willing to do and who you\u2019re willing to work with?PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Inaudible) -- you know, our view is that Iran can play a constructive role if it is helping to send the same message to the Iraqi government that we\u2019re sending, which is that Iraq only holds together if it\u2019s inclusive and that -- if the interests of Sunni, Shia and Kurd are all respected. If Iran is coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of the Shia and it -- if it is framed in that fashion, then that probably worsens the situation and the prospect for a government formation that would actually be constructive over the long term.Q: (Off mic) -- sense of that right now?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, you know, I think that just as Iraq\u2019s leaders have to make decisions, I think Iran has heard from us, we\u2019ve indicated to them that it is important for them to avoid steps that might encourage the kind of sectarian splits that might lead to civil war.And you know, the one thing that I think is -- you know, has to be emphasized, we have deep differences with Iran across the board on a whole host of issues.Obviously what\u2019s happened in Syria in part is the result of Iran coming in hot and heavy on one side. And you know, Iran obviously should consider the fact that if it is -- if its view of the region is solely through sectarian frames, they could find themselves fighting a whole lot of places. And that\u2019s probably not good for the Iranian economy or the Iranian people over the long term either.I suspect there are folks in Iran who recognize that. You know, a Iraq in chaos on their borders is probably not in their interests. But old habits die hard. And you know, we\u2019ll have to see whether they can take what I think would be a more promise path over the next several days.All right? Thank you very much, everybody.Advertisement"}
